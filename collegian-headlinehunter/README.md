# 🦅 Headline Hunter

**Headline Hunter** is a fully automated visual puzzle game built for _The Daily Collegian_.

**The Premise:** The game pulls live imagery from the newspaper's RSS feed, zooms in 8x on a specific detail, and challenges the user to identify which headline belongs to the photo.

**The Goal:** Gamify news consumption and drive traffic to recent articles without requiring manual curation from editors.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Automated Fetching:**
    The app scrapes the _Daily Collegian_ RSS feed (`psucollegian.com`) in real-time to get the latest 50 articles.
2.  **High-Res Hacking:**
    It parses the thumbnail URLs (e.g., `image.jpg?resize=300`) and programmatically strips the query parameters to reveal the **original high-resolution source image**.
3.  **The Game Loop:**
    - **Round 1:** Shows the image at **8x zoom** (Extreme Close-up).
    - **Wrong Guess:** Zooms out to **4x**, then **2x**, revealing more context.
    - **Correct Guess:** Zooms out to **1x** (Full Image) and provides a direct link to read the story.
