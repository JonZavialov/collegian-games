    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After remaining at No. 4 in the USCHO poll for another week, the Nittany Lions concluded their seven-game road trip against the twelfth-ranked Cornell Big Red as they finished their home-and-home series of the 2025-26 season.</p>\n                <p>The blue-and-white did so without its lone goalscorer from their game against Cornell just before the end of the 2025 calendar year, Matilde Fantin. Fantin was recently named to Italy\u2019s Women\u2019s Hockey team for the 2026 Winter Olympics, joining fellow Olympians Tessa Janecke (United States) and Nicole Hall (Sweden).</p>\n                <p>However, what Penn State lost in Fantin, it gained in goaltender Katie DeSa, who made her first start since Jan. 2 when she left after the second period with an injury in Penn State\u2019s 5-1 loss to Ohio State. DeSa shutout the Big Red in December\u2019s contest, the 20th of her career, tying her with Josie Bothun (\u201824) for the most in program history.</p>\n                <p>DeSa performed to her standard, leading the Nittany Lions to a 5-1 win in a mid-week matchup in the final non-conference game of the season.</p>\n                <p>The senior netminder extended her shutout streak against Cornell to four periods after blanking them in the opening frame, stopping all eight shots she faced. She passed the first test she faced with ease, turning away multiple one-timers on a Cornell power play after the officials assessed Leah Stecker for a minor cross-checking penalty.</p>\n                <p>Penn State struck first with a goal off the stick of Janecke, her 17th of the season. Katelyn Roberts battled Cornell\u2019s Nora Curtis for the puck along the boards, ultimately forcing a turnover in Penn State\u2019s offensive zone. Janecke was able to pick up the loose puck and score on a shot from the faceoff dot to the right of the Big Red goaltender Annelies Bergmann.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions captain extended her point streak to six games with goals in each of the last four. Janecke extended her AHA goal-scoring lead and entered a tie for the sixth most in the nation with three other skaters.</p>\n                <p>Cornell was able to regroup during the first intermission and didn\u2019t waste any time in the second period, evening things at 1-1 just shy of 90 seconds into the period. The Big Red\u2019s Shannon Pearson picked up the puck in the neutral zone and entered her offensive zone in a 2-on-2 situation and beat DeSa under the blocker from the slot for her third goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>Just moments later, the carnelian-and-white took advantage of another Nittany Lion defensive collapse when Avi Adam entered the zone on a breakaway. Yet a diving attempt from Abby Stonehouse forced Adam to quickly recover and shoot, missing wide of the net.</p>\n                <p>After a series of multiple icing calls against the blue-and-white, Janecke circled back into her own zone and led a rush the other way and dumped the puck into the Cornell zone. Taya MacDonald was able to stop a clearing attempt from leaving the zone and found Maddy Christian coming up the boards, who received the pass, turned and ripped a shot that was deflected in front by Grace Outwater to give Penn State its second lead of the game, 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Outwater has now scored in three straight games and totaled 16 on the season, matching her career-high from last season in 15 fewer games. Her 27 points on the season set a new career-high for the sophomore winger.</p>\n                <p>With just over six minutes remaining in the second period, Cornell nearly knotted the score again, but a pass sent too wide left the Big Red looking for another opportunity.</p>\n                <p>They wouldn\u2019t see it in the second period as the blue-and-white continued to keep its foot on the gas with Christian leading the way, but came up short after being denied by Bergmann on two scoring opportunities.</p>\n                <p>After struggling to exit their own zone in the second, the third-period Nittany Lions continued to build momentum and controlled the puck well, maintaining possession in the Cornell zone. Roberts chipped the puck up to Janecke, who dished a cross-ice pass to a wide-open Stonehouse, who tapped in her sixth goal of the season with ease.</p>\n                <p>Penn State continued its dominance in the first half of the final period, outshooting Cornell 6-1 with its lone shot-on-goal coming on the second unsuccessful man-advantage of the night.</p>\n                <p>Continuing to challenge Bergmann from the middle of the slot between the two faceoff circles, Sophie Morrow extended the Nittany Lions\u2019 lead to three with her third goal of the season. With an assist from Kendall Butze, the Penn State defense remains one of the best in the country, breaking a tie for second in defensive scoring.</p>\n                <p>After being denied multiple times at the end of the second period, Christian netted her 14th goal of the season with no challenge on an empty-net goal.</p>\n                <p>With this win, Penn State finishes its non-conference play with a record of 7-3. Overall, Penn State improved its record to 22-4, giving the Nittany Lions the most wins in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will return home to Pegula Ice Arena, where they will host the Delaware Blue Hens for a weekend series beginning on Friday at 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE WOMEN'S HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 8 Penn State is 16-6 and winners of five straight games behind stout goaltending from Josh Fleming and multi-point nights from Gavin McKenna and Jackson Smith.</p>\n                <p>Following the Nittany Lions\u2019 series sweep of Notre Dame, coach Guy Gadowsky spoke with the media on Tuesday about injuries, his goaltending plans and his team\u2019s upcoming series against No. 5 Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>Injury updates</p>\n                <p>Penn State ranks second in the Big Ten standings after sweeping Minnesota and Notre Dame. But its recent success came at a cost.</p>\n                <p>Charlie Cerrato and Braeden Ford exited with injuries against the Golden Gophers and didn\u2019t play against Notre Dame. Gadowsky said last week that Ford will miss \u201ca significant amount of time\u201d and labeled Cerrato as \u201cday-to-day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky was hesitant to provide an update on Cerrato, the team\u2019s co-assist leader, before he labeled him \u201cdoubtful\u201d for this weekend\u2019s series against the Badgers.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m not 100% confident in giving you an update, but (Cerrato is) doubtful for this weekend,\u201d Gadowsky said.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions had so many injuries at forward entering last weekend\u2019s series that they didn\u2019t list a fourth-line right winger for Game 1 and omitted an extra skater from their lineup sheet in Game 2.</p>\n                <p>Mac Gadowsky, who exited Friday\u2019s victory after taking a hard hit along the boards and missed Saturday\u2019s contest, Shea Van Olm and Casey Aman are \u201cday-to-day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Goaltending plans</p>\n                <p>Penn State has used a goaltending tandem between Fleming and Kevin Reidler in 10 of its 11 series this season. And through 22 games, both rank inside the top six in goals-against average and save percentage among Big Ten goalies \u2014 a key reason Gadowsky\u2019s waited to name a true starter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI believe we're going to continue (both goaltenders) because it seems to be working very well,\u201d Gadowsky said. What we like most is that the goaltending trio supports each other. They're a great example of what teamwork is.\u201d</p>\n                <p>But Fleming has separated from his counterpart since the start of Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>In 10 starts, the freshman netminder sports a 1.82 goals-against average, which far outpaces Reidler\u2019s 2.92, and a conference-best 94.3 save percentage. He has stopped 86 of the 88 shots he\u2019s faced in his three starts since the international break.</p>\n                <p>Despite Fleming\u2019s impressive production, Gadowsky declined Tuesday to name him the starter, instead praising the success of the tandem.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a good thing going on right now, and I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but right now, (the goaltending tandem) is one thing that's really going well. I don't know why we try to fix something that's not broken.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Blocking the noise</p>\n                <p>The outside noise has been loud surrounding McKenna, the consensus No. 1 pick in the 2026 NHL Entry Draft. That wasn\u2019t a surprise.</p>\n                <p>But the way he\u2019s handled that pressure earned praise from his head coach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOne of the things that I admire most about (McKenna) is that he really doesn't listen to the noise, and he has a confidence about him, regardless of what some people say on some website,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI admire his internal compass. He\u2019s really been raised well by his family, by his community, to stay level-headed and worry about what he controls.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McKenna tallied his first multi-goal game in Penn State\u2019s 6-3 victory over Notre Dame last Saturday. His offensive output has ballooned since his return from international play, which left Gadowsky more impressed than surprised.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou look at the World Junior Championships, (McKenna) was one point from the lead and just turned 18,\u201d Gadowsky said. He\u2019s doing incredibly well, and we see him getting better every day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Now, the Lady Lions will hunt for their own, starting with the No. 25-ranked Huskies.</p>\n                <p>Washington</p>\n                <p>Washington experienced on-and-off success this year, winning games against Utah and then-No. 6 Michigan. However, it lost to struggling Purdue earlier in January.</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and the Huskies have a strong trio that contributes to most of their team\u2019s scoring. For Washington, it\u2019s three guards, and for Penn State, two guards and a center.</p>\n                <p>Sayvia Sellers leads the Huskies from the court through 18 games, scoring 18.4 points per game.</p>\n                <p>For the first month, it was just Sellers and Avery Howell, who averaged 12.8 points per game. But for the past month-and-a-half, senior Elle Ladine entered the mix after coming back from an injury in November.</p>\n                <p>Together, the three have combined for 42.3 points per game and over three steals per game.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions, however, have 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle, who has been the most efficient player in the country. Through 11 weeks, Merkle has averaged nearly 75% shooting from the court, scoring 19.3 points per game.</p>\n                <p>To go along with Merkle\u2019s power in the paint has been shifty Kiyomi McMiller, who\u2019s averaged 19.4 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Rounding out Penn State\u2019s big three is redshirt junior Moriah Murray, who has the second-most made 3-pointers in the Big Ten this season, making 55 triples.</p>\n                <p>With a star-studded trio in both lineups, Wednesday\u2019s matchup will likely come down to which team can get better opportunities from the bench.</p>\n                <p>Oregon</p>\n                <p>While Saturday\u2019s matchup won\u2019t be another top-25 matchup for the Lady Lions, it will be another contest against a premier Big Ten team who\u2019s had big wins this season.</p>\n                <p>Sitting at 14-6, Oregon had its fair share of celebrations this year with wins against then-No. 21 USC, Oregon State and Auburn. However, it\u2019s on its own losing streak with three straight losses to Michigan State, Iowa and Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State searches for its first win since December 20th \u2014 losing eight straight \u2014 the Ducks have more recent victories they can still garner momentum from.</p>\n                <p>Oregon\u2019s defense will be the biggest struggle for the Lady Lions, recording 11.8 steals per game.</p>\n                <p>Despite scoring just 6.1 and 7.4 points per game, Oregon\u2019s Ari Long and Sofia Bell have started all a majority of games this year, mainly due to their defensive toughness. The two currently rank in seventh and 15th in the conference in steals per game, combining for 73 total this season.</p>\n                <p>The Ducks\u2019 offense, however, comes from another pair of Oregon stars in Katie Fiso and Mia Jacobs.</p>\n                <p>Fiso has shot 49.2% from the court en route to 15.7 points per game, while Jacobs is tied for sixth in the Big Ten in made 3-pointers with 44.</p>\n                <p>If the two Ducks continue to perform at the top of their games, and Oregon\u2019s defense puts pressure on Penn State \u2014 a team that averages a conference-high 19.6 turnovers per game \u2014 Saturday\u2019s contest could be another \u201cL\u201d in the books for the Lady Lions.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Prior to the Hoosiers\u2019 recent run, comparisons could\u2019ve been made between Penn State men\u2019s basketball and Indiana football as both weren\u2019t known as consistent winning programs.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said he\u2019s watched the Hoosiers\u2019 turnaround in football under head coach Curt Cignetti closely, saying he tried to learn their approach of bringing potential sustainable success to a program.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think their organization, their commitment, the decisions they've made to be able to go to bat in the big boy batter's box has paid a dividend for them and put them in the position that they're in,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSo it's a lot of decisions, a lot of conversations you got to have, and then you got to go do it, and they did it, pretty impressive.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said recruiting and retention of high-level players is one aspect in particular he thinks can expedite building a program. Penn State has freshman guard Kayden Mingo, who is the highest-rated recruit in program history.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're recruiting high-level dudes. We got to get them. We got to retain them,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThe ones we have in our program that want to be here and do it the right way. We got to retain them. This is hard, and when you're losing everyone has answers or questions and all that stuff, but they're not in the building with us every day as we're trying to do this the right way and build it the right way.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are a finalist for 5-star 2026 guard Dylan Mingo, who ranks as the No. 5 player nationally by the 247Sports composite. Rhoades was asked if he thinks Penn State is currently in a position to land the highest levels of talent out of high school.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNot yet, but I have belief that we will, and we're moving forward,\u201d Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Morale of team</p>\n                <p>Penn State has lost its last five games and eight of its last nine matchups. The losing skid has included blowout losses and close contests that saw the Nittany Lions nearly pulling off upsets.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said the players are still working to get their first win in the Big Ten slate and have been coachable.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTo give them the respect I have for them and the way they're handling,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI mean, guys are disappointed and upset, but we don't have issues off the court or things that are getting in the way of what we're trying to do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions haven\u2019t won since a 90-67 victory over NC Central on Dec. 29, and they haven\u2019t beaten a power-conference opponent this year, as all nine of their wins came against. Quad 4 teams.</p>\n                <p>Still, Penn State\u2019s roster, which has eight freshmen, is impressing Rhoades in still putting in effort despite the season being off to a rough start.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have some young guys that are in big positions that a lot's on them, but win or lose, whatever the scenario is, if you keep learning from it, it's going to make you better,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIt's just hard. I mean, come on, it is where we are, but I've been proud of the guys for their response, especially with the morale.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Puff Johnson playing for Ohio State</p>\n                <p>Former Penn State forward Puff Johnson, who has already played in five seasons of collegiate basketball, transferred to Ohio State in the fall and was given a temporary retraining order, making him immediately eligible to play.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades spoke on the possibility of Johnson playing for the Nittany Lions this year, but it didn\u2019t work out.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPuff and I spoke about that, and we knew we were going to have a scholarship,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSo if he was eligible to come back, he had a scholarship. That changes with (revenue) share and NIL because we're not in a position where we can just lose money and all that stuff \u2026 We all moved on in a positive way without a doubt. He's a Penn State grad, and he gave us everything for two years. I really appreciate (him). He's a good kid.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall game</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are set to host Wisconsin inside Rec Hall at 7 p.m. Thursday. It\u2019ll be a change from the usual site of the Bryce Jordan Center, bringing back an old-school look.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe all love a little throwback in us, right?\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIt's an old arena. It's an old gym. People are on top of you now with the new court and the way it's configured, even more on top of you. I just think it's cool. Penn Staters love something different. I think sometimes being different and doing something cool like that is fun, fun for everybody.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to the Bryce Jordan Center opening, Penn State used to host its home games in Rec Hall from 1929-96, holding a record of 514-183. Rec Hall has a listed capacity of 6,846, and with bleachers close to the court, the atmosphere sounds louder than the typical game at the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Since Rhoades took over as the Nittany Lions\u2019 coach in 2023-24, Penn State has hosted a \u201cReturn to Rec\u201d promotion, which features one game inside Rec Hall per season. Notably, Penn State took down No. 12 Illinois on Feb. 21, 2024, by a score of 90-89 after game-winning free throws by forward Zach Hicks.</p>\n                <p>Fans stormed the court after the Nittany Lions\u2019 upset over the Fighting Illini.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is entertainment, right? And it's supposed to be about having a cool experience,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cYeah, we want to win, and we want to do everything right, but we also want to make some decisions, so we're having a lot of fun trying to do this. I think playing in Rec Hall for a lot of people, old Penn Staters, new Penn Staters, basketball fans, it's a cool place to see a college basketball game, and it's cool for our players to be a part of that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said it\u2019s a possibility to play more than one game per season at Rec Hall, but noted the logistical needs of playing more games in the historic site.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of things come into play with moving a team or a program out of one building to another, and logistics and how much it impacts,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThen you have marketing and ticket sales and season ticket sales. I think there's a lot more to it than just say, \u2018Hey, let's go play.\u2019 Some of that is above my pay grade.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg & Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Is it time to pull the plug?</p>\n                <p>The Carolyn Kieger experiment has been a long-awaited process, as the winning culture has yet to be established. Now, in her seventh season, the pieces still do not fit.</p>\n                <p>In the midst of a dreadful season, Penn State holds a 7-12 record and is yet to secure a Big Ten win. This poses an important question: Does Kieger deserve another chance?</p>\n                <p>Noah Aberegg: A case for Kieger</p>\n                <p>While some are calling for Kieger's firing or for the entire basketball program to be dismantled, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the right time.</p>\n                <p>Sure, she\u2019s only produced one winning record in her six years with Penn State, with another to come. But given the current roster for the Lady Lions, one more year with the Marquette alum at the helm won\u2019t do much harm. In fact, it might be just what the blue and white need.</p>\n                <p>Throughout Kieger\u2019s time at Penn State, she hasn\u2019t had an established group of stars as she does now. Makenna Marisa was there for five years, but cycled through Leilani Kapinus, Ashley Owusu and Shay Ciezki.</p>\n                <p>This year, the Lady Lions have Kiyomi McMiller, Gracie Merkle, Moriah Murray, and a young handful of supporting cast members.</p>\n                <p>Besides Amiya Evans and Vit\u00f3ria Santana, the other nine athletes on Kieger\u2019s roster will have the opportunity to play again next year. If and when they do, that lineup will have another year of training and chemistry under its belt.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will be joined by incoming freshman Chikae Desdunes, the No. 51 athlete in the Class of 2026. McMiller will have another year to work on patience, control and shot selection, Merkle can improve on her defense and strength and the five current freshmen \u2014 all of whom have shown potential this year \u2014 will have a full year of college experience.</p>\n                <p>If Kieger retains her current roster and still produces the same results next year then it could be time to move on. Murray, Merkle and Maggie Mendelson will graduate, and McMiller likely won\u2019t stick around if her final year is to be a year of misery, given her star potential.</p>\n                <p>While people have said every year, \u201cThis is the Lady Lions\u2019 year,\u201d I believe it\u2019ll come next season, and if it doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s go time for Kieger.</p>\n                <p>Sam Simonic: The case against Kieger</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s time for her to go.</p>\n                <p>Any supporter of the Nittany Lions\u2019 football program understands the Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics, Pat Kraft doesn\u2019t mess around. When it comes to an underperforming coach at the helm, Penn State is forced to respond accordingly. And, rightfully so.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white hold prestige to its name. Beyond the court, Penn State athletics has cemented itself as a perennial power in nearly every sport.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not that Penn State is immune to down seasons, but rather it doesn\u2019t have consistent losing streaks. In basketball, and specifically in women\u2019s basketball, that standard has not been met. That is the dangerous part of keeping Kieger around.</p>\n                <p>Trial and error mark the brief adjustment period for any new coach in Happy Valley. However, a turnaround is expected in just a couple of years. In her seventh season, Kieger has made minimal improvements. If anything, it\u2019s gotten worse.</p>\n                <p>Kieger didn\u2019t fall under the Kraft umbrella. In fact, she was hired in 2019 under the direction of former Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics, Sandy Barbour. At the time, Kieger was viewed as an exciting hire, coming off much success at Marquette.</p>\n                <p>However, that success did not follow her to Penn State. Kieger was in charge of changing a struggling program. In many ways, a short-term rebuild was expected. But, season after season, few improvements were seen.</p>\n                <p>Across her time in State College, Kieger has only produced one winning season. That came in the 2023-24 season when the Lady Lions went 22-13 and made the WBIT. Since that season, Kieger has appeared to hit a plateau, having now tallied two of the worst seasons in her career, including this season.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, we are now in mid January and the Lady Lions are still without a Big Ten win, even after facing Rutgers, which was winless in the Big Ten, at home. A change certainly wouldn\u2019t guarantee rapid success, but it would give Penn State the full green light to embrace a rebuild.</p>\n                <p>Kieger was never able to do a rebuild, and it's evident. At this point, Penn State should search for a coach who can do just that.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s basketball entered last week's slate with two more chances to earn its first Big Ten win. The Lady Lions traveled to Columbus, Ohio, hoping to upset a ranked Ohio State for the second straight year. The blue and white also hosted a Rutgers team that was winless in conference play.</p>\n                <p>Coach Carolyn Kieger's squad couldn\u2019t get the job done in a blowout loss to the Buckeyes and fell just short in a close battle with the Scarlet Knights.</p>\n                <p>Penn State stands 7-12 on the season and 0-8 in the Big Ten. Even though the Lady Lions went winless, there were still both good and bad takeaways from the week.</p>\n                <p>Merkle stays efficient</p>\n                <p>Gracie Merkle has been consistent from the field all season and owns the nation's highest field-goal percentage at 74.9%. Despite the two losses, the 6-foot-6 center kept her efficiency.</p>\n                <p>The Mount Washington, Kentucky, native shot a combined 17-for-22, netting 21 points in each outing. Merkle impressed against No. 14 Ohio State, shooting 90.9% from the field, while also grabbing 11 rebounds to complete her double-double performance.</p>\n                <p>Against Rutgers, the redshirt junior wasn\u2019t as efficient from the field, but took multiple trips to the free-throw line, going 7-for-10. This ties Merkle\u2019s season high trips to the charity stripe, and was her third-best foul shooting performance this season.</p>\n                <p>Defense</p>\n                <p>On the defensive side of the ball, it was the tale of two stories for the Lady Lions. The blue and white gave up 108 points against the Buckeyes, marking its most points allowed this season. Penn State scored 84 points in the matchup, which would\u2019ve been enough to win more than half its games this season.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State led from start to finish and led by as many as 26 points. The Buckeyes shot over 56% from the field and just under 50% from three-point range. However, the Lady Lions forced 17 turnovers, including 11 steals.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white improved defensively against Rutgers, falling by a score of 76-72. The Scarlet Knights\u2019 scoring total fell under the 82.1 points per game that Penn State typically allows.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions held Rutgers to a 40.6% field-goal percentage and 36% from three-point range. The blue and white recorded eight steals and forced 12 turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Offensive struggles</p>\n                <p>Penn State posted strong scoring numbers and even exceeded its typical points-per-game average, but the Lady Lions also showed room for improvement.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white combined for 36 turnovers in its last two games, but 24 of those came against Ohio State. The Buckeyes capitalized on Penn State\u2019s struggles by scoring 39 points off turnovers. Additionally, Ohio State was able to net 27 fastbreak points. The Lady Lions only scored 11 points off 17 Buckeye turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Penn State shot over 46% from the field, but went 11-for-32 from beyond the arc and 3-for-9 from the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions had a better outing against the Scarlet Knights, in which they turned the ball over 12 times, which is their third-lowest mark this season. However, the blue and white only produced nine points off opponent turnovers as opposed to Rutgers\u2019 18.</p>\n                <p>Penn State produced a similar shooting performance to the one before, but once again struggled from deep and the foul line. The Lady Lions shot 5-for-25 from three-point range against Rutgers, and Moriah Murray, who went 8-for-17 from deep against the Buckeyes, shot 1-for-9 against the Scarlet Knights.</p>\n                <p>In that Rutgers game, at the charity stripe, the blue and white went 11-for-18, losing by just four points.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>On Dec. 30, the No. 4 Nittany Lions closed out 2025 with a 1-0 victory over No. 12 Cornell at Pegula Ice Arena behind freshman Matilde Fantin\u2019s lone goal. It was a test of longevity and stamina \u2014 who could outlast the other \u2014 and the blue and white came out on top in the third period.</p>\n                <p>Since the calendars changed, Penn State saw diminished results. The Nittany Lions were swept by No. 2 Ohio State, fell in overtime to unranked Mercyhurst, and endured a scare to Syracuse on Saturday as well, winning 3-2.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white have the opportunity to put the mid-season blues to rest. Penn State and the Big Red are set to close out the second and last game they\u2019ll face each other this season at 6 p.m. on Tuesday at Lynah Rink in Ithaca, New York.</p>\n                <p>Ranked opponents</p>\n                <p>Cornell returns home to the Lynah Rink from New Haven, Connecticut, where the Big Red suffered a 3-1 loss to No. 13 Yale on Saturday afternoon. With a 12-7-2 overall record, the last time that Cornell defeated a ranked team was on Nov. 15, when Karel Prefontaine scored the golden goal in overtime to secure a 4-3 victory.</p>\n                <p>Since then, the Big Red have struggled against the tougher competition. On Jan. 9, Cornell was on pace to take down No. 11 Clarkson, holding a 5-3 lead late in the third period. However, the Golden Knights potted a pair of power-play goals to force overtime. Ultimately, the contest ended in a draw nationally, despite the Big Red winning in a shootout.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions had success in their ranked affairs prior to their run-in with the Buckeyes. On Oct. 17 and Oct. 18, Penn State swept then-No. 15 Mercyhurst on home ice. Then, over a month later, the Nittany Lions split a two-game series with No. 7 Northeastern in Boston.</p>\n                <p>Scouting the Big Red</p>\n                <p>When glancing at Cornell\u2019s roster, it\u2019s hard to overlook goaltender Annelies Bergmann. With a .930 save-percentage and a 1.91 goals-against average, the junior from Detroit has kept the Big Red competitive in nearly every game they\u2019ve played. Bergmann also sits tied for sixth in the nation with four shutouts on the season.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Regalado and Piper Grober present the largest defensive threat, putting in solid performances against the Nittany Lions in their previous meeting. Regalado leads the defense in blocked shots with 27 on the season, with Grober following closely behind with 26.</p>\n                <p>However, Cornell\u2019s biggest contributor on both ends of the ice is Avi Adam. The senior from Wolfville, Nova Scotia, leads the Big Red with 21 points and 29 blocked shots as a proper two-way forward.</p>\n                <p>Absences, current and upcoming</p>\n                <p>Penn State will be playing without Fantin for the foreseeable future, as the Como, Italy, native returned to her home country to prepare for the upcoming Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games with Team Italy.</p>\n                <p>Similarly, this week will be the last for Tessa Janecke and Nicole Hall, as well. Following the Nittany Lions\u2019 series against Delaware in Happy Valley, Janecke and Hall are going overseas to play for Team USA and Team Sweden, respectively.</p>\n                <p>Goaltender Katie DeSa has been sidelined for the past five games with an undisclosed injury, allowing freshman Maddy Campbell to step up as the temporary starter. DeSa is tied for first in the nation with seven shutouts and is currently one away from breaking Penn State\u2019s all-time shutout record.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When Dane Dowiak speaks, his teammates listen.</p>\n                <p>The junior forward never shies away from speaking his mind. And he\u2019s sometimes brutally honest. But he can be, because he backs his words with an unmatched work ethic.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019s considered the strongest player on the team. He\u2019s unafraid to scrap for a loose puck along the boards or lay a booming hit to spark a comeback. He\u2019s willing to play any role asked of him with no complaints.</p>\n                <p>Bottom line: Dowiak is a team-first guy. It\u2019s why his teammates love him. It\u2019s why they respect him. And it\u2019s why they voted him the 12th captain in program history.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Dane) is very accountable to himself. He talks a big game, but he backs it up,\u201d Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky said. \u201cHe's an extremely strong, gritty guy. He loves Penn State and embodies it. Most importantly, he plays for the team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky lauded Dowiak\u2019s willingness to do \u201cthe little things\u201d that don\u2019t show up in the box score. Like getting pucks out of the defensive zone, winning face-offs, getting cross-checked as he pokes at a loose puck, and, as Gadowsky elegantly stated, \u201cgetting his ankles hacked.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dowiak\u2019s teammates recognize his unselfishness. They appreciate his authentic leadership style \u2014 one filled with both passion and compassion. They respect his ability to joke with them on the same day he airs them out for an embarrassing performance.</p>\n                <p>And they laud his willingness to never ask something of them he wouldn\u2019t do himself.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDane is a nails guy \u2014 a guy we all look to when things are tough,\u201d sophomore forward Braeden Ford said. \u201cWhen things are tough, you look for a guy to lead the way, you look for a guy to lead the charge, and Dane is the perfect guy to do that. He'll go through somebody on the wall. He'll go score a greasy goal. He's a guy that everybody looks to for some energy and to get us going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dowiak\u2019s leadership role has grown since his first collegiate season. But he\u2019s never needed a fancy title or a letter stitched on his jersey to motivate his teammates.</p>\n                <p>The Pittsburgh native didn\u2019t require a boost from his coaches to outwork everyone in the weight room as a freshman. He didn\u2019t complain when asked to play one game on the top scoring line and the next told to block shots and clear pucks on the penalty kill.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky said he always knew Dowiak embodied traits aligned with Penn State\u2019s captaincy. It\u2019s why the head coach entered the season with high expectations of his junior captain. And it\u2019s why he appeared unfazed to see his players accept Dowiak\u2019s leadership style.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe are seeing exactly what we saw from Dane the previous two (seasons), and I'm sure it\u2019s exactly why he got selected by his peers,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe does his job. He can play in every situation, and no matter what you ask of him, he never complains. He's never even hinted at wanting a different role. He'll do whatever is asked of him to the best of his ability.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Junior forward Reese Laubach is in his third season with Penn State. He\u2019s experienced various leadership styles, from the vocal leadership of captain Christian Berger to the quiet, measured leadership of last season\u2019s captain, Simon Mack.</p>\n                <p>But Dowiak brings something different. Because, as Luabach explained, Dowiak leads by example.</p>\n                <p>Picture this. Penn State just lost 7-1 on its home ice to then-No. 2 Michigan \u2014 a demoralizing defeat that marked the team\u2019s third consecutive loss. Its players were defeated and discouraged. Most importantly, they were embarrassed by their poor effort against a Big Ten rival.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions sat silent at their lockers, awaiting a possible message from Gadowsky. But their coach never showed. He knew his captain\u2019s words would hold more weight. He knew Dowiak would speak because his competitiveness wouldn\u2019t stand another effort like the one seen that Friday night inside Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>And, as Laubach said, when Dowiak spoke, everyone listened.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Dane\u2019s) words go a long way with how he plays and how he holds himself,\u201d freshman defenseman Nolan Collins said. \u201cHe plays hard for us. He blocks shots for us. He throws his body around. So it's easy to follow a guy like that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dowiak\u2019s words did hold weight. The junior forward assisted Laubach\u2019s game-winning goal as Penn State defeated Michigan 4-2 the next night.</p>\n                <p>It was an example of Dowiak\u2019s leadership style, one that rubbed off on his teammates to earn an upset win. And while that style resonated that night, his leadership extends beyond hustle plays and blocked shots.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore goaltender Kevin Reidler called Dowiak an \u201cawesome leader\u201d because of his positivity on and off the ice. Sophomore defenseman Nick Fascia said it\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d to play for someone like Dowiak, who himself does everything he asks of others.</p>\n                <p>Halfway through Dowiak\u2019s first season as captain, the Nittany Lions are rolling. They\u2019re 16-6 and ranked No. 8 in the latest USCHO poll.</p>\n                <p>There are many reasons for Penn State\u2019s hot start. The additions of top NHL draft prospects Gavin McKenna and 2025 first-round pick Jackson Smith have certainly helped. As has standout play from its goaltending tandem of Reidler and Josh Fleming.</p>\n                <p>But, as Dowiak\u2019s teammates would tell you, his leadership has topped everything.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDane is a Trojan. He's our captain,\u201d freshman forward Shea Van Olm said. \u201cWe look up to him, we want him to lead, and he knows, being in the position he's in, he's got to lead by example.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>This past week, Penn State headlined the Big Ten wrestling slate with a dominant performance against the Iowa Hawkeyes. While that was Friday\u2019s primetime bout, the rest of the conference had a noteworthy week.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what happened in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Iowa makes roster change</p>\n                <p>Before diving into the results on the mat, the top story of the week dropped out of Iowa City last Tuesday. During his weekly media availability, Iowa coach Tom Brands told reporters that then No. 4 197-pound wrestler Massoma Endene was no longer with the program.</p>\n                <p>Endene had been out with an injury and stepped away from the team temporarily following the birth of his first child last week, prior to the announcement. Freshman Harvey Ludington took Endene\u2019s spot in the lineup against the Nittany Lions and is expected to keep the role moving forward.</p>\n                <p>Friday night lights</p>\n                <p>The second match of Big Ten Network\u2019s Friday night doubleheader was a bout between Nebraska and Minnesota, that saw nine matches decided via decision.</p>\n                <p>Despite scoring 21 points, Nebraska was credited with a 20-12 victory over the Golden Gophers after No. 4 heavyweight AJ Ferrari was assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct deduction for his celebration after defeating Koy Hopke in sudden victory.</p>\n                <p>Other noteworthy results from the dual include No. 10 Vance Vombaur\u2019s decision victory over Jake Hockaday at 141-pounds, No. 5 Antrell Taylor pinning No. 19 Charlie Millard at 157-pounds and No. 3 Max McEnelly needing a sudden victory period to outlast No. 9 Silas Allred at 184-pounds.</p>\n                <p>Elsewhere in the conference, Purdue took down Maryland 28-11 on the road despite missing two key contributors in Joey Blaze and Greyson Clark. The key victory came when No. 22 Ben Vanadia took out No. 15 Branson John via major decision at 197-pounds.</p>\n                <p>The evening also saw Michigan defeat Rutgers, Illinois defeat Michigan State and Wisconsin hand Northwestern their first loss of the season.</p>\n                <p>Sunday matinee slate</p>\n                <p>Three other Big Ten duals occurred on Sunday afternoon, which included Penn State sweeping Northwestern. The Nittany Lions\u2019 52-point margin of victory accounted for the conferences\u2019 largest of the season.</p>\n                <p>Maryland fell to 0-4 in the conference after a 26-12 loss to Penn State\u2019s other upcoming opponent, Indiana. Despite the team loss John bounced back in the highest-ranked match on the card, upsetting No. 14 Gabe Sollars, 4-3.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers stomped Purdue 24-9 in Piscataway, New Jersey, behind victories in four-ranked matches. With the dual starting at 197, Remy Cotton and heavyweight No. 20 Hunter Catka set the tone with back-to-back major decisions. Despite the loss, Purdue had some standout performances, including Ashton Jackson taking No. 27 Ayden Smith to sudden victory at 125 pounds and Brody Baumann shocking No. 10 Lenny Pinto at 174.</p>\n                <p>Finally, Michigan outlasted Illinois in the closest dual of the weekend, 18-14. The standout result from Ann Arbor was Illinois\u2019 184-pounder No. 32 Chris Moore scoring a decision over No. 8 Brock Mantanona.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you\u2019re anything like me, growing up, your parents regaled you with stories from their college days, usually concerning their collegiate escapades, but with some cultural flair as well.</p>\n                <p>For example, my dad, a graduate of the University of Michigan (sigh), barring all of his Greek life adventures (he was a pledge master in the \u201880s \u2014 do with that what you will), most often told me about the \u201cM\u201d in the Diag quad.</p>\n                <p>If you stepped on this infamous letter, it was said you wouldn\u2019t pass your next exam unless you ran about a half mile to a nearby clock tower in ten seconds or less.</p>\n                <p>Though seemingly just a silly tradition, this 70-plus-year-old lore has stood the test of time, but if you mentioned the bronze \u201cM\u201d to anyone who hasn\u2019t gone to UMich or heard stories from someone who did, it would make no sense to them.</p>\n                <p>Just as we here at PSU use words and phrases like \u201cTHON,\u201d \u201cState Patty\u2019s,\u201d and \u201ctownies\u201d that would mean virtually nothing to the average Joe Schmoe around the block, every campus has its own unique culture.</p>\n                <p>We\u2019re connected here by much more than simple accidental proximity. We\u2019re connected by tradition, by culture, by vocabulary, and even by brands.</p>\n                <p>We all know that Crown Russe will put the fear of G-d into anyone who\u2019s ever tasted it before, but outside of PA, I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s even heard of it, let alone drank it. And every college has its own brand of disgusting and disgustingly cheap vodka used at every frat party.</p>\n                <p>We even have our own cultural rites of passage. Yes, everyone across America celebrates their 21st birthday as it symbolizes something special. But at Penn State, it would be a crime if you didn\u2019t celebrate it at The Phyrst with the green, plastic top hat and a shot of a more explicit nature.</p>\n                <p>Food is a similarly strong indicator of a unique cultural space. We all know that D.P. Dough is the greatest drunk food of all time, but would probably be revolting to consume in sobriety. Similarly, El Jefe\u2019s is best consumed after a night out. And The Tavern is a great spot for when your daddy\u2019s in town, footing the bill.</p>\n                <p>And although I\u2019m a bit of a luddite with a rather lackluster grasp on pop culture these days, even I know we have our very own campus celebrities. Before she graduated, Katie Feeney was a constant presence in the PSU football world, and her successor, Megan Million, is relatively well known in the Dunkin\u2019 and social media world.</p>\n                <p>I often think about, as a senior, what I\u2019ll remember after I graduate, and especially, what I\u2019ll remember well enough to tell my own children about.</p>\n                <p>I think about our singing \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d at every football game; about the Willard preacher in his classic red sweatshirt; about the daunting feeling of stepping into Thomas 100 or Forum 102 for the first time. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n                <p>None of these things are official, and none of them are school-sanctioned, but this is what we remember most about our experiences here.</p>\n                <p>Each and every university is its own micro-culture, its own small study of anthropology.</p>\n                <p>What will you remember?</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Two suitcases in hand, a twenty-pound backpack weighing me down and a Lululemon fanny pack slung around my chest, I wove past the Spaniards in the Barcelona streets.</p>\n                <p>Even after a 12-hour trip, consisting of a quick layover in Dublin, Ireland, my body was spent and my mind blown once I arrived in Barcelona, Spain. But I was still able to run laps around the locals. My back ached, and all I wanted was a nap, but it didn\u2019t stop me from being one of the faster walkers on the street.</p>\n                <p>Hands held relaxed behind their back, or a cup of coffee and a cigarette in hand, the Spaniards walked at a 60-minute mile pace, as if they had no care in the world or no destination to trek toward. It was no surprise they gave this American girl a widened side glance when I rushed (walked) past them and to my apartment.</p>\n                <p>I researched Barcelona before applying and arriving, of course, but nothing could have prepared me for the languid pace the Spaniards use throughout life, and not just when they\u2019re blocking the five-meter-wide sidewalks.</p>\n                <p>The days are longer, and meals take place later. The nights are more lively and last until the sun rises. The people in Barcelona enjoy their lives; they take the time to savor and live out each second, minute and hour.</p>\n                <p>Cafes will open from sunrise to sunset, filled with young scholars to old shopkeepers, staying for hours at a time doing work or reading a book with a cup of coffee and a side of a smoking cigarette.</p>\n                <p>Then from 2-5 p.m., it\u2019s like the city takes a nap, more formally known as a siesta, or what I call the best thing to ever exist. Locals close up their shops in the quiet neighborhoods, taking a moment to spend time with their family, nap, run errands or take a stroll through the park.</p>\n                <p>As a constantly busy and nervous wreck college student, the sudden change was like a soft embrace that lasted forever. My life was filled with constant rushing, leaving me with no time to breathe, but now I can truly take a pause and exhale.</p>\n                <p>Unlike at Penn State, where we pack our days with classes, quick meals, club activities and maybe a night out, I have endless hours to do all that I need. Never before in my college career have I taken the time to stroll around for an hour and sit at a cafe for another. My day has expanded, and I found myself quickly relaxing into this lifestyle that moves at a slower pace.</p>\n                <p>However, it\u2019s been less than two weeks since I arrived, and I can\u2019t help but occasionally rush through the slow crowds to my class, which I\u2019m already late for, or how twice already I found a rare restaurant open at 6 p.m. to have dinner and have a snack for \u201cdinnertime\u201d instead.</p>\n                <p>On another note, it\u2019s been less than two weeks, and I already find myself evolving and fitting into the Spanish lifestyle. My body grows tired at 3 p.m. and is more awake at 11 p.m.</p>\n                <p>I like exploring the city at a snail\u2019s pace, sitting at cafes, reading and getting ahead in my assignments. I like waking early to start the day and having a pause in the middle of it to recover. I love the nightlife that bustles until morning, then repeats all over again.</p>\n                <p>While I first hated waiting until the dead of night for a cheap taco shop to open, or taking a long nap before my 2:15 p.m. class after coming home from the clubs at 5 a.m. I now find myself easily falling into this bizarre and perfect routine.</p>\n                <p>MORE ABROAD COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>To call Penn State a dynasty would be an understatement.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have won 12 of the last 14 national championships, and have won four-straight national titles three different times.</p>\n                <p>In the NIL era, other teams have the opportunity to close the gap. Iowa and Oklahoma State are the two most storied programs across NCAA wrestling history. If given substantial funding, those programs are expected to take a jump and compete against the Nittany Lions. However, that has yet to happen, with Iowa most recently falling to Penn State 32-3.</p>\n                <p>The commanding win for the Nittany Lions over the Hawkeyes, one of the most historically dominant teams in the sport, showcases that Penn State is in a different lane than everyone else.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is coming off a season where it broke many records, including the points record in the NCAA championship and having all 10 wrestlers earn All-American status.</p>\n                <p>Iowa has seemingly dropped in competitiveness compared to Penn State. Whether that\u2019s because the Nittany Lions continue to improve or the Hawkeyes\u2019 wrestlers have dropped in talent level is yet to be determined.</p>\n                <p>The domination from Penn State on Friday raises concern for the state of the Iowa program. It has many people asking if the Hawkeyes have fallen off after one of the most lopsided duals in Iowa-Penn State history.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think that we have the right guys to do the job,\u201d Iowa coach Tom Brands said post match. \u201cThere is a gap between Iowa and Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That gap hasn\u2019t been close since Iowa\u2019s defeat of the Nittany Lions on Jan. 31, 2020, the last time Penn State lost a dual meet to any team.</p>\n                <p>On paper, Iowa has top wrestlers in their program, which included matches at 184 and 285 being weight classes the Hawkeyes could win.</p>\n                <p>Yet it didn\u2019t happen, as the Hawkeyes had No. 1 Angelo Ferrari lose to No. 4 Rocco Welsh. Welsh wrestled to his style, defeating him 2-1 in an intense, yet stall-heavy tiebreaker at 184. At heavyweight, No. 13 Cole Mirasola took down No. 5 Ben Kueter in a close battle, too.</p>\n                <p>Two of Iowa\u2019s top wrestlers failed to step up on the biggest stage of the regular season. It was something that was also notable at last year\u2019s NCAA Championships when its transfer portal additions in highly touted Jacori Teemer failed to place, or earn any points for the Hawkeyes.</p>\n                <p>Iowa has had 34 straight years with a national finalist, which could come to an end this season. And if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll likely come from Ferrari who\u2019s notoriously scored few points, leading to few points earned for the overall team score.</p>\n                <p>The Hawkeyes\u2019 major run came in the 1990s under legendary coaches Dan Gable and Jim Zalesky.

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Big Ten basketball season swung into full tilt, as the conference teams approached the midpoints of their seasons.</p>\n                <p>The hierarchical order of teams starts to emerge at this point, and with it, schools are breaking and meeting expectations. This factor reinforces the need to reflect, especially on the Big Ten media poll at the start of the year, as some of its rankings seem laughable at the midseason.</p>\n                <p>The last week of play inside the conference only strengthens that narrative.</p>\n                <p>Boilermaker brilliance, Cornhusker continuation</p>\n                <p>In the preseason poll, there stood one team as a favorite above them all \u2014 Purdue. After this past week of play, the placement is justified. The Boilermakers squeaked out two close wins on the road over Iowa and USC, both middle-of-the-pack teams with strong home records, however.</p>\n                <p>Leading Purdue, as always, is a stout big man, this time in the form of Oscar Cluff, and he\u2019s posted efficient outings, such as a 19 point outing against USC, yet he\u2019s played second fiddle.</p>\n                <p>The leading story out of West Lafayette is Braden Smith, who, in his fourth year with Purdue, played his best basketball so far in his career, as he stands on pace to challenge Bobby Hurley\u2019s all-time career assists mark.</p>\n                <p>Against USC and Iowa, Smith led the Boilermakers in scoring, as the NCAA\u2019s best passer opted to lead with his jumper, yet also posted 13 assists over the two games.</p>\n                <p>The other team atop the conference, Nebraska, didn\u2019t get that initial buzz predicted as preseason predictions had it finishing in the bottom five of the conference. Over the past week of play, it defeated Oregon 90-55 and Northwestern 77-58, rising to 18-0. Evan Miyakawa ranks the Cornhuskers as the 12th-best team in the nation and tabs it as a hot team at the moment.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern, Penn State sink to the bottom</p>\n                <p>While those two teams skyrocketed to the top amid mixed expectations, a pair of teams sank like an anchor to the bottom of the Big Ten once conference play started.</p>\n                <p>The media picked Penn State to finish at the bottom of the conference, while it picked Northwestern just slightly below Nebraska at fourth from the bottom. Both big cat schools sit winless in the conference and have lost their last five games.</p>\n                <p>Both suffered 11 point losses to UCLA and No.11 Illinois on Jan. 14, respectively. Nebraska crushed the Wildcats, while Maryland destroyed Penn State; both squads had little to boast about this season, and last week embodied that sentiment perfectly.</p>\n                <p>The two teams face each other soon, on Jan 29, and it\u2019ll be a battle to avoid the bottom.</p>\n                <p>Middle of the pack moments</p>\n                <p>Between those top of the conference juggernauts and those Big Ten bottom dwellers, there remain 14 teams all vying to differentiate themselves from the pack, and after the past week of play, some squads attempted that.</p>\n                <p>Those attempts span both on and off the court. A team like Ohio State, which sits seventh, added a sixth-year former Nittany Lions forward, Puff Johnson, hoping to boost its squad midseason, although it triumphed over UCLA without him this past week, who stands one spot below the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>Indiana and Iowa occupy the next two spots below them in the standings and faced each other last week. Iowa pulled out a 17 point victory, which tied it with Indiana at 3-4 in the conference, although the Hawkeyes appear prepared to make a leapfrog.</p>\n                <p>The next week of play inside the Big Ten has the majority of the middle-of-the-pack teams scheduled to face each other; Minnesota faces Ohio State, Rutgers heads to Iowa City to face the Hawkeyes, and the rest of the top five conference teams, behind Purdue and Nebraska. Michigan State and Illinois are set to face lower-half conference teams in Maryland and Oregon.</p>\n                <p>The matchup to watch around the Big Ten this next week is Michigan against Indiana. Michigan routinely has been tested this season and Indiana has the quality to mount an upset, despite its crushing loss to the Hawkeyes in the past week.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Another week down, another slew of Big Ten games for women\u2019s basketball.</p>\n                <p>While the games were more predictable this week, there were still several big moments from Week 11 of the 2025-26 season.</p>\n                <p>USC earns 1st win since December</p>\n                <p>In the wake of JuJu Watkins\u2019 absence following an ACL tear in the second round of last year\u2019s NCAA tournament, USC hasn\u2019t been the same.</p>\n                <p>After starting the season 10-3, the Trojans have lost the following four games, including a pair against unranked Oregon and Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>USC flipped the script on Sunday as it earned its first win of 2026, defeating Purdue 83-57. Its last win came on Dec. 29 in an eight-point game against Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>It was another quiet game from Jazzy Davidson, who scored just 13 points on 4-for-12 shooting. Senior Kara Dunn did the heavy lifting, scoring 29 points with four triples.</p>\n                <p>The Trojans sat near the bottom of the Big Ten with just two conference wins, compared to their six wins at this time last year. Now, they\u2019re tied for 10th in the conference with easier games against Rutgers and Northwestern on the horizon.</p>\n                <p>Indiana, Penn State remain winless in Big Ten</p>\n                <p>After Rutgers earned its first conference win over Penn State on Sunday, just two teams remain winless in conference play: Indiana and Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Indiana came into the week on a five-game losing streak, and that was extended as it fell to Washington 82-63.</p>\n                <p>Former Lady Lion Shay Ciezki continued to lead the conference in scoring as she put up another 23 points on Wednesday, shooting 7-for-11 from deep.</p>\n                <p>However, the rest of the team wasn\u2019t able to push the Hoosiers to the win column, with just freshman Maya Makalusky scoring 16 points and five other players combining for 24 points.</p>\n                <p>Likewise, the Lady Lions saw success from Gracie Merkle and Kiyomi McMiller against Rutgers, but couldn\u2019t come out victorious.</p>\n                <p>The two combined for 48 points, but the Scarlet Knights had five players in double figures, including Nene Ndiaye, who led the way with 20 points.</p>\n                <p>UCLA continues Big Ten dominance</p>\n                <p>After upsetting top-seeded USC in the Big Ten championship game last year, UCLA has been on a roll ever since.</p>\n                <p>That continued to be the case last week as the Bruins won two more games to move to 17-1 on the year \u2014 the best record in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>UCLA started the week off with an 18 point win against Minnesota, followed by a 30 point win against No. 12 Maryland.</p>\n                <p>On Wednesday\u2019s game, UCLA star Kiki Rice led the way with 25 points, shooting an almost perfect 8-for-9. However, she was held quiet in Sunday\u2019s big win with just eight points.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, the team\u2019s supporting cast stepped up in a big way against Maryland, with Gabriela Jaquez, Charlisse Leger-Walker and Gianna Kneepkens combining for 55 points.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Alex Fischer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Students gathered in the HUB-Robeson Center Monday afternoon to celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s legacy with an annual Day of Service. Hosted by the Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration Student Committee, the theme for this year\u2019s MLK Day celebrations is \u201cUndaunted Hope.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The MLK Day of Service is part of a nationwide movement started in 1994 to turn a federal holiday \u2014 a day \u201coff\u201d \u2014 into a day of community service \u2014 a day \u201con.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The event began with breakfast, followed by a keynote speech from Smeal College of Business Associate Dean Jamie Campbell and a video about the life and legacy of King.</p>\n                <p>Attendees then dispersed into volunteer groups to work with non-profit organizations from Centre County, including Centre Safe, the Jana Marie Foundation, the Youth Service Bureau and the Institute for Promoting Health, Education, Art and Technology (iPHET).</p>\n                <p>Maya Mathes, a member of the MLK Commemoration Student Committee\u2019s planning committee, was thrilled to see about 600 people in Alumni Hall at the start of the day.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI just hope that people get a lot of fulfillment out of this,\u201d Mathes, a third-year studying food science, said. \u201c(Waking) up early in the morning, on a snowy day with 22 degree weather, no school \u2026 I\u2019m just happy that a lot of people just want to give back to our community.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mathes said her mom raised her to always give back to the community.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just always been a core part of who I am as a person,\u201d Mathes said. \u201cAnd I feel like just being able to give back to Centre County, where I\u2019ve been a resident for three years now, I feel like it\u2019s a really nice way for me to just show my appreciation to everybody around me.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Patrick Williams, the outreach director for the MLK Commemoration Committee, said his favorite part of the day was going from room to room, checking in with each volunteer group and seeing everyone talking to each other.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEverybody is just spreading love because that\u2019s what MLK wanted,\u201d Williams, a fourth-year studying telecommunications and media industries, said. \u201cYou get people from diverse backgrounds just spreading awareness, spreading love, everybody coming together.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ezekiel Hernandez spent the afternoon helping the Youth Services Bureau package diapers with members of his fraternity, Sigma Lambda Beta.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s been happening all across the United States and across the world,\u201d Hernandez, a third-year studying computational data science, said. \u201cI\u2019m Latino, (and) there\u2019s been a lot of different things with ICE, with Venezuela, just so many different things that are happening right now \u2026 but there\u2019s still a lot of people that are in need of help, and we just need to keep pushing forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Valeria Herrera attended the event with her roommate.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI actually transferred from a community college this semester, so this is all very new,\u201d Herrera, a third-year studying global and international studies, said. \u201cI wanted to get more involved on campus and just help out as much as I can.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Herrera worked on making \u201cJared Boxes\u201d for the Jared Box Project, which are plastic, shoe-sized boxes filled with gifts, games and toys which are given to children in hospitals all over the country.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s so much fun to just envision a little kid receiving a box, and then just lighting up (with) excitement,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI just want to make positive impacts in (these) little kids\u2019 lives, because they\u2019re just in hospitals all day, every day, and I feel like their days could definitely be really gloomy \u2026 I want to make them happy and make their childhood as normal as possible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kadyn Young was at the Day of Service with members of her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, making first-aid kids for iPHET.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWith everything going on in the world, we could all use a bit more love, we could all use a bit more unity,\u201d Young, a second-year studying finance, said. \u201cSo, I feel like that\u2019s a great way to honor him, (by) helping others and giving back to our community \u2026 (MLK Day) is not just a day off, it\u2019s a day of doing something to honor his legacy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Paris Stafford, co-director of the MLK Commemoration Committee, said it\u2019s important to not forget MLK\u2019s legacy.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo one wants to repeat history,\u201d Stafford, a third-year studying economics, said. \u201cSo really just, keeping all our generations, future generations informed of what MLK did.\u201d</p>\n                <p>King is also the reason Stafford went into economics, as King had written a book about the connection between systemic poverty and systemic racism.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe wanted everyone to be equitable and everyone to be equal,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cI really thought that was just phenomenal. And using that type of mindset, it really got me into economics and wanting to kind of close that generational wage gap.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As volunteers came back together in Alumni Hall at the end of the event, they were asked to sign a large \u201cMLK 2026\u201d poster on their way in. The prompt was: \u201cWhat hope do you want to create?\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cMLK has definitely been a big part of my life,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cAnd so, really, just seeing this opportunity to do service in my community is just phenomenal.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 Guard Kayden Mingo was on the court warming up ahead of Penn State\u2019s game against Maryland on Sunday. He was listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d before the game due to his nose injury.</p>\n                <p>Mingo then made his return to action by slotting back into the starting lineup and dropping 19 points, five assists, three rebounds and a steal despite a 96-73 loss to the Terrapins. He wore a face mask during the game and explained what it was like playing in his first game back.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI felt comfortable,\u201d Mingo said postgame. \u201cIt was an adjustment at first and practice and stuff, and now I feel good with it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo spoke to reporters during a press conference on Jan. 5, and there wasn\u2019t an indication he was dealing with any injuries at that moment. However, during a practice later that day, Mingo suffered a broken nose, which forced him to miss the Michigan game on Jan. 6, and he didn\u2019t even appear on the sideline for the matchup.</p>\n                <p>The freshman remained listed as \u201cout\u201d for the Purdue game on Jan. 10, but Mike Rhoades provided more clarity on the situation postgame, saying Mingo\u2019s surgery \u201cwent well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo stayed under the \u201cout\u201d section of the availability report for the UCLA game last week, but he made a public appearance and sat on the sideline for the contest.</p>\n                <p>Sunday marked the first time Mingo warmed up ahead of a matchup since suffering the injury, and he didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d be sidelined for a long time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI didn't think (my absence) would be too long,\u201d Mingo said. \u201cI know I'm around a lot of great people who can help me and get me back fast, so I didn't stress on it too much. I just wished my teammates good luck as they went into the next couple games.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo kicked off the game with a corner three, as Penn State grabbed an early lead. Through the first five minutes, Mingo had seven points on 100% shooting, keeping the Nittany Lions within range of Maryland\u2019s 16-13 advantage.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins began to run away with the game in the first half, leading 56-26 at halftime, but Mingo helped Penn State stay in the game. Coming out of the second half, the Nittany Lions cut the lead down to 10 points behind multiple plays by Mingo.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought his timing was off a little bit at times, but he battled, especially in the second half when we made that run,\u201d Rhoades said postgame. \u201cI thought he really got downhill, was pushing the ball, got us into stuff and all that. So our trainer did a great job with him, helping him get back. Doctors did a great job to get him back. You just got to get now, in the flow of it, and the feel of it, all that stuff. He was out for a while, but he's a hard rock and dude, he's a tough kid.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo averages 15.2 points, 3.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2.4 steals per game throughout 15 appearances this season. He shot 58.3% from the field and 40% from 3-point range against the Terrapins, improving his season shooting marks to 49.2% from the field and 25% from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>It was more than just a return for Mingo as he seemed his usual self at times throughout the game against Maryland. He credited Penn State\u2019s training staff for its efforts.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur trainer, Justin (Pomar), had a good plan in place,\u201d Mingo said. \u201cWe took it day by day, and every day was a step closer to getting back in the process. Give all thanks to Justin and everybody who helped me.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | Authentically inauthentic: Music\u2019s evolution away from sincerity",
    "author": "Emma Strickling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Much like anything, music has evolved and continues to evolve over time. While things like genre popularity have influenced its direction \u2014 the most influential factor is arguably technology.</p>\n                <p>Increased technological capabilities has allowed artists a greater ability to expand the way they create music. While technology is a helpful tool, I think it\u2019s led to less authenticity in music. For example, autotune, which made its way onto the music scene in 1997, has made music less unique and personal</p>\n                <p>Cher\u2019s \u201cBelieve,\u201d one of the more notable songs featuring autotune, used it as a pitch corrector. Its usage meant less time was spent in the studio rerecording vocals, saving the bigwigs of the label money. Today technology can do a myriad of things, such as shape one\u2019s voice manually . Furthermore, its broadened capabilities now make this a staple within the music industry today, with a large majority of artists using autotune on their records.</p>\n                <p>While some argue technology broadens the scope of musical ability, I believe it takes away the opportunity for an authentic sound \u2014 making each singer\u2019s voice a replication of others. All the distinct little quirks within a singer's voice are no longer present, leaving the vocals sounding soulless.</p>\n                <p>So what if the note is a little flat? I want to hear the little imperfections. I want to hear the humanity of natural singing and instrumentation, not something that sounds like it\u2019s coming from a computer.</p>\n                <p>One of my favorite artists is Bob Dylan, and occasionally, when I mention that to people, they normally comment on his singing voice. I know he\u2019s not the best singer ever to exist on this Earth.</p>\n                <p>However, the thing that sets Dylan apart from modern-day singers and one of the reasons I admire him is that he\u2019s not pretending to be some great singer. Even as an 84-year-old man, he\u2019s still performing, now with a gravelly and weathered voice. Some might argue it\u2019s worse than before, but he isn\u2019t covering it up.</p>\n                <p>Not only does excess technology rob music of an authentic sound, the lyrics suffer as well. If it seems like songs today are simpler and more repetitive, it\u2019s because they are. A study from the Scientific American magazine found over the past 50 years songs have adopted longer choruses which is part of the reason everything sounds the same.</p>\n                <p>In a lot of modern music it seems like the chorus takes up half the song, and in some cases it absolutely does.</p>\n                <p>Even songs today credit multiple people writing on them. Popular names like Benson Boone and Sabrina Carpenter have credited at least three people per song on their most recently released album. One would think that by having a variety of perspectives, there would be a greater possibility for more unique lyrics and less repetition. But alas that isn\u2019t the case.</p>\n                <p>Authenticity of voice is especially important for songwriting because it creates a connection between performer and listener. It\u2019s more compelling when you hear a song that comes from a place of true expression and feeling, whereas repetitive writing potentially leaves the listener uninspired and bored. Well, at least it does for me.</p>\n                <p>I think something that gets overlooked today is that songwriting is just as much a method of storytelling as any artistic medium. Take the song \u201cSuite: Judy Blue Eyes\u201d written by Stephen Stills and performed by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. It\u2019s divided up into four sections, true to its name as suite, with each section distinct from the others. Yes, there\u2019s a repeating theme in the first part with the chorus, but it\u2019s not like it occurs during the entire seven minutes of the song.</p>\n                <p>Through his songwriting, Stills reflects on a relationship that\u2019s on the verge of ending. Not only is there strong lyrical writing, but the inclusion of harmonies provided by bandmates David Crosby and Graham Nash really help to create a sound that\u2019s distinct and authentic to their group.</p>\n                <p>To make it clear, I\u2019m not trying to say that music needs to be complex in order to be considered great. Simple songs can be great, too, if they\u2019re done well. What I really mean is that creating music that\u2019s heavily repetitive and dependent upon technology takes away the potential of greatness.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps these artists of today should focus more on their own abilities and not what will be commercially acceptable. If technologies like autotune are a must to today\u2019s artists, then I think they might be in the wrong business.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Against Illinois on Jan. 11, toughness was the key talking point for coach Carolyn Kieger as Penn State fell to 7-11 on the year.</p>\n                <p>Things were no different on Sunday as the Lady Lions fell to Rutgers, marking their eighth-straight loss and continuation of a winless conference record.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt comes down to toughness again,\u201d Kieger said following the Rutgers game. \u201cWe did a great job taking care of the ball tonight, but it still goes back to being tough and finishing the possession.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For a majority of the first three quarters, that toughness was visible as the blue and white were up by three points entering the final period.</p>\n                <p>Despite not being the team\u2019s leading scorer, 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle was a key contributor to that toughness against the Scarlet Knights, constantly being double-teamed down in the paint.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m kind of used to (being double-teamed),\u201d Merkle said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m getting double-teamed, triple-teamed all game, every game. We go to practice, we work on it, and at the end of the day, I just got to go up stronger.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Merkle put up 21 points on Sunday as she went 7-for-11 from the field. However, her strength was most evident with her 10 free throw attempts. While she only made seven of them, her strength was on display as she got to the line five times.</p>\n                <p>On the same side of the ball, freshman Nyla McFadden also exhibited the Lady Lion tenacity in her third career start.</p>\n                <p>While McFadden scored nine points on 4-for-4 shooting, her main takeaway from the game wasn\u2019t her starting spot or perfect shooting, but rather the team\u2019s poor fourth-quarter defense that led to Sunday\u2019s loss.</p>\n                <p>\u201cReally, we just need to be tougher on the defensive end,\u201d McFadden said. \u201cWe just need to when it comes to in-the-game situations if we want to win a big game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Entering the final quarter up three points, the Lady Lions fell to the hands of a 9-2 run from Rutgers, who quickly retook the lead.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Scarlet Knights having just three offensive boards in the first three quarters, they tallied eight in the final period, which proved to be the game-changer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just something that can\u2019t happen,\u201d McFadden said.</p>\n                <p>While Kiyomi McMiller led the team in points, her presence was limited in the early parts of the fourth quarter after picking up her fourth foul with over nine minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>McMiller ultimately returned later in the quarter to finish the day with 27 points. However, hers and Merkle\u2019s performances couldn\u2019t overcome Rutgers\u2019 fourth-quarter advantage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSo until we develop this toughness and this grit to play defense, the results are not gonna change,\u201d Kieger said on Jan. 11 after the Illinois game.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A few weeks after Rutgers star freshman Kiyomi McMiller made the news after being benched due to internal matters, she entered the transfer portal and ultimately committed to Penn State in April.</p>\n                <p>On Sunday, she had a chance to face her former team for the first game, putting on a dominant performance on both sides of the ball despite the Lady Lions falling to 0-8 in conference play.</p>\n                <p>McMiller kept the blue and white alive late in the fourth quarter, tallying nine of the team\u2019s 17 points. However, hers and Gracie Merkle\u2019s efforts alone weren\u2019t enough for the win.</p>\n                <p>The Silver Springs, Maryland, native was silent for the first four minutes of action, but quickly came alive and stayed alive for the rest of the game. McMiller kick-started her game off with her first of many rebounds in the game and took it down the court, weaving back-and-forth through traffic as she stopped for a quick jumpshot.</p>\n                <p>As Rutgers began working the ball back down the court, ultimately missing the basket, the former Scarlet Knight earned her second rebound of the day, and after some back-and-forth ball movement, scored again with a layup.</p>\n                <p>McMiller\u2019s success didn\u2019t just come from her own shots, however. Down by seven points, McMiller found 6-foot-6 Merkle in the paint and dished the ball to her between tight double coverage.</p>\n                <p>After a few baskets from each team, McMiller followed up a four-point play from Viktoria Ranisavljevic with a triple of her own. That toughness continued midway through the second quarter as McMiller fought in the paint for a layup and earned a free throw, putting herself at double-digit scoring on the day.</p>\n                <p>Despite being a huge offensive and defensive asset to the Lady Lions, McMiller had a big impact on the court even when she didn\u2019t have the ball in her hands or guard the ball.</p>\n                <p>Less than one minute into the second half, Merkle and Nyla McFadden made a pair of baskets, giving Penn State its first lead of the game. As McFadden\u2019s shot hit the net, McMiller started clapping her hands and screaming in celebration as she stared over at Coquese Washington, her former coach.</p>\n                <p>Two drives following McMiller\u2019s celebration, the Lady Lions made arguably one of their biggest plays of the game. Freshman T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante picked off the inbound from Rutgers\u2019 Lauryn Swann and passed the ball to Moriah Murray, who crossed over a pair of Rutgers players and found McMiller wide open for a layup.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ultimately lost its lead late in the fourth quarter as the Scarlet Knights got hot, but McMiller was the key difference-maker who kept things close.</p>\n                <p>With just over a minute and a half left in regulation, McMiller drained her second triple of the day to end Rutgers\u2019 8-1 run.</p>\n                <p>Over the next two drives, McMiller made a pair of layups to ultimately cut the lead down to three points, but her efforts weren\u2019t enough for the Lady Lions.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2013 Penn State basketball went to face the Terrapins with the expectation that the Nittany Lions would fight and potentially earn their first Big Ten win against one of the other three teams that were winless in the conference. Yet, the only fight shown stood too little, too late.</p>\n                <p>Maryland endured a tumultuous season to this point, similar to Penn State, and this clash seemed like the season's pinnacle of that trend, as both staggered into the contest at less than full strength.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad entered with two questionable players, its leading scorers Kayden Mingo and Freddie Dilione V, while it listed big man Tibor Mirti\u0107 as out. Both questionable players suited up, with mixed results: Mingo played his usual over 30 minutes, while Dilione\u2019s ankle injury limited him to only 15.</p>\n                <p>Those injury woes didn\u2019t appear early for one squad, as a Maryland unit with three players sidelined cruised to its highest scoring first half in program history, en route to an eventual 96-73 rout.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMaryland came out and just absolutely smacked us in the first 20 minutes,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWith the group we have, the young team we have, we\u2019ve had some tough spells this year of just letting guys get off and get going, and Diggy (Coit) did that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Maryland guard Diggy Coit enacted the onslaught by the Terrapins, to Penn State\u2019s ire, as he flirted with a new program single-game scoring record, ultimately finishing a point shy. The Columbus, New Jersey, native notched 43 points on the day, obviously a career high, behind nine three-pointers, which consistently came off slick handles.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought (Diggy Coit) was going to score 100 points today,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cOur guys are fighting, you saw the second half, I thought the first eight to ten minutes of the second half, our guys battled.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That second-half run that Rhoades references is the only bright spot on a day on which the Nittany Lions fully surrendered to Coit and Maryland. The Nittany Lions came out on a 25-5 run over the first ten minutes of the second half, which pulled them within ten.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis stinks, this sucks, I hate it \u2013 we all hate it,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cNobody is giving us a freebie, this is life in the Big Ten, this is how it is nowadays in this crazy landscape of college athletics when you're trying to build a program \u2026 I\u2019ve done it at other places, some places it may take longer than ever.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That sentiment remains bitter in the mouths of Penn State basketball fans: a program that wants to win, every moment it gets to boost morale immediately gets countered by a blowout loss.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades and Penn State played many different lineups throughout the game, including a new small-ball lineup after Ivan Juri\u0107 picked up foul trouble in the second half. It signals where this team is at: still molding, figuring itself out, and creating its new identity. But Rhoades reflected on that lineup change and how his coaching came into play.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn our league, it\u2019s really hard to do that,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think we were getting enough from the other guys. I thought Josh (Reed) was playing really hard \u2026 they weren\u2019t playing inside-out as much, we could do that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A Maryland team, which struggled with its own adversity and doubts this season, showed why its team, led by Buzz Williams, is destined for greater things and the blueprint for doing so, with a passion and culture that Penn State hoops would expect to envy, as Maryland triumphed over all adversity with its versatility.</p>\n                <p>For Rhoades and Co., it\u2019s clear there is a ceiling they\u2019ve yet to break through, and despite moments of success, every harsh defeat and unprepared outing threatens the very foundation of the program it tries to establish in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s any hits to take, I\u2019ll take the hits; if there's any pointing fingers, point them at me,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cDon't point them at the guys, they're working their butts off \u2013 they wanna win.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 Mike Rhoades had a defeated look on his face as he sat down in the Xfinity Center media room after Penn State\u2019s 96-73 loss to Maryland on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>The result dropped the Nittany Lions to 9-9 on the year, bringing into question if Rhoades can build a basketball program at Penn State. He gave a blunt answer when asked about the current state of the team, saying \u201cthis stinks\u201d and \u201cwe all hate it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf there's any hits to take, I'll take the hits,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIf there's any pointing fingers, point them at me. Don't point them at the guys. They're working their butts off, and they're there. They want to win. They want to get after it. So it is what it is. You got to continue to move forward \u2026 So there's never going to be a day that, if I'm in charge of the program, that we're not going to try to get these guys better and push each other, telling each other the truth, and have each other's back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have seen close losses in conference play throughout this season, such as a 74-72 defeat to No. 2 Michigan or a 76-72 loss to No. 9 Michigan State. But the bottom line is Penn State is winless in Big Ten play, and there\u2019s been games where the team didn\u2019t show much, like Sunday\u2019s game or the 113-72 loss to Indiana.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has 13 games left in the season to pick up its first win in conference play. Despite being 0-7 in Big Ten play, there\u2019s a belief within the program in Rhoades and the Nittany Lions\u2019 chances to rattle off some victories.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThings happen,\u201d guard Kayden Mingo said. \u201cIt\u2019s basketball. There\u2019s two sides to it. You might win some, you\u2019re gonna lose some. And the same way we\u2019re going on a losing streak, I feel like we could turn it around and go on a winning streak, so I got confidence in my teammates and my coaches.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades is in Year 3 of his head coaching tenure at Penn State. While the Nittany Lions finished 16-17 in Rhoades\u2019 first season and 16-15 last year, there were flashes of what Rhoades could build.</p>\n                <p>Notably, Penn State knocked off No. 8 Purdue and No. 12 Wisconsin during the 2024-25 season. Rhoades came to the Nittany Lions after guiding VCU to multiple NCAA Tournament appearances.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI've done it in other places,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSome places may take a little bit longer than others, but get the right kids on board, hold them accountable to a high level, and especially when it's times like this, love them. Coach them hard. Love them harder.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a Big Ten Freshman of the Year contender in Kayden Mingo, among other young players who have flashed talent at times. Furthermore, the Nittany Lions are a finalist for 5-star 2026 guard Dylan Mingo, who plans to announce his college decision Thursday and would help in Rhoades\u2019 efforts in building a program in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Regardless, the Nittany Lions are still 41-41 overall and 15-32 in Big Ten play under Rhoades. Close losses have plagued Penn State, but blowout losses like Sunday won\u2019t help its outlook with Rhoades at the helm.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe've had pockets of good basketball. We've been close in some games,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cYou saw how we played those first eight minutes. We're just not mature enough and tough enough and mentally tough enough, and it starts with me. I got to keep helping these guys to find a way to get over the hump. But there's no excuses. We're not playing good enough basketball to win in the Big Ten, especially on the road.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State entered Sunday against Northwestern coming off a massive 32-3 win on the road against No. 2 Iowa. The Nittany Lions ended their weekend on the same side of the win column and extended their historic consecutive win streak in matches.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took home the victory by a score of 51-0.</p>\n                <p>174 Pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs No. 32 Eddie Enright (NU)</p>\n                <p>The match started at 174 with Levi Haines after he dominated Gabe Arnold against Iowa. The senior continued that momentum in this match against Eddie Enright.</p>\n                <p>Haines recorded the only points in the opening period to grab the 3-0 lead. Haines added two more takedowns in the second period and started to tire out Enright.</p>\n                <p>Haines continued to maintain control on the mat, extending his lead to 16-4, only allowing Enright to gain points by escaping. Haines got the tech fall-victory, 19-4.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 5-0.</p>\n                <p>184 Pounds: No. 4 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs JD Perez (NU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh started on the attack with a takedown in the opening 30 seconds of the match. Welsh continued to build off his momentum after defeating No. 1 Angelo Ferrari against Iowa, as the Ohio State transfer ended the first period on top, 12-5.</p>\n                <p>JD Perez secured the Wildcats first takedown of the match, but Welsh went right to work after, garnering two more takedowns in the second period.</p>\n                <p>Welsh got the tech fall 22-7 and extended Penn State\u2019s lead 10-0.</p>\n                <p>197 Pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs Alex Smith (NU)</p>\n                <p>Since coming back from injury Josh Barr has been on a tear, going undefeated so far this season.</p>\n                <p>Barr was in control for the entire match and pinned Alex Smith with 1:10 left in the first period.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 16-0.</p>\n                <p>285 Pounds: No. 13 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs Gabe Christenson (NU)</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola opened the match with a takedown in the opening 10 seconds and continued to get several takedowns in the first period.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt freshman looked quicker than Gabe Christenson and used that to his advantage.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola got the tech fall with 19 seconds left in the first period 19-4 and extended the lead to 21-0.</p>\n                <p>125 Pounds: No. 2 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs No. 26 Dedrick Navarro (NU)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl and Dedrick Navarro wrestled pretty evenly in the first period with Lilledahl ahead 3-1, but in the second period Lilledahl started to pull away.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl garnered two more takedowns in the middle period to extend his lead to 9-3. Lilledahl was the quicker wrestler and continued to maintain control of the match as it went on.</p>\n                <p>The St. Charles, Missouri, native secured the takedown late with a 20-6 victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 26-0.</p>\n                <p>133 Pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs No. 24 Sean Spidle (NU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze was the only wrestler to secure a takedown, but neither wrestler was able to do much. Sean Spidle displayed solid defense against Blaze and kept it close, 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Blaze earned the only points of the second period, yet Spidle had the biggest chance to earn a takedown. Spidle had Blaze\u2019s leg, but was never able to get the freshman to the ground.</p>\n                <p>Blaze started to take control in the third period with three takedowns to get the major decision, 15-4.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 30-0.</p>\n                <p>141 Pounds: No. 7 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs No. 32 Billy Dekraker (NU)</p>\n                <p>The match started pretty evenly until there was 20 seconds left in the opening period. Braeden Davis got a takedown and four near falls.</p>\n                <p>Billy Dekraker couldn\u2019t find a way to get any points on the board, despite having a few opportunities.</p>\n                <p>Davis got the major decision, 9-0. Penn State leads 34-0.</p>\n                <p>149: Pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs August Hibler (NU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness seemed comfortable the entire match against August Hibler. The junior secured two takedowns and seemed to be on top the entire first period.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness garnered two more takedowns and four near fall points in the middle frame. Van Ness secured the riding time right as the third period began.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 39-0</p>\n                <p>157 Pounds: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs Gunner Myers (NU)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke started the match with a takedown and never took his foot off the pedal. After review, Duke got the takedown erased as he never separated from Gunner Myers.</p>\n                <p>The freshman then secured the pin with 18 seconds left in the first period.</p>\n                <p>165 Pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs Nobody</p>\n                <p>Northwestern forfeited this match.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wins 51-0.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s basketball returned to Rec Hall on Sunday to take on Rutgers for its White Out and THON game. The matchup guaranteed someone their first Big Ten win.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions failed to earn their first Big Ten win, falling 76-72.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to fight and figure out a way to get this team confident and finish out a fourth quarter,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s Gracie Merkle took on Rutgers\u2019 Imani Lester for the opening tip that found T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante to give the Lady Lions first possession.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights got off to a quick start, shooting 4-for-6 from field-goal range to take an early 10-5 lead. However, Merkle got Penn State two points from the foul line, and Kiyomi McMiller nailed back-to-back buckets from inside the paint to give the Lady Lions their first lead of the game against her former team.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers didn\u2019t back down, as the Scarlet Knights went on an 8-0 run to take an 18-11 lead with just under four minutes to play in the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>Both teams kept trading baskets through the final minutes, but Rutgers had the upper hand to end the frame with a 22-17 lead.</p>\n                <p>About a minute in the second quarter, Moriah Murray got the scoring started with a foul-line jumper. It was quickly matched with a layup from Lester on the other end.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers exploded for a 7-0 run to take a 10-point lead with just under seven minutes left in the quarter, but Viktoria Ranisavlijevic picked the Lady Lions up with a four-point play.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wouldn\u2019t let up as a three-pointer from McMiller and a layup from Vit\u00f3ria Santana cut the Scarlet Knights\u2019 lead to 31-28.</p>\n                <p>Down by five, McMiller went at three Rutgers players inside the paint and completed the and-1 to make it a two-point game.</p>\n                <p>Both teams went cold for two minutes, but Santana stripped the ball from Faith Blackstone and was fouled after the play. The senior guard went to the line for two with a chance to tie the game, but missed the first.</p>\n                <p>The foul-shooting woes continued for the Lady Lions as Ranisavlijevic went 1-for-2 from the line to put the blue and white at 6-for-10 on the day and give the Scarlet Knights a 35-33 lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe shot better from the floor, but not the free-throw line and not the three,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI thought that was the big difference today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rutgers had a shot at the buzzer to extend its lead, but Kennedy Brandt\u2019s three-point attempt circled the rim and fell out.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened up the second half, scoring four-straight points to take its first lead since the opening quarter and cause a Rutgers timeout.</p>\n                <p>The timeout didn\u2019t slow the Lady Lions down as two defensive plays from Cl\u00e8ante led to four points on the offensive end.</p>\n                <p>Tied at 45 with five minutes to go in the frame, McMiller found McFadden on a cut to the basket to give the freshman her sixth points of the quarter. Penn State didn\u2019t hold the lead for long as Brandt nailed a three on the other end.</p>\n                <p>Merkle went 1-for-2 from the foul line on the other end to make it a tie contest once again.</p>\n                <p>Penn State held a 52-50 lead with just over a minute to play in the quarter, Merkle fouled Lester to give the Scarlet Knights a chance to even the score. Lester missed both, and a rebound by McMiller found its way to Murray for a three-pointer on the other end.</p>\n                <p>Swann made a jumper in the final seconds for Rutgers, but the Lady Lions held a 55-52 lead heading into the final frame.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights started with the ball, and a quick foul by Maggie Mendelson sent Blackstone to the line, where she made both.</p>\n                <p>After a layup from Merkle, Rutgers scored four-straight points to gain a one-point lead, forcing a Penn State timeout.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights continued a 7-0 scoring run to take a 61-57 lead, but were finally slowed down by consecutive two-pointers from McMiller and Merkle.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe had only given up three offensive rebounds going into the fourth and they ended up with 11,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cSo it comes back down to toughness. We did a great job of taking care of the ball, but it goes back to being tough and finishing the possession.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Both teams traded baskets over the next three minutes. With Rutgers holding onto a 66-64 lead, its leading scorer, Nene Ndiaye, recorded an and-one to make it a five-point game.</p>\n                <p>After a free throw from Merkle and back-to-back layups from Lester, Rutgers held a 73-65 lead with just over two minutes left to play.</p>\n                <p>With about 34 seconds left, the Scarlet Knights led 75-70 and had possession under their own basket. Following a shot-clock violation, the Lady Lions had 25 seconds to score two baskets.</p>\n                <p>McMiller drove to the basket for two points and only five seconds ticked off the clock. Coming out of a timeout, Shaelyn Steele fouled Ivey before Rutgers could inbound the ball. Ivey missed the first and made the second, making the score 76-72 with 20.7 seconds left.</p>\n                <p>Murray and Cl\u00e8ante both got three-point looks for the Lady Lions, but it wasn\u2019t enough as time ticked away.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Amiya Evans was listed as out for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions will start their West Coast trip with a contest against Washington at 9 p.m. Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

The Nittany Lions remain winless in conference play after suffering an embarrassing 96-73 loss to Maryland.</p>\n                <p>To kick things off at the XFINITY Center, Ivan Juri\u0107 won the opening tipoff, which led to a Kayden Mingo three-pointer. Despite sporting a mask around his eyes and nose, Mingo\u2019s vision didn\u2019t look restricted at all in the early running.</p>\n                <p>David \u201cDiggy\u201d Coit, coming off a 30 point performance against USC, was up to 11 points within the first four minutes of the game after knocking down two three-pointers that pushed Maryland ahead to a 16-13 lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen good players get going early in the game, they have career nights,\u201d Mike Rhoades said about Coit. \u201cWe let him get going early. Good players, they get going early, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Another look from downtown, this time from Freddie Dilione V, tightened the gap for Penn State as it cut the deficit to 21-18 with 13 minutes left in the first half.</p>\n                <p>The long-ball had been the story of the game, still in the early stages, as Maryland\u2019s Elijah Saunders knocked one down to make it an eight-point game. It was his second of the day, while Coit was 3-3 from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins seized a 33-21 lead on a Darius Adams drive that forced the blue and white to use a timeout in an effort to regroup after facing its first substantial deficit.</p>\n                <p>It was all Maryland with just five minutes to play in the first half when the Terrapins extended their lead to 18 points after yet another three-pointer, this time from Isaiah Watts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State had no answer to the volume shooting, as it was draining just 25% of its three-pointers while the Terrapins were knocking down 67%.</p>\n                <p>With the game slowly slipping away from them, a visibly frustrated Mike Rhoades and the Nittany Lions took to the locker room at halftime, facing a hefty 56-26 disadvantage \u2013 The most points Maryland has ever scored in the first half of a Big Ten game.</p>\n                <p>Coit put up 30 points against the Trojans his last time out, but reached that mark in the first half alone after going 6-8 from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened up the scoring in the second half, though, with a Dominick Stewart three-pointer that was really just for pride at that point, as the Terrapins immediately responded.</p>\n                <p>At the first media timeout of the second half, around the 16-minute mark, Maryland was out-rebounding Penn State 27-13, with Mingo leading the blue and white with three boards.</p>\n                <p>A Josh Reed steal and score cut the lead to 60-46, but there wasn\u2019t a ton of belief in the XFINITY Center that his basket would turn it around for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe knew that we were going to go on a run, and that\u2019s what we did,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe tried to maintain it, but stuff happens; they made shots. But, coming out the second half with a lot of energy, we know that\u2019s how we have to play from here on out.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Another Stewart triple gave him 13 points on the day and made it a 12 point game, but there was a lot more work to do with just over 11 minutes left to play.</p>\n                <p>After being down 30 points at the half, the Nittany Lions worked it back down to just a 10 point game, only for the Terrapins to silence them and grab a 19 point lead thanks to scoring efforts from Saunders and Solomon Washington.</p>\n                <p>The two teams traded scores the next few possessions, with Eli Rice hitting a three-pointer of his own and Coit notching his 35th point of the game as Maryland went up 79-58.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHey, you suck\u201d chants rang out from inside the XFINITY Center after the Terrapins pushed their lead to 25 points with just about four minutes remaining, thanks to another Coit three-pointer, which gave him 43 on the day \u2013 a new career-high.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some tough spells this year of just letting some guys get off and get going, and David did that,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI thought he was going to score 100 points today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Some more scoring came here and there, but Maryland mostly played keep-away as time drained down and captured a 96-73 victory.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s standout freshman Kayden Mingo was listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d while recovering from a broken nose. However, Mingo was back in the starting lineup, but with a mask around his eyes and nose.</p>\n                <p>Freddie Dilione V was also listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d with an ankle injury, but played, though less than usual.</p>\n                <p>Tibor Mirti\u010d was again sidelined with a knee injury. Mirti\u010d will \u201cbe out for a little bit\u201d as his knee is \u201cjust rehabbing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions look to snap their five-game losing streak when they host Wisconsin on Thursday for the annual \u201cReturn to Rec\u201d game inside Penn State\u2019s historic Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>Scheduled tipoff is set for 7 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>On Friday and Saturday, the Penn State College Republicans hosted its third annual Pennsylvania Collegiate Leadership Conference in the HUB-Robeson Center.</p>\n                <p>Throughout the conference, the Penn State College Republicans offered a variety of speakers, including elected officials, Turning Point USA members, students and other political activists, part of efforts to introduce conservative principles throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Hunter Steach, the Penn State College Republicans\u2019 vice president, said the goals of the conference were civic engagement and creating a safe place for those with conservative and liberal ideologies alike to attend.</p>\n                <p>Steach said he wanted to allow attendees to meet with speakers, such as Glenn Thompson and Stacy Garrity, to gain insight into conservative perspectives.</p>\n                <p>Mia Humphreys, the Penn State College Republicans\u2019 director of special events, said the event offered community building for conservatives to portray their ideas, goals and values.</p>\n                <p>In Glenn Thompson\u2019s speech, he said principles and values define each person. He offered insight into his values as a Congressman by offering advice to potential future political leaders.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAlways try to listen twice as much as you speak \u2014 that's a true leader,\u201d Thompson said.</p>\n                <p>Brooke Phillips, a former member of the Penn State College Republicans, said that by listening and working together, real understanding and progress can happen.</p>\n                <p>\u201cConservative principles support open discussion and civil discourse,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t avoid these difficult conversations.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Throughout the conference, the Penn State College Republicans and their speakers presented conservative perspectives on various political topics. Ideas on how to combat issues \u2014 such as defending the republic by exploring ways to counter immigration flaws and a debate over U.S. policy regarding Venezuela to gain attendees' perspectives \u2014 were also presented.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEach side should be given the opportunity to express their views calmly, without attacking, while seeking common ground and shared goals,\u201d Phillips said.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Phillips, a Penn State alumna, said she values learning from other people and believes disagreement doesn\u2019t have to prevent cooperation.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people in my time here, from [a range] of political ideologies that feel afraid to share their beliefs,\u201d Steach, a fourth-year studying political science, said. \u201cThis conference enables people who have a dream in politics or not politics, and something in this realm, [to] chase them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Humphreys said the topics were intended to rally people together and enhance perspectives by standing up for beliefs and allowing attendees to speak their truth.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to continue free speech and free narrative on college campuses today,\u201d Humphreys, a second-year studying political science, said.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ranked 228 in a College Pulse Free Speech ranking in 2024 and again in 2025. The ranking detailed students\u2019 comfort expressing their ideas, as well as their tolerance for liberal and conservative speakers.</p>\n                <p>Despite the ranking, Penn State is considered to have a balanced ratio among conservative and liberal students.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe climate here is great,\u201d Humphreys said. \u201cWe have a great relationship with the College Dems. We work together. We do our 9/11 event together. Overall, Penn State does a better job of allowing all of us to have a voice compared to other college stories we may have heard of.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Steach said he always felt safe and respected at Penn State regarding his political beliefs and affiliation.</p>\n                <p>The growth of the College Republicans has gone from roughly three chapters to twenty-plus chapters connecting over the past three years, according to Steach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of college students sometimes aren\u2019t politically engaged at all,\u201d Humphreys said. \u201cThey don\u2019t go to the polls and vote, and that\u2019s ultimately what\u2019s most important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said the conference was meant to spread the word regarding conservative thought and get attendees involved to become more politically active.</p>\n                <p>Steach said he wanted people to feel more confident and comfortable sharing their beliefs after attending the conference.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe are a diverse community here at Penn State,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cExposure to differing perspectives allows students to form their own opinions and develop skills to engage respectfully.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Heritage Hall came alive with music and dance Saturday evening as the African Students Association (ASA) held its 13th annual Mr. and Miss Africa pageant in the HUB-Robeson Center.</p>\n                <p>The pageant, themed \u201cCrowned in Heritage,\u201d saw five contestants \u201cembody the beauty, strength and elegance\u201d of their respective countries. Each contestant integrated elements of their culture within their entrance into Heritage Hall and during events later into the night that were observed by a panel of four judges.</p>\n                <p>The contestants also presented an issue within their country they felt a personal connection to, as well as causes currently working to solve them.</p>\n                <p>Mercy Adetoyese, ASA\u2019s president, said she has helped set up the pageant since her freshman year and thought of the event as a way to display African culture in University Park.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis pageant is a way for people to showcase their culture, their identity, to the rest of Penn State and, honestly, it takes a lot of guts and bravery to even be up here, so going from being a shy and timid person to being able to get up on that stage is something I also truly admire,\u201d Adetoyese, a fourth-year studying biobehavioral health, said.</p>\n                <p>She said the pageant served as a way to show Penn State students, especially those within minority groups, that there is a supportive community for them on campus.</p>\n                <p>The pageant kicked off at 5:55 p.m. as contestants were met with applause from attendees as they entered Heritage Hall.</p>\n                <p>Rasha Elwakil, who competed as Miss Egypt to spread awareness about disability-related stigmas, said she saw the pageant as a way to step out of her comfort zone while showcasing Egyptian culture.</p>\n                <p>She said she hoped attendees left the pageant having learned about the importance of everyone\u2019s causes, as well as the diversity of Africa.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAll of our countries, we've learned, either have some similarities that are really, really cool; they also all have a lot of differences that make all of our cultures unique,\u201d Elwakil, a fourth-year studying geography, said. \u201cI want them to learn more about all of us as contestants and who we are. I think we really showcase our personalities throughout this entire experience and so that's going to be really cool to showcase throughout the night and have people learn more about who we are, as well as our causes.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Contestant Khamaal Akinwande, who competed as Mr. Nigeria and advocated for increased prostate cancer resources, said he hoped attendees would see ASA as more than just another student organization on campus.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI hope they leave here with an interest in not just my culture, but all of the contestants' culture,\u201d Akinwande, a first-year studying cybersecurity, said. \u201cI hope they understand that ASA is a place where we don't just come to talk about classes or the workload or how our week is going. We come to truly engage with others, learn about our cultures and how we can cultivate those cultures to build a stronger bond between each other.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The pageant concluded at 10 p.m. following the crowning of Ader Deng, a first-year studying cybersecurity who advocated for increased educational resources as the pageant\u2019s first Mr. South Sudan, and Zara Amos, a first-year studying political science who advocated for ending period poverty as Miss Ghana, as Mr. and Miss Africa.</p>\n                <p>They were crowned by Wisdom Moses, ASA\u2019s public relations chair and 2025 Mr. Africa winner.</p>\n                <p>Ian Mwaura, who travelled to University Park from Williamsport to attend the pageant, said he believed Deng\u2019s and Amos\u2019s victories were well deserved based on what he saw during events, such as the talent show, and the causes they presented.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMr. South Sudan, he did his thing, his talent definitely stood out, his principles and what he stands for also stuck out and the same thing with Miss Ghana,\u201d Mwaura, a third-year studying heating, ventilation and air conditioning engineering technology at the Pennsylvania College of Technology, said. \u201cEverybody talks about the problems that go on in the world but to actually make an organization at such a young age, to tackle them and get your hands dirty and do something about it, that's very commendable.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "No. 8 Penn State men\u2019s hockey completes series sweep over Notre Dame",
    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After taking a 4-1 victory over Notre Dame in a physical, special-teams battle Friday night, No. 8 Penn State returned to Pegula Ice Arena on Saturday for a conference rematch.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Nittany Lions skating without a 12th forward or an extra skater due to a series of injuries, they held on to capture the series sweep with a 6-3 win.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have consistently struggled to score first and do so early, but that factor was nowhere to be found on Saturday night.</p>\n                <p>To the sound of the Roar Zone\u2019s opening chants, alternate captain Jarod Crespo found forward JJ Wiebusch as he was entering the offensive zone. At the same time, a Notre Dame defender lost an edge, leaving one of Penn State\u2019s top producers all alone with goaltender Nicholas Kempf.</p>\n                <p>Wiebusch flicked a backhand pass over Kempf that ricocheted off both posts and in, giving the Nittany Lions an early lead.</p>\n                <p>The offensive dominance didn\u2019t let up, and the home team added another just over six minutes later. Freshman defenseman Jackson Smith unleashed his signature slap shot from Notre Dame\u2019s blue line to double Penn State\u2019s early lead.</p>\n                <p>Following up Friday night\u2019s 15 penalty night, the physicality was evident early on.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were first to the box after the officials called freshman Lev Katzin for a holding penalty, but they held off Notre Dame's top-ten-ranked power-play unit.</p>\n                <p>Just over a minute after the first penalty expired, the blue and white went right back on the penalty kill, this time after defenseman Carter Schade went to the box for hooking.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Irish only had 17 seconds on the power play before defenseman Henry Nelson was sent to the box for interference, with the next minute and a half being 4-on-4 hockey.</p>\n                <p>As the first frame was coming to a close, Notre Dame stunned the crowd in Hockey Valley into silence when its relatively quiet offense scored two back-to-back goals just seconds apart to tie the game.</p>\n                <p>The first goal was scored by forward Brennan Ali with just 1:36 left to go in the period, and junior Cole Knuble\u2019s goal off the rebound came just 15 seconds later, to even the score heading into the first intermission.</p>\n                <p>Penn State regained some of its initial momentum in the middle frame, and freshman Gavin McKenna was there to capitalize on it. Smith picked up his second point of the night after he found McKenna off the rush, and the forward potted his fifth of the season.</p>\n                <p>Hockey Valley\u2019s energy matched the physicality level, and after Smith and Knuble got into it and were both given minor penalties, Pegula Ice Arena roared louder.</p>\n                <p>Another Fighting Irish penalty shortly after turned the 4-on-4 into a Nittany Lion power play. Instead of giving the blue and white an advantage, however, Notre Dame\u2019s Sutter Muzzatti notched a shorthanded goal and tied the game for the second time.</p>\n                <p>Three back-to-back penalties through the next five minutes of play maintained the theme of the weekend of special teams battles.</p>\n                <p>After nine total penalties, the game finally saw its first power play goal. DiMarsico \u2014 who registered a hat trick on Friday night, including two goals on the power play \u2014 cleaned up a loose puck around Kempf\u2019s crease, and retook Penn State\u2019s lead heading into the final period.</p>\n                <p>The third period held much of the same, with a rotation of Nittany Lions and Fighting Irish skaters heading to the box, but both teams struggled to capitalize on their opportunities.</p>\n                <p>After McKenna\u2019s initial goal, the momentum shift from the forward was evident. The top 2026 NHL draft prospect\u2019s speed and skill provided multiple high-danger chances throughout the game, and his second of the night seemed almost inevitable.</p>\n                <p>It finally came with about nine minutes to go in the game, after the Yukon, Whitehorse native fired home a loose puck in front of Kempf\u2019s net.</p>\n                <p>McKenna\u2019s second of the night was followed up by an empty net goal from captain Dane Dowiak to seal the 6-3 win and series sweep for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State begins a tough Big Ten stretch, first traveling to No. 2 Wisconsin for a 7 p.m. puck drop on Jan. 23.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Senior Amelia McBain jumped 3.75 meters for a season best.</p>\n                <p>The men\u2019s shot put got the ball rolling for record-breaking performances for the Nittany Lions, as Ryan Henry and Dylan Lambrecht tied for first place with throws of 19.43 meters, the fifth-best in school history.</p>\n                <p>MIT transfer Sam Engebretson finished fifth with a personal-best throw of 17.62 meters.</p>\n                <p>Senior Alex Pancoast earned the fifth first-place finish of the morning for Penn State in the women\u2019s weight throw following an 18.55-meter throw.

She came back and finished fourth in the finals, setting another personal best with a time of 8.50.</p>\n                <p>Despite not making the finals in the 60m hurdles, sophomore Addyson White earned her spot in the women\u2019s 60m with a 7.69 for 10th place.

Freshman Macey Shriner finished shortly behind in 1:32.82 for third place.</p>\n                <p>The men\u2019s 600m saw top performances from Penn State as well, as Nebraska transfer Niko Schultz finished second with a personal-best 1:16.35, followed by Kaleb Nastari\u2019s personal best of 1:16.89 for third.</p>\n                <p>After finishing second in the long jump, Schreiber came back and won the triple jump with a season-best 12.96-meter jump.</p>\n                <p>The men\u2019s high jump saw the Nittany Lions continue their win streak as freshman Trip Campbell finished first with a personal-best 2.15-meter jump.

One of the owners, Andrew Divelbiss, said he wanted to bring Phil to Happy Valley so he could experience life outside of Punxsutawney.</p>\n                <p>\u201cState College is such a good town to introduce people to Phil,\u201d Divelbiss said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big thing that everybody in Punxsutawney tries to do is spread the incredible thing of Punxsutawney Phil.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With the help of his family, who are a part of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, Divelbiss said he was able to bring his family and business together through the event.</p>\n                <p>Excitement buzzed through the line as students and locals waited to see Phil and hopefully and take pictures with him.</p>\n                <p>During the event, handlers and club members handed out Punxsutawney Groundhog Club tokens and top hats.</p>\n                <p>Many attendees learned about the event online, but Sophia Balaratna said she heard through word of mouth and knew she wanted to attend.</p>\n                <p>As a Pennsylvania native, Balaratna said she grew up hearing about Punxsutawney Phil and wanted to meet him.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was really excited, I\u2019m a big fan of Phil,\u201d Balaratna, a fourth-year studying mechanical engineering said.</p>\n                <p>She left him with some encouraging words for his big day coming up, and to hopefully help get the prediction she wants to have for the seasonal weather.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI love you Phil, but please no more winter,\u201d Balaratna said.</p>\n                <p>Sagufta Muktadir, also a Pennsylvania native, said she knew she needed to attend the moment she read about the event.</p>\n                <p>Muktadir, a fourth-year studying biomedical engineering, said she and her family are fond of Phil, but have never traveled to Punxsutawney for Groundhog Day.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI love him,\u201d Muktadir said. \u201cI love his predictions and everything \u2014 I was super hyped to come and see him in person.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After starting the season 3-0, Penn State got a look at its first ranked team of the season, hosting No. 9 Lewis in Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>On Saturday night, the Nittany Lions picked up their first ranked win of the season, beating the Flyers 3-1 to hand them their first loss on the season.</p>\n                <p>The first two points of the opening set the two split at 1-1 after a Penn State opening serve error that Lewis matched when it committed a mistake of the same nature.</p>\n                <p>It was all Lewis in the early running, though, as it jumped to a 7-3 advantage in the set after a few more Nittany Lion errors.</p>\n                <p>Penn State used a timeout when it went down 11-6. Only one of Lewis\u2019s points came from a kill, as all the rest came from errant blue and white serves or attacks.</p>\n                <p>Owen Rose and Jaxon Herr gave the Nittany Lions their first lead of the night after a block assist gave them a 17-16 edge. Penn State rode that wave to the end to capture the first set 25-21 after back-to-back Sean Harvey kills.</p>\n                <p>Now one step closer to a top-10 win, Penn State got on the board first in the second set and jumped up to a 4-1 lead after back-to-back Gaige Gabriel kills and an ace from Herr.</p>\n                <p>Lewis used a timeout after the blue and white took an 11-8 advantage after a Matthew Luoma kill.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions felt themselves closing in on a 2-0 lead on the night after capturing a seven-point lead in the latter stages of the second set, thanks to consecutive Flyers errors.</p>\n                <p>A Luoma kill off the assist from Herr allowed Penn State to capture the second set 25-18 to move one set closer to a sweep over a top-10 team.</p>\n                <p>Once again, Penn State started the action due to a Lewis error. It was the Flyers\u2019 12th attack error of the night.</p>\n                <p>For the first time in a while, though, the Nittany Lions found themselves down and facing a 5-2 deficit thanks to Oguzhan Oguz picking up his sixth and seventh kills of the night \u2013 the most of any Flyer at that point.</p>\n                <p>Another Gaige kill was just another point Penn State traded with Lewis until an 8-8 standstill turned into a two-point lead for the Flyers, thanks to a Gauthier Brozak kill that he followed up with an ace.</p>\n                <p>Lewis extended its lead to 15-13 before a Tristan Hassell kill made it a one-point game that Penn State capitalized on and turned into a little scoring run, as it captured a 16-15 lead thanks to a Brozak error and a Gaige ace.</p>\n                <p>Inching closer to a win, the blue and white snuck up to 20-18 after another Harvey kill \u2013 his 10th of the night.</p>\n                <p>The Flyers weren\u2019t going away that easily, though, and Penn State took a timeout after a 3-0 Lewis scoring run put the Nittany Lions down 21-20.</p>\n                <p>After some more back-and-forth, Lewis did just enough to win the third set 25-23 and keep the night going after a Daniel Haber kill.</p>\n                <p>Following the rest of the night, the fourth set started off tight until the Flyers jumped out to a 5-3 lead in the early running after kills from Brozak and Haber.</p>\n                <p>Consecutive Hassell kills gave him six on the night, but Lewis was still comfortably ahead, holding a 12-7 advantage prior to the Nittany Lions calling a timeout.</p>\n                <p>It was all Hassell as Penn State was closing in on the lead after the six-foot-six freshman picked up his eighth kill to cut the deficit to 16-13.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions battled back and went on a 3-0 run, with Hassell picking up two more kills to gain a 23-21 edge.</p>\n                <p>Momentum shifted back the other way for a moment, but Penn State held on and captured the fourth set 25-22 to secure the 3-1 win.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State hits the road for the first time this season for a two-game series against McKendree next weekend.

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State got itself back on track following its first loss in the AHA to Mercyhurst with a 4-1 victory over conference-opponent Syracuse in Game 1. The Nittany Lions returned to Tennity Ice Pavilion in Syracuse, New York, on Saturday afternoon for Game 2 of the series, looking for their first sweep since late November.</p>\n                <p>Unlike the previous meetings with the Orange, Penn State was given a run for its money, gritting out a 3-2 victory behind a pair of goals by captain Tessa Janecke. The Nittany Lions improved to 21-4 on the season, and secured the season-sweep over Syracuse.</p>\n                <p>Goaltender Maddy Campbell was given her fifth-straight start for the blue and white, in Katie DeSa\u2019s absence due to an undisclosed injury. The Courtice, Ontario, native made 13 saves on 14 shots in Friday\u2019s victory before closing out the series with 31 saves on 33 shots on Saturday, improving to 5-2 on the season.</p>\n                <p>The teams jumped out of the gates with blazing speed, with the Nittany Lions getting play started when Abby Stonehouse and McKenna Walsh were stopped at the crease on a 2-on-1. The Orange\u2019s Jackson Kinsler responded with a breakaway that was stopped by Campbell.</p>\n                <p>But Kinsler\u2019s next attempt broke the ice. Just over three minutes into the game, the Madison, Wisconsin, native picked up her own rebound and beat Campbell under her glove.</p>\n                <p>However, the AHA-leading Nittany Lions didn\u2019t stay down for long. Grace Outwater floated a backhand shot past freshman goaltender Ava Drabyk to tie the game, with 14:10 left in the period.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s powerplay got to work midway through the first period, when Emma Gnade tripped Janecke in the offensive zone. Janecke responded 23 seconds into the advantage, striding down the left side boards before cutting to the middle and firing a wrist shot past Drabyk to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>Just over five minutes into the second period, the Orange were awarded their first power-play opportunity as Grace Tullock headed to sin bin for tripping. Maya D\u2019Arcy ensured that the special teams remained perfect, as she tallied her first of the season 30-seconds later to tie the game at 2-2.</p>\n                <p>With 11:25 remaining in the middle frame, Celia Wiegand\u2019s interference infraction gave the Nittany Lions their second power play of the game. However, Drabyk made a series of saves in tight to keep the game knotted.</p>\n                <p>The penalty box was again populated as Mya Vaslet took a boarding penalty in the offensive zone. Syracuse peppered Campbell with shots, but the Nittany Lions cleared the penalty after sending the puck down the length of the ice.</p>\n                <p>Following a back-and-forth affair in Penn State\u2019s zone, the Nittany Lions cleared the puck to Janecke, who entered the zone with speed. She made a nifty move to the slot before rifling a shot under Drabyk\u2019s globe for her 16th goal of the season, now leading the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Despite applying offensive pressure early in the third period, the officials called Penn State\u2019s Maddy Christian to the penalty box for interference. The blue and white easily cleared the penalty, but struggled to generate offense throughout the early goings of the frame.</p>\n                <p>That was until Heidi Knoll took a tripping penalty right off a face-off outside of Penn State\u2019s zone. Although the Nittany Lions weren\u2019t able to find the net, they shaved valuable time off the clock.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white continued to dominate the possession, winding down the clock with an intense forecheck. Syracuse was unable to pull Drabyk until the 48-second mark, leading to the Orange having limited time to tie the game.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white cleared the puck with one second remaining, and Campbell made a final save to secure the 3-2 victory.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Senior goaltender Katie DeSa has remained out with an undisclosed injury since Jan. 2, when she was shaken up midway through the third period against No. 2 Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will stay in the state of New York, travelling to Ithaca to face No. 10 Cornell for the second time this season. The Nittany Lions previously beat the Big Red, 1-0, on Dec. 30.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will stay on the road and travel nearly four hours east of Iowa City to Evanston, Illinois to take on Northwestern in the second dual of the weekend.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will take on the Wildcats at 3 p.m. Sunday, with the matchup being streamed on Big Ten Plus.</p>\n                <p>No. 1 Penn State is coming off a 32-3 victory against No. 4 Iowa in front of a raucous Carver-Hawkeye Arena. On the other side, Northwestern fell to No. 18 Wisconsin, 28-12, in Madison, Wisconsin. Now, the Nittany Lions will head to Evanston in an attempt to keep their historic win streak alive.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how each weight class matches up ahead of the Sunday matinee dual.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 2 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 26 Dedrick Navarro (NU)</p>\n                <p>Dedrick Navarro\u2019s ranking understates his ability after a victory over No. 11 Nicolar Rivera. However, Rivera isn\u2019t in the same tier as Luke Lilledahl, who just defeated No. 6 Dean Peterson.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl brings a style that isn\u2019t normal, a quick, slippery approach that catches most opponents off guard. Coming off a convincing victory, the Nittany Lion could get back to his bonus-point scoring.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 24 Sean Spidle (NU)</p>\n                <p>Continuing with what are the best matches on paper, Marcus Blaze and Sean Spidle will face off in a young vs. old match. Blaze is a true freshman, who\u2019s still undefeated, while Spidle holds an 11-5 record as a redshirt senior.</p>\n                <p>Blaze is coming off a victory over 2025 national finalist, Drake Ayala, and could continue his dominant start against a wrestler with less caliber than that of Ayala.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 7 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 32 Billy Dekraker (NU)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis was the only wrestler to lose in the Nittany Lions\u2019 dual against Iowa. However, he\u2019ll take on a significantly lower-ranked opponent in Billy Dekraker. The Wildcat came out victorious against an unranked Wisconsin wrestler, but will take on a top-10 wrestler in Davis.</p>\n                <p>Davis is still acclimating himself to full-time wrestling after getting his redshirt pulled. He was noticeably gassed in his match against No. 11 Nasir Bailey of Iowa, but could put that behind him to get his first ranked victory of the season.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. Sam Cartella (NU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness proved he\u2019s a force to be reckoned with after defeating No. 17 Ryder Block of Iowa. Against Northwestern, Van Ness could face an unranked Sam Cartella.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness will put his 12-0 record on the line against Cartella or August Hibler, who wrestled against Wisconsin. Hibler fell 11-6 to No. 16 Joseph Zargo and would face an even tougher opponent on Sunday if he wrestles both matches on the weekend.</p>\n                <p>With the Wildcats\u2019 149-pound starter still unknown, it could allow Van Ness to showcase his strength and earn bonus points.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Gunnar Myers (NU)</p>\n                <p>Starting at 149 pounds with Van Ness, and continuing at 157 pounds, the Nittany Lions could really catapult the dual score. PJ Duke won a tight battle against No. 12 Jordan Williams of Iowa, but gets a lighter opponent in Gunnar Myers, who\u2019s unranked on the season.</p>\n                <p>Myers lost by a major decision to No. 26 Luke Mechler, a 23-rank difference from Duke who\u2019s undefeated and a national title contender. Duke could add yet another bonus-point victory to his resum\u00e9, while remaining undefeated in his inaugural season.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. Jacob Bostelman (NU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink proved yet again he\u2019s on a tier of his own against Iowa. He took down No. 3 Michael Caliendo for the seventh time in his career, extending the gap between him and the Hawkeye after Caliendo closed it at the Big Ten Championships and the NCAA Championships.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink will face a significantly worse opponent on paper. Jacob Bostelman lost by tech fall to No. 26 Cody Goebel. Mesenbrink\u2019s gas tank has been unmatched ever since his championship match against Iowa State\u2019s David Carr in 2024.</p>\n                <p>With a significantly stronger emphasis on back points and falls, Mesenbrink could add to his pinfall total.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 32 Eddie Enright (NU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines will take on Northwestern\u2019s final ranked wrestler in chronological order from lightest to heaviest weight classes.</p>\n                <p>Haines wrestled a close match against Gabe Arnold, who has bounced around multiple weight classes during his career. However, Haines will take on a wrestler who\u2019s 18-5 heading into Sunday. The Nittany Lion has also had more of a focus on back points, especially after fully filling into the 174-pound weight class.</p>\n                <p>Enright will have his hands full with Haines, who provides a mix of speed and power, and is currently in a tier of his own at 174.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 4 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. J.D. Perez (NU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh had arguably the biggest win of the entire season, earning a defensively focused victory over No. 1 Angelo Ferrari. Welsh showed poise and patience, defeating Ferrari in tiebreakers, keeping Ferrari down for 27 seconds.</p>\n                <p>Now, Welsh can show more of his aggressive side against J.D. Perez. The Wildcat took down Caleb Dennee, 7-6, but will have his hands full with potentially the next No. 1-wrestler at 184 when the updated InterMat poll is released.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. Alex Smith (NU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr is fully back from his injury, and didn\u2019t have to face one of his initial big tests in Massoma Endene, who\u2019s no longer on Iowa\u2019s roster.</p>\n                <p>Barr will take on another unranked opponent in Alex Smith, who\u2019s struggled against ranked wrestlers. Smith lost by fall to No. 28 Wyatt Ingham of Wisconsin, and Barr appears to be a different kind of beast as the leading candidate for the national title with his No. 1 ranking.</p>\n                <p>The final weight classes could prove to be the dagger in a blowout victory for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 13 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Gabe Christenson (NU)</p>\n                <p>Another wrestler who\u2019s coming off the biggest win of his season is Cole Mirasola, who is riding high heading into his unranked matchup. Mirasola took down No. 5 Ben Kueter of Iowa, solidifying his spot as an All-American threat.</p>\n                <p>Gabe Christenson hasn\u2019t had success against ranked wrestlers, and Mirasola provides a different kind of heavyweight for him. The Nittany Lion is one of the more undersized heavyweights, something that\u2019ll allow the Wildcat to match up better, as he\u2019s listed on the roster at 197 pounds.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola will be the heavier wrestler for likely one of the only times in his career against a wrestler who typically wrestles at 197.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Heading into No. 8 Penn State and Notre Dame\u2019s first meeting of the season, they were two of the three most penalized teams in the country, meaning a special teams battle was likely ahead. After a combined 14 penalties and 41 penalty minutes, those proved to be the difference maker Friday night.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 special teams propelled them to a 4-1 conference victory over the Fighting Irish.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white took to the ice in front of a lively Roar Zone \u2014 the first time the home team had played in front of the packed student section in over two months.</p>\n                <p>Both teams were dealing with holes in the lineups after Penn State was hit with the injury bug, forcing it to skate with only 11 forwards, and Notre Dame\u2019s leading scorer, defenseman Paul Fischer, was suspended for the two-game series.</p>\n                <p>The opening minutes were largely a back-and-forth battle, with both teams trying to find their offensive momentum.</p>\n                <p>The game saw its first penalty a little over halfway through the first period, after Notre Dame\u2019s Jayden Davis was called for interference, sending the Nittany Lions to the power play.</p>\n                <p>About 40 seconds in, forward Matt DiMarsico broke the ice for the blue and white, set up by a tic-tac-toe passing sequence with Gavin McKenna and Luke Misa.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Irish \u2014 and their No. 7 nationally ranked power play \u2014 got their own opportunity a few minutes later, after senior defenseman Jarod Crespo was called for holding.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s penalty kill unit, along with a very solid performance from goaltender Josh Fleming, kept Notre Dame off the board on the man-advantage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was really happy with the penalty kill,\u201d Guy Gadowsky said. \u201c(Notre Dame\u2019s) an excellent power play team\u2026but all in all, I thought all game the penalty kill was really good.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With just over a minute to go in the first frame, Davis headed back to the box, this time for high-sticking, but Penn State couldn\u2019t capitalize on its second attempt.</p>\n                <p>The physicality, while always present, ramped up in the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>Notre Dame\u2019s Cole Brown laid a high hit on captain Dane Dowiak, and the freshman was awarded a five-minute major and a game misconduct, while the blue and white headed to an extended man-advantage.</p>\n                <p>DiMarsico once again took advantage of the extra attacker and fired a shot on net that was redirected out in front of goaltender Nicholas Kempf and found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>Notre Dame answered with a power play goal of its own shortly after, after Crespo made his second trip to the penalty box.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white regained its two-goal lead and tallied its third power play score of the night with about two minutes to go in the middle frame, after Sutter Muzzatti\u2019s roughing penalty led to Misa tallying his third point of the night off a one-timer that rocketed past Kempf.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe were moving pucks really well, I mean, we were playing with speed, we\u2019re winning faceoffs too,\u201d Misa said. \u201c(the power play) was just clicking today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The theme of penalties continued on into the final period, first with the Nittany Lions\u2019 Carter Schade being sent to the box for hooking. The home team\u2019s penalty kill once again held strong and maintained its lead.</p>\n                <p>The intensity boiled over late in the third period, starting with defenseman Jackson Smith laying out a Notre Dame skater to the roar of the crowd. Muzzatti retaliated and went after freshman McKenna along the boards, and was quickly surrounded by Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Both Muzzatti and Smith walked away with penalties, but the 4-on-4 quickly turned to a 4-on-3 after Reese Laubach was given a slashing penalty 30 seconds later.</p>\n                <p>After pulling the goaltender, Notre Dame had a two-skater advantage for its last push in an attempt to close its gap, but the blue and white\u2019s strong defensive efforts continued through the final minutes.</p>\n                <p>DiMarsico sealed the game and a dominant performance, with an empty net goal to tally his third hat trick of the season, and 13th total goal.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about him because I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know how he does what he does,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHis mind is elite. His stick is better than elite.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 8 Penn State swept Minnesota last weekend, but it came at a cost.</p>\n                <p>Star forward Charlie Cerrato exited Friday\u2019s 3-0 win with an injury that caused him to miss Saturday\u2019s 5-2 victory. The next night, forward Braeden Ford was helped off the ice with a lower-body injury that head coach Guy Gadowsky said will sideline him for a \u201csignificant amount of time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With forward Keaton Peters out for the season and forward Shea Van Olm sidelined with an injury, the Nittany Lions were thin offensively as they welcomed Notre Dame on Friday at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Down to just 11 forwards, Penn State defeated Notre Dame 4-1. The win propelled the Nittany Lions to 15-6 and marked their fourth straight Big Ten victory.</p>\n                <p>Following a goaltender interference penalty against Notre Dame\u2019s Jayden Davis, Penn State earned the game\u2019s first power play. And on the man advantage, two of its stars connected with a new power-play linemate to break through.</p>\n                <p>As he typically does when given time and space, a calm Gavin McKenna scanned the ice before lasering a pass to Luka Misa. The freshman forward, who filled in for Cerrato on Penn State\u2019s top power-play line, one-timed a pass to Matt DiMarsico, who ripped a slap shot into the top right corner to give the Nittany Lions a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>But Misa wasn\u2019t done there.</p>\n                <p>After DiMarsico and Notre Dame\u2019s Evan Werner traded goals, the Nittany Lions were back on the power play. And off a slot feed from Ben Schoen, Misa rifled one beyond Nicholas Kempf\u2019s outstretched glove to give Penn State a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n                <p>A MISA MISSILE!!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAre?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeAre</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HockeyValley?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HockeyValley</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7gPZijln2t\">pic.twitter.com/7gPZijln2t</a>&mdash; Penn State Men\u2019s Hockey (@PennStateMHKY) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennStateMHKY/status/2012336628862165028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 17, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>It was his seventh point in his last five games \u2014 a turning point for a forward whose lack of production had undermined a terrific start to his freshman campaign.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThings have just started going my way,\u201d Misa said. \u201cI feel like I had a lot of chances in the (first) half, but things just weren't going in. So it's nice to see things go down.\u201d</p>\n                <p>To provide context to the extent of Penn State\u2019s injury bug, it forced Gadowsky to play three defensemen on the same line several times, with extra skater and natural defenseman Nick Fascia serving as a de facto forward. The team even left the fourth-line right winger spot blank on the pregame lineup sheet because there was no healthy forward to fill it with.</p>\n                <p>While some played different roles, forward Dane Dowiak showed up as his typical gritty self, and Penn State\u2019s captain drew two penalties, each leading to a power-play goal.</p>\n                <p>Early in the second period, Dowiak outraced Notre Dame\u2019s Cole Brown for a loose puck along the boards of Penn State\u2019s defensive zone. A frustrated Brown leveled Dowiak with a booming hit to the head, drawing the ire of the Pegula fans.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDane is a tough kid. When you talk about a guy stepping up in a leadership role, that's what you had from him tonight,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe played tough. He won faceoffs. He stuck up for his team. He did everything that a leader should do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The officials handed Brown a five-minute major and a game misconduct, which led to Penn State\u2019s first tally. Later in the period, Dowiak caught another high hit while scrapping for a loose puck among three Fighting Irish skaters.</p>\n                <p>The defense cleared the puck, and Dowiak drew another penalty, this one a roughing call on Sutter Muzzatti. Misa scored shortly after to give the Nittany Lions some cushion in a tight contest \u2014 a testament to his captain\u2019s resolute play.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Dane) is our captain. He's our leader,\u201d DiMarsico said. \u201cTo see a guy take a couple of hits like that and not retaliate at all sends a message to the power play that you gotta have that same work ethic. If someone's going to take a hit like that and not respond, you better make it worth it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>After securing its highest-ever home opening score against Yale last weekend, Penn State women\u2019s gymnastics traveled to Illinois to try to better last weekend\u2019s historic effort.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started a winning streak with a victory over Illinois, 196.075-194.100, short of last week\u2019s massive Week One score.</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>The first away meet of the year brought new challenges for Penn State, like opening on bars.</p>\n                <p>Ellie Monahan opened the rotation in a big way for head coach Sarah Brown. She was a bit short on her first handstand and pirouette on the low bar, but just a small hop on her dismount opened the meet with a strong 9.775.</p>\n                <p>Jessica Johanson followed it up with an ever cleaner routine. Similar to Monahan, she had to take a hop on her dismount, also scoring a 9.775. Elizabeth Leary put up a massive routine in the middle of the lineup, nailing her straddled jaeger to overshoot connection, followed by a perfectly stuck dismount. She improved from last week\u2019s routine with a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Ava Piedrahita, coming off her ACL injury last season, was back in the bars lineup. She showcased textbook form throughout, taking just a small shuffle on her dismount, putting a huge exclamation mark on her bars debut with a massive 9.925.</p>\n                <p>Ava Cash was aggressive on her opening handstand, but with her shoulders and hips too far over the bar, she came off. Starting her whole routine over after the fall, the freshman scored a low 8.900.</p>\n                <p>Looking to drop Cash\u2019s score, Dani Lartronica did not hold back. She hit her handstands right on top of the bar, nailed her piked jaeger, and stuck her toe-shoot piked half for a 9.875 to end the rotation.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, on the vault, Illinois showed off a few strong Yurchenko fulls with some key missteps in the lineup for a 48.625 trailing Penn State\u2019s 49.200 total. The highlight was Chloe Cho\u2019s 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Leary opened up with a powerful Yurchenko full, resulting in a large hop back after a strong block, scoring a 9.700. Cash followed it up with a massive Yurchenko full. She had some leg separation on the table and a hop back for a 9.700.</p>\n                <p>Bringing back her Yurchenko one and a half this season, Kaempfer slightly underrotated her vault, needing to take a step back. Starting out of a 10.0, the sophomore managed a 9.775. Johanson had one of the strongest Yurchenko fulls with just a small hop for a rotation-high 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Latronica had another small hop on her Yurchenko full for a 9.775. Piedhraita took just a small hop on her half on, pike off for another 9.775 to anchor the rotation.</p>\n                <p>On the bars, Illinois picked up the momentum. Cho continued her incredible night with a massive 9.950 to pass Piedrahita to win the event. Lyden Saltness ended the rotation with a 9.900 as well, but it wasn\u2019t enough as Penn State led after two rotations, 98.050-97.550.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Not Penn State\u2019s strongest event, the Nittany Lions needed to keep up the momentum. Johanson, not in the floor lineup last weekend, led off and did just that. She opened with a strong double pike. One and a half into a front half with another strong landing to get the rotation off to the right start with a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Monhanan, a front tumbler built off Johanson\u2019s performance. She opened with a front double full and finished with a front lay front full, all with solid landings for another 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Maul opened her routine with a massive stuck double tuck, not needing to lunge back. On her second, she was short on her layout after underrotating her one and a half for a low 9.625.</p>\n                <p>Bella Misiura opened with an E pass, a front double full. She finished with a front full but was unable to continue her front layout, needing to tuck her legs, bringing her start value down, scoring a low 9.475.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Kramer tried to get the Nittany Lions back on track. Another strong front tumbler, she opened with a big front double full and finished with a Rudi to layout stepout to score a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Kalea McElligott anchored the rotation with a gorgeous double tuck and a one-and-a-half to front layout for a 9.825 to help Penn State hold the lead.</p>\n                <p>On the beam, Illinois faced a lot of struggles, including a fall. However, Cho continued her strong night with a big 9.675. Despite their struggles on the floor, the Nittany Lions still led Illinois 146.925 or 146.575-145.850 going into the final rotation.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Closing out on beam, the blue and white bounced back from a low 48.875 on the floor. Monahan led off with a front toss to swing down acro series, taking a small hop on her dismount for a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Kramer bailed her backhandspring-layout stepout to keep the momentum going for a 9.775. Maul crushed her triple series and stuck her landing cold for a huge 9.850. McElligott followed up Maul with another massive triple series and stuck a dismount for a matching 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Leary followed with another triple series and stuck dismount, copying and pasting three straight routines for a 9.775. Latronica nailed her series as well, showcasing her flexibility and clean lines for a rotation-high 9.875 in the anchor position.</p>\n                <p>Despite a strong floor rotation, including Cho\u2019s event-winning tying 9.825, it wasn\u2019t enough for Illinois to overtake Penn State\u2019s strong beam finish.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State welcomes Big Ten foe Maryland at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 25, in Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Fisher | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It wasn\u2019t long ago Penn State was winless in Big Ten play, scratching and clawing for its first conference win in South Bend to begin the second half of the 2024-25 campaign. In that instance, the Nittany Lions persevered and defeated Notre Dame to spark a historic 23-game run for the program.</p>\n                <p>Friday, a mere calendar year later, the roles reversed, as the Fighting Irish were a bleak 0-10 in Big Ten play. This time, it was Penn State defending home ice.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions did what Notre Dame couldn\u2019t a year ago, winning in their home arena by a final score of 4-1, and extending their win streak to four games.</p>\n                <p>First period</p>\n                <p>Penn State came out of the gates firing on all cylinders. The Nittany Lions earned 10 shots on goal through the midway point of the first period, controlling play and dominating offensive-zone time, in large part due to winger Gavin McKenna.</p>\n                <p>That consistent offensive effort reaped its rewards with just under eight minutes remaining in the frame after Notre Dame center Jayden Davis was pinned with an interference penalty, putting Penn State on the man-advantage.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 power-play unit took the ice and looked the sharpest it has all season. Just 40 seconds into the man-advantage, McKenna engaged in a tic-tac-toe action with wingers Luke Misa and Matt DiMarsico, where he found Misa across ice, who one-tapped the puck to DiMarsico in the bumper.</p>\n                <p>The junior sniped a relatively wide-open net, breaking the ice and giving the Nittany Lions a 1-0 advantage, which was the only scoring for either team all period.</p>\n                <p>Second period</p>\n                <p>Penn State entered the second frame on a short man-advantage, and while it didn\u2019t last long, the Nittany Lions quickly returned to the power play after Notre Dame winger Cole Brown laid a massive hit on center Dane Dowiak along the boards, which the referees determined as a major penalty and game misconduct after a short review.</p>\n                <p>Unlike the first period, however, Penn State was lifeless in the man-advantage. Over four minutes of game action went by with minimal offensive zone time for the Nittany Lions. But in the final minute of the major penalty, Penn State took a 2-0 lead with a little bit of luck.</p>\n                <p>DiMarsico leisurely controlled the puck by the right dot before firing a low shot into several bodies in front of Kempf. His shot ricocheted off a skate and into the back of the net to extend the Nittany Lions\u2019 advantage.</p>\n                <p>The story of the second frame continued to be defined by penalties, as the fourth one of the period, given to defenseman Jarod Crespo, put the Fighting Irish on a 4-on-3. Winger Evan Werner scored on a wrist shot just 37 seconds into Notre Dame\u2019s power play, cutting Penn State\u2019s lead to 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Over the final 10 minutes of the frame, there were three more penalties, bringing the period total up to seven. The Nittany Lions were the only team to capitalize on one of them, as Misa scored a one-timer off an assist from winger Ben Schoen, with just under three minutes remaining, extending Penn State\u2019s lead to 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Third period</p>\n                <p>The third period showcased more back-and-forth action, but nothing added to the scoreboard. Center Reese Laubach owned the best chance, as he had nearly a wide-open net from a rebound off the boards, but Kempf made a sprawling save to keep Notre Dame\u2019s deficit at two.</p>\n                <p>Three penalties, from both teams combined, in the span of 36 seconds, played into a hectic final five minutes of regulation. The Fighting Irish owned the 4-on-3 due to the penalties. Not much came of it, though, as Notre Dame went scoreless despite Werner ringing a post.</p>\n                <p>Penn State netminder Josh Fleming was a big proponent of the Nittany Lions killing off their penalties. He stood tall to maintain the Nittany Lions\u2019 lead, finishing the night saving 39-of-40 shots, good for a .975 save percentage.</p>\n                <p>DiMarsico hit the dagger on Friday, scoring the empty-net goal for his third hat trick of the season.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Center Charlie Cerrato was inactive for a second consecutive game with a day-to-day injury, while winger Braedon Ford remained out with a lower-body injury coach Guy Gadowsky disclosed as \u201clong-term,\u201d on Monday.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, winger Shea Van Olm was inactive with a day-to-day injury.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Penn State-Notre Dame series will conclude at 8 p.m. Saturday at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Dean Peterson needed a second to recover following the scrum, and when he returned to the circle, Luke Lilledahl took him down.</p>\n                <p>Peterson shocked Lilledahl by reversing the control for two points and the pair continued a scrappy battle without further scoring for the rest of the first round.</p>\n                <p>Peterson brought the bout within one point with an escape to start the second frame. He wrapped his arms around Lilledahl and nearly brought him down before Lilledahl countered with a left-handed high crotch to make Peterson lose balance, followed by a double-leg takedown. The second round ended with blood time for Lilledahl.</p>\n                <p>After Peterson let Lilledahl up to start the third, he secured another takedown to extend his lead to 11-4.

Ayala received a stall warning after running out of bounds when Blaze launched an attack. After Ayala received a stall penalty, Blaze completed the takedown before Ayala could reach the edge.</p>\n                <p>Ayala started the third with a quick escape and began putting pressure on Blaze, pushing him and launching the attacks, looking to come back from a 4-2 deficit. Blaze stalled as Ayala tried to pull him down, receiving a warning but securing the decision, earning a chorus of boos from the Iowa crowd.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 6, Iowa 0</p>\n                <p>141: No. 7 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs No. 11 Nasir Bailey (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Nasir Bailey has had a relatively down year, but showed his talent in this match, securing Iowa\u2019s first victory. Bailey took down Braeden Davis in the first period and stumped his offense for the final two frames.</p>\n                <p>After escaping in the second, Davis went on the offensive but Bailey continually avoided him, winning 3-2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 6, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs No. 17 Ryder Block (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Ryder Block opened aggressively, and after keeping himself low to the mat, picked Shayne Van Ness\u2019 leg to secure the first takedown. Van Ness quickly responded with a takedown of his own thirty seconds later.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness opened the second frame on top and rode out the entire period to hold the tie at 4-4, while accumulating over two minutes of riding time. Van Ness escaped in the third to secure the lead, but Block immediately picked his leg.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness picked his leg to counter and locked Block in a bow-and-arrow leading to a takedown and a four-point near-fall securing the 13-4 major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 10, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs No. 12 Jordan Williams (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke opened the match with vengeance, backing up Jordan Williams and nearly securing the takedown before his hold on Williams was deemed potentially dangerous. He continued shooting for the ankle after resetting, but couldn\u2019t get Williams off his feet.</p>\n                <p>After Williams escaped five seconds into the second period, Duke again went on the offensive and had Williams on the verge of neutral danger. As the clock expired, no points were awarded but assistant coach Cody Sanderson threw the challenge brick on Duke\u2019s behalf. The review upheld the call, and Duke entered the third trailing 1-0.</p>\n                <p>Duke stood up even faster than Williams did to go back to neutral, tied 1-1 in the third. After catching a shot from Williams, Duke circled around and landed the first takedown of the bout. Williams couldn\u2019t break the collar-and-elbow tie up for the rest of the bout, giving Duke the 4-1 decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 13, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 3 Michael Caliendo (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink and Michael Caliendo renewed their lopsided rivalry for the first time this season, and the seventh time in college. Mesenbrink has won all six prior matches.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink notched the first takedown, but only kept Caliendo down for fifteen seconds. Caliendo got a hold of Mesenbrink\u2019s leg, but Mesenbrink escaped unscathed. Caliendo received a stall call but remained on his feet using a defensive posture for the remainder of the first period.</p>\n                <p>Caliendo started visibly frustrating Mesenbrink in Round 2, not giving up a takedown until there were nine seconds left on the clock. Mesenbrink quickly escaped to start the third. A tired Caliendo looked resigned as his offensive attacks slowed in the final minute.</p>\n                <p>After Mesenbrink started attacking again, Caliendo got a stall call and Mesenbrink went on a mad scramble to land one last takedown in the final seconds to extend the lead to 11-2 and earn a major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 17, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Gabe Arnold (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Gabe Arnold filled in for All-American Patrick Kennedy, who has never beaten Levi Haines. It was Arnold\u2019s first NCAA match against a Nittany Lion after he had words for the program last season, but didn\u2019t end up wrestling in the dual at the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Haines held control immediately in the match, securing a takedown two minutes in and keeping his hands locked around Arnold as he scrambled out of the circle. Arnold escaped after a clock malfunction delayed the whistle, catching Haines off guard with a quick jump. The rest of the first two periods were an uneventful stalemate.</p>\n                <p>Arnold stood up and brought the score to 4-2 with slightly over a minute remaining. The two were head-to-head for most of the last minute as Arnold searched for an opening. Three attacks by Arnold didn\u2019t reach past Haines\u2019 defensive stand and he secured another decision for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 20, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>184: No. 4 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 1 Angelo Ferrari (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>The most anticipated slate of the dual was the top-five matchup at 184 pounds. Redshirt freshman Angelo Ferrari hadn\u2019t given up a takedown since becoming Iowa\u2019s starter. His defensive stance of staying on a knee forced Welsh to be patient throughout the first period. Neither man launched a real attack in the first three minutes.</p>\n                <p>After Ferrari escaped after 25 seconds in Round 2, the match returned to a chronic stalemate. The wrestlers finally spent a prolonged amount of time locked up in the third round after Welsh drew the score even with an escape.</p>\n                <p>With 30 seconds remaining in round 3, Ferrari drew a stall warning and renegaded with Welsh, but the bout advanced to sudden victory, tied 1-1.</p>\n                <p>In the extra frame, Ferrari secured an under-hook and got a grip around Welsh for the closest attack of the match to that point. Welsh returned the favor, powering Ferrari down but was out of bounds as the clock passed one minute. The draw continued and sent the contest to tiebreakers.</p>\n                <p>Welsh deferred on the coin flip and rode Ferrari for 15 seconds before a stall call reset the mat, much to the dismay of the crowd in Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Welsh secured two more mat returns en route to a full 30 seconds of riding time.</p>\n                <p>Welsh debated his options for a minute before electing to take the bottom, just needing an escape to win. Welsh successfully broke Ferrari\u2019s grip, leaving the top-ranked wrestler 17 seconds to take him down. Welsh backed off multiple Ferrari attempts and secured the upset to a chorus of boos.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 23, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. Brody Sampson (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Brody Sampson had his first match as Iowa\u2019s permanent 197 starter against the top-ranked wrestler in the class Josh Barr. Sampson took the spot after No. 4 Massoma Endene was removed from Iowa\u2019s roster earlier this week.</p>\n                <p>Barr welcomed Sampson with a takedown in the second minute. He led 6-1 following another takedown, and secured one more in the second period before locking Sampson in an assassin pin and securing the fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 29, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>285: No. 13 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. No. 5 Ben Kueter (Iowa)</p>\n                <p>The dual ended with the heavyweight bout between Cole Mirasola and Ben Kueter. Mirasola opened the rush against the larger Kueter, moving him backwards throughout the first minute.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola hooked Kueter\u2019s leg with a minute left in the first, but Kueter wrapped his arms around Mirasola to eventually break the danger with a stalemate call.</p>\n                <p>Kueter escaped 21 seconds into Round 2 and received a stall call while Mirasola tired him out in a heavy tie up. Kueter picked the ankle but couldn\u2019t control Mirasola, allowing him to unjam his foot and roll to his back for the takedown. Kueter escaped with three seconds on the clock and the bout entered the final frame, 3-2.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola escaped to extend the lead to 4-2, leaving Kueter about 90 seconds to attempt a takedown. Mirasola wouldn\u2019t let Kueter get close, drawing a stall call, but retained the lead and secured the 4-3 decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 32, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will hit the road to Evanston, Illinois, to face Northwestern at 3 p.m. Sunday.</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>An upset loss in overtime to Mercyhurst lingered in the mind of No. 4 Penn State as it traveled north to New York for a series against Syracuse.</p>\n                <p>With focus shifted to the task at hand, the Nittany Lions looked to get back on a winning streak as the back half of the season quickly approached. In a tightly contested game, Penn State used its high-powered offense to beat the Orange 4-1.</p>\n                <p>It was Maddy Campbell who got the nod against a surging Orange offense, which is fresh off a five-goal weekend. The freshman made her fourth-straight start in the absence of Katie DeSa.</p>\n                <p>The Orange looked as though it tightened things up defensively through the first 10 minutes. With the last matchup between both teams ending in an 11\u20132 victory for Penn State, Syracuse made obvious adjustments to slow down the Nittany Lions' forecheck.</p>\n                <p>The adjusted defense couldn\u2019t hold Penn State\u2019s offense for the entire duration of the opening period as Grace Outwater forced a turnover on the boards in the offensive zone. The Picton, Ontario, native snapped a quick shot from the faceoff circle that beat Ava Drabyk\u2019s glove.</p>\n                <p>With this goal, Outwater leads the AHA in goals with 14 on the season.</p>\n                <p>A full first 20 minutes seemingly controlled by Penn State came to a close as the Nittany Lions held the puck on the boards in the offensive zone.</p>\n                <p>It only took Mya Vaslet 20 seconds into the second period to open the scoring as she ripped a slapshot in close on Drabyk. With a look of shock on her face as she skated to the bench, this was the Stittsville, Ontario, native\u2019s third goal on the season, after scoring only once last season.</p>\n                <p>Pressure continued to develop from the Nittany Lions as Tessa Janecke found herself alone with Drabyk as she skated in close, ultimately missing the net on the backhand.</p>\n                <p>Momentum from both teams quickly picked up in the first five minutes as the fast play led to a Nicole Hall cross-checking penalty as she crashed into the boards. However, the Penn State penalty kill unit stood tall.</p>\n                <p>After an unsuccessful power play, a quick two-on-one opportunity developed behind the Penn State defense as Rylee McLeod fed Heidi Knoll a smooth pass under the defenseman's stick that found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>The opening first 10 minutes of the middle frame consisted of scoring chances seen on both sides of the ice, which seemed to slow down as time bled off the clock. Outwater nearly scored her second of the game as she was in close on Drabyk, ultimately having her wrist shot attempt shut down.</p>\n                <p>A much different second period concluded with Penn State having possession as time ran out, leaving the score at 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Syracuse had the first quality chance in the third period as Jordan Blouin had a chance backdoor to put one behind Campbell, ultimately denied by the left pad.</p>\n                <p>The freshman made 13 saves in her sixth career start.</p>\n                <p>The insurance goal for Penn State came off the stick of Kendall Butze as she sent a wrist shot from the top of the faceoff circle that found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>A late power play paired with an empty net posed a challenge for Penn State as the game reached its three-minute mark.</p>\n                <p>Janecke didn\u2019t take long to step up to the challenge as she sent the puck down from center ice, slowly reaching the vacant net.</p>\n                <p>Campbell spent the remaining two minutes of the game fending off any chance the Orange could generate, continuing to show promise in place of DeSa.</p>\n                <p>Penn State found itself back on track with a 4-1 score as the horn sounded.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Both teams return to Tennity Ice Pavilion for Game 2 of the final series between the two sides with puck drop at 3 p.m.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Katie DeSa was not listed on the lineup for the fourth-straight game with an undisclosed injury.

    "author": "Emma Lessick | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Beyond kick splits, makeup and dance lies dedication, discipline and the true heart of a Penn State Lionette.</p>\n                <p>Abby O\u2019Shea spent her senior year as a teammate, friend and captain of the 2025 Penn State Lionettes dance team.</p>\n                <p>For O\u2019Shea, a fourth-year studying finance, her dream of dancing in Beaver Stadium began early.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI started dancing when I was 3 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cLike every other girl, I took ballet classes.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As a child, O\u2019Shea also played soccer, but it wasn\u2019t long before she swapped her cleats for ballet slippers. By the time she reached high school, her heart was set on becoming a Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>But her journey hasn\u2019t been without sacrifice.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAny sport or commitment you pour so much into can get really tiring,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hours, and they definitely pay off, but especially during nationals season, it can be tough.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Beyond their regular football season commitments, the Lionettes prepare for their biggest annual challenge, the Universal Dance Association National Championships (UDA Nationals). In 2024, the Lionettes placed third in the Division 1A pom category.</p>\n                <p>Each January, the team travels to Florida to compete against the nation\u2019s top collegiate dance teams \u2014 a feat made more difficult this year after Penn State cut the Lionettes\u2019 funding, leaving the team to raise tens of thousands of dollars themselves to fund their trip to UDA Nationals, which will kick off on Friday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy teammates and I were deeply disappointed and also a little frustrated by the situation,\" O\u2019Shea said. \"We don\u2019t ask for much, so it was tough to learn that our dance \u2018Super Bowl\u2019 would have to be financed entirely through our own fundraising efforts.\"</p>\n                <p>After the Lionettes spoke out about the challenge they were facing, the team received more support than they anticipated.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe Penn State community\u2019s response has been overwhelming. I never expected to receive such an outpouring of love and support from students, community members, alumni and donors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had no idea how many silent supporters were cheering us on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As college dancers, the Lionettes team has only one major competition each year and two minutes on stage for each style of dance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat makes every moment, every sacrifice and every dollar matter,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.</p>\n                <p>For as long as O\u2019Shea can remember, she\u2019s dreamed of performing on the national stage. With the financial challenges the team has faced, she said this year\u2019s competition has become even more special.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe dedicate hundreds of hours of practice to our season so that we can step onto that stage with confidence and represent Penn State with heart and pride,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cBeing able to bring that passion to life on the UDA stage and share it with the world is our ultimate goal.\u201d</p>\n                <p>O\u2019Shea's teammates and coach see her not only as a dancer but as a leader. Nikki Romano, co-captain of the Lionettes, describes the team as \u201cdedicated, passionate and hardworking,\u201d and said O\u2019Shea embodies those qualities.</p>\n                <p>Lionettes head coach Jackie Hovis also spoke highly of her leadership.</p>\n                <p>\u201cUnderclassmen look up to her when she teaches something, and she\u2019s a great example. She really shines when it comes to details. I will turn to her and she always knows.\u201d Hovis said, \u201cAll of these kids on the team right now will never forget her leadership.\u201d</p>\n                <p>O\u2019Shea's presence has left a mark; a Lionette legacy.</p>\n                <p>As O\u2019Shea enters her last UDA Nationals competition, she recognizes just how incredibly fortunate and grateful she is to dance on the UDA Nationals stage one last time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe bring unmatched passion, work ethic and selflessness to representing this university, often without the recognition or resources that other athletic teams receive,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cWitnessing the community come together in this way has been incredible, and I hope everyone knows just how grateful my teammates and I truly are.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Her Lionette journey has been defined by resilience and community, leaving a blueprint for those who follow in her footsteps.</p>\n                <p>\u201c\u2018Lionette will always be my favorite title, and one I am incredibly proud to hold,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.</p>\n                <p>MORE SPORTS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Following a 24-point loss to No.14 Ohio State on Wednesday night, Penn State women\u2019s basketball has now lost its last seven games and is still in search of a Big Ten win. It\u2019s been a tough stretch for the Lady Lions as they\u2019ve faced four ranked opponents, along with one receiving votes, during this skid.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white\u2019s next competitor looks a little different. Penn State welcomes Rutgers, which is also winless in conference play, to Rec Hall at 1 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Aside from the fact that someone will get their first Big Ten win of the season, there\u2019s another story to look out for in Sunday's matinee. It\u2019ll be Penn State\u2019s star guard Kiyomi McMiller\u2019s first game against her former team.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions allow more points per game than any other team in the Big Ten, at 82.4. Having said that, the Scarlet Knights have the conference\u2019s lowest points per game average at 58.6. Penn State averages 75.9 points, about 13 more than Rutgers typically allows.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s leading scorer is 6-foot-6 center Gracie Merkle, who\u2019s coming off back-to-back 20-plus point games. The Mount Washington, Kentucky native averages 19.2 points per game and owns a nation leading 75.5% field-goal percentage.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights\u2019 go-to also comes from the front court through 6-foot-1 forward Nene Ndiaye. The junior Boston College transfer averages 14.7 points per game, but does a little bit of everything for Rutgers. Ndiaye also leads the team in steals, is second in three-point shooting and rebounding, and third in assists.</p>\n                <p>Given Ndiaye\u2019s versatility, rather than Merkle, a better comparison to her on Penn State\u2019s squad is the former Scarlet Knight McMiller.</p>\n                <p>The 5-foot-8 sophomore is the Lady Lions\u2019 second leading scorer at 18.9 points per game. In the blue and white\u2019s last outing against Ohio State, McMiller scored 20 points, while also tallying seven assists and four rebounds.</p>\n                <p>McMiller leads Penn State in assists and is second on the team in steals and rebounds, but the Silver Spring, Maryland, native also turned the ball over 82 times, which is the most in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>McMiller has to match veteran guards Faith Blackstone and Kaylah Ivey, who weren\u2019t there for McMiller\u2019s lone year at Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>Blackstone averages 10 points per game, but has only made 11 appearances for the Scarlet Knights this season. Ivey averages eight points per game, but has a much bigger presence on the floor.</p>\n                <p>Ivey transferred from Boston College with Ndiaye and has been Rutgers\u2019 number one passer. The 5-foot-8 graduate student leads the Scarlet Knights with 61 assists and averages 8 points per game. Ivey also got things done on the defensive end with 23 steals on the season.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions\u2019 scoring trio rounds out with 5-foot-8 guard Moriah Murray, who averages 10.6 points per game. The junior was Penn State\u2019s leading scorer on Wednesday night with 25 points, and she shot 8-for-17 from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>In Sunday's matchup, the blue and white will have an opportunity to snap its seven-game skid, defend its home floor and finally break through in conference play. The Lady Lions have a chance to regain momentum and reset the trajectory of their season, but it won\u2019t be easy because Rutgers has the same goal.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State has its most anticipated matchup of the season on Friday, as the Nittany Lions will hit the road to face Iowa at Carver-Hawkeye Arena. This was the location that the squad last lost at back in 2020.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is trying to continue its historic win streak, but will have a few matches that are looked at as an uphill battle.</p>\n                <p>A pair of wrestlers met with the media on Wednesday and offered insight ahead of the dual.</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl</p>\n                <p>At 125 pounds, Luke Lilledahl will face Dean Peterson. Last season, Lilledahl lost to Peterson, 4-1, when Peterson was at Rutgers before transferring to Iowa.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI would say there\u2019s definitely a couple things that I learned just feeling guys out and wrestling, but most of the time it's a clean slate every match,\u201d Lilledahl said. \u201cEvery match starts 0-0, so just another opportunity.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl has the opportunity to defeat an opponent that he\u2019s never had his arm raised against. The sophomore discussed his new mindset going into the match.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like last season was kind of more about showing people my potential just because people had a lot of high expectations for me,\u201d Lilledahl said. \u201cThis year I feel like it\u2019s more like just going out there and dominating these days and kind of putting myself at the top of the weight class.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl has a solid start with a record of 9-0 so far this season.</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola</p>\n                <p>Another match to watch for Penn State is at heavyweight. Cole Mirasola will take on Ben Kueter, who like Mirasola, is also considered a smaller heavyweight. Going into this match Mirasola is on a win streak and will try to upset a top-five wrestler.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get better every match and get ready for Big Tens and nationals,\u201d Mirasola said.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola went 1-2 in Big Ten duals last season with losses coming to Nick Feldman of Ohio State and Luke Luffman of Illinois. The redshirt freshman is another wrestler that seems to have a different mindset than last season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like in the past I haven\u2019t really been like super mean when I wrestle, just kind of tactical and slick, but just talking to coach Cael (Sanderson) you always have to be clean,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cYou can win dirty, like not being dirty, like winning off a go behind or pulling guys down and stuff, focusing on being neat.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Being a smaller heavyweight, Mirasola has to use other skills to take advantage of his opponent. This includes quickness and being technical about when they\u2019re going for the takedown.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can really wrestle me for the whole seven minutes. So, if I use my conditioning as a factor, I think that\u2019ll help for sure,\u201d Mirasola said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Bryce Jordan Center (BJC) was awash with purple light on Thursday evening as members of the Penn State and State College communities came together to attend the 51st annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. memorial banquet.</p>\n                <p>The banquet, which was hosted by the Forum On Black Affairs (FOBA), is one of several January events meant to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his legacy.</p>\n                <p>Stephanie Preston, MLK banquet chair and former FOBA president, said she has had a long history of both attending, and later organizing, the banquet.</p>\n                <p>She said the event\u2019s theme of \u201cundaunted hope\u201d was chosen by the MLK Commemoration Student Committee, which FOBA then adopted.</p>\n                <p>Preston said the biggest challenge the banquet faced has been finding a large enough space to hold the event. Previously, former FOBA President Carlos Wiley moved the banquet from the Penn Stater to the BJC.</p>\n                <p>The banquet began at 6:10 p.m. with a call to order from Preston followed by speeches from Executive Vice President and Provost Fotis Sotiropoulos, Paul Robeson Cultural Center Director Evan Williams and Dean of J. Jeffrey and Ann Marie Fox Graduate School and Vice Provost for Graduate Education Levon Esters.</p>\n                <p>A blessing was given by Gary Abdullah, the assistant dean for diversity and inclusion for the Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications, followed by performances from the Essence of Joy choral ensemble and spoken word artivist Sir Dominique Jordan.</p>\n                <p>Williams, a member of FOBA, said he was pleased to see the banquet occur once again. He said he hoped attendees of the banquet left with a sense of need to come together to settle differences amongst themselves.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSometimes we have to crawl before we can walk and we're going to have our differences but oftentimes we have to understand the similarities and allow that to be at the forefront,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe may not agree on certain things, but we can agree to disagree respectfully and I think, in this current climate that we are in, this program and the messages that will be spoken tonight will be able to have a billowing effect of positivity and help make a paradigm shift in the right path that we need to go as a community.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kenyatta Shelton-Burleigh, the assistant director for the admissions strategic partnerships office in undergraduate admissions, said the banquet has been a staple of her time at Penn State and she always makes an effort to attend.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe still, as Americans, have a job to do to keep the fight going for equality, and being here at Penn State, what I love is that in the light of everything that's going on in today's world, Penn State is still standing strong on being equitable,\u201d Shelton-Burleigh said.</p>\n                <p>Preston and Williams announced Jamie Campbell as the recipient of the Humanitarian Service Award and Gyasi Franklin, a second-year studying film production, and Deja Workman, a PhD student studying informatics, the recipients of Fannie Lou Hamer \u2013 W.E.B. DuBois Service Scholarships.</p>\n                <p>The banquet concluded at 8:15 p.m. following a final performance by the United Christian Campus Ministry Choir and closing remarks from Preston.</p>\n                <p>Gopal Balachandran, a member of the State College Borough Council, said it was \u201cfantastic\u201d that the speakers and performers selected for the banquet were able to contribute to the event\u2019s theme.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe fact of the matter is that all of the speakers and all of the stories building around this theme, particularly in a part where many of the speakers acknowledge how hard it's been in the past year,\u201d Balachandran said. \u201cTo be able to give a message that is consistent with Dr. Martin Luther King but is both uplifting and full of hope, but doesn't lose sight of the fact of how much work and how much fighting still needs to be done, so I thought it was a great message for a great time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said he hoped the banquet would leave attendees hopeful for solutions to overcome current issues in American society and around the world.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're living in a difficult time,\u201d Balachandran said. \u201cThere are a great deal of challenges and stresses all around and what is really hopeful to me is that these are struggles that have occurred many times in our shared history and that there's still a way and a path forward and that we can still do that with our heads raised high and open our hearts.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>There\u2019s something about the new year that makes it feel like everyone suddenly needs to get their life together.</p>\n                <p>All at once, it\u2019s new routines, new goals and trying to become the \u201cbest version\u201d of yourself \u2014 even though most people are still just getting back into the semester and double-checking where their classes are.</p>\n                <p>A glow-up doesn\u2019t have to be extreme. You don\u2019t need a crazy early alarm or some perfect system to change your life. Usually, it\u2019s just small things that make everyday college life feel easier.</p>\n                <p>Start small with your routine</p>\n                <p>One of the easiest places to start is your routine. You don\u2019t have to overhaul your entire schedule \u2014 just start small. Trying to change everything at once usually doesn\u2019t stick, especially once classes get busy.</p>\n                <p>Going to bed earlier, eating something before your first class or finally using an alarm you won\u2019t snooze ten times can make your day feel way less chaotic. Even one of those changes helps you feel a little more on top of things.</p>\n                <p>Clean up your space (even a little)</p>\n                <p>When your room is a mess, everything feels harder \u2014 papers on your desk, cups you forgot about, clothes on the floor that have been there way too long \u2014 it adds up fast.</p>\n                <p>You don\u2019t need to clean your whole room. Clean off your desk, your backpack or even your phone if you\u2019re feeling productive. It doesn\u2019t fix everything, but it helps your space feel less chaotic.</p>\n                <p>Movement that actually feels doable</p>\n                <p>Being active doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. You don\u2019t need hard workouts or gym motivation. Some days it\u2019s just walking to class, stretching a little or pacing around your room.</p>\n                <p>Going with a friend helps too. Trying classes together or just meeting up makes it feel more like hanging out than working out.</p>\n                <p>You can complain the whole time, laugh about not knowing what you\u2019re doing and leave early if you want. It just feels like a break from sitting around all day, which is kind of the point.</p>\n                <p>Rethink the way you choose your daily outfits</p>\n                <p>Let\u2019s be honest \u2014 most of us wear the same few outfits every week. A glow-up doesn\u2019t mean changing that, it just means liking those outfits.</p>\n                <p>A good hoodie, jeans that don\u2019t feel awful and sneakers that go with everything can make even low-effort days feel better.</p>\n                <p>When you actually feel comfortable in what you\u2019re wearing, you\u2019re not constantly thinking about it throughout the day. You can actually focus on class, run errands or just get through a long day on campus.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not about looking dressed up \u2014 it\u2019s about feeling like yourself, even on days when you\u2019re putting in the bare minimum.</p>\n                <p>Take your mental health seriously</p>\n                <p>The beginning of second semester is rough. It gets dark early, everyone\u2019s tired and it feels like there\u2019s always something you should be doing.</p>\n                <p>Taking care of your mental health sometimes just means stopping for a second. Skipping plans, logging off or even sitting in your room doing nothing without turning it into a whole guilt spiral. You don\u2019t have to push through everything.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s okay to slow down when things feel overwhelming. A glow-up isn\u2019t just about looks \u2014 it\u2019s taking care of yourself when you need to. Instead of big goals, think about how you want to feel this year. Less stressed, more balanced or just better overall.</p>\n                <p>Focus on how you want to feel</p>\n                <p>Instead of putting pressure on yourself with big resolutions, it helps to think about how you want to feel this year. Maybe that\u2019s more balanced, less stressed or more confident.</p>\n                <p>Let whatever habits you pick support that instead of making your life harder. You don\u2019t need to do everything \u201cright\u201d or have it all figured out \u2014 just do what actually works for you and your schedule.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Now in the midst of a four-game losing streak, Penn State fell to 9-8 on the year and 0-6 in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are one game ahead of Northwestern and two games ahead of Maryland, both of which are also winless in conference play. All three sit tied for last in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Oregon\u2019s 1-5 Big Ten record is the only thing keeping it above the blue and white in the standings, as the Ducks sit at 8-9 overall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State heads about 200 miles south on Sunday to take on the Terrapins at the XFINITY Center. Tipoff is scheduled for noon.</p>\n                <p>Something\u2019s gotta give come Sunday as Maryland\u2019s also dropped its last four-in-a-row. The Terrapins suffered quality losses against Virginia, Michigan, Alabama and Gonzaga. Three of four of those losses were blowouts, however.</p>\n                <p>Maryland\u2019s leading scorer, Pharrel Payne, hasn\u2019t played since the Terrapins\u2019 Dec. 13 game against Michigan. He enters as questionable with a leg injury. Payne averaged 17.5 points and 7.2 rebounds per game when available.</p>\n                <p>The injury bug is going around, though, as Penn State also arrives in College Park without some of its key players.</p>\n                <p>Nittany Lion standout freshman Kayden Mingo sustained a broken nose in practice and will \u201cbe out for a while,\u201d and Tibor Mirti\u010d also enters questionable, with a knee injury that he\u2019s \u201cjust rehabbing,\u201d as both described by Mike Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>In Penn State\u2019s most recent loss to UCLA, Freddie Dilione V sustained an ankle injury and is questionable against Maryland, though he\u2019ll most likely be sidelined, as Rhoades detailed it was a sprain.</p>\n                <p>With Payne\u2019s injury, Maryland\u2019s points leader is David \u201cDiggy\u201d Coit, who averages 13.8 points per game. The 5-foot-11 guard enters fresh off a 30 point performance in the Terrapins\u2019 recent loss to USC.</p>\n                <p>That was his third 30-plus point performance of the season. He dropped 41 against Mount St. Mary back in November.</p>\n                <p>Despite Mingo\u2019s injury sidelining him for the last three games, he still leads Penn State in scoring, behind his 14.9 points per game average as a freshman. With Dilione V likely being out against Maryland, the blue and white\u2019s leading scorer against the Terrapins will be Melih Tunca.</p>\n                <p>Tunca averages 10.1 points per game and only recorded five points in the loss to UCLA.</p>\n                <p>Dominick Stewart led the way against the Bruins, dropping 16 points \u2013 the most of any Nittany Lion. He likely sees a tremendous amount of playing time against Maryland as one of just three healthy guards.</p>\n                <p>Penn State averages 78.1 points per game as a team, while the Terrapins average 73.2, though the Nittany Lions' defense surrenders 75.4 points per game.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white is 4-8 in games when it allows opponents to score 70-plus points. Maryland has been stopped short of 70-plus points in just six games this season.</p>\n                <p>Prior to the 2025-26 season, the Big Ten announced that all 18 teams would make the conference tournament after the regular season, up from 15. Despite that, this still feels like a must-win game for both teams, as each is desperate for its first conference win.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Julia Frederick | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>To my fellow spring 2026 graduates, welcome to your last semester of undergrad.</p>\n                <p>If you\u2019re anything like me, the thought of graduation has always seemed like this far-off, almost make-believe thing. It\u2019ll happen eventually, but not for a while.</p>\n                <p>Well, a few years have sprinted by and now you\u2019re getting emails from your academic advisor to apply for graduation on LionPATH, pressure from your mom to order your cap and gown and crossing your fingers that your family found a place to stay come May.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Spring 2026 holds a lot of lasts. Last first day of class. Last night out at the bar with your friends. Last moment before you enter the big, scary \u201creal world.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The finish line is approaching rapidly. Are you ready?</p>\n                <p>If you aren\u2019t, you\u2019re certainly not alone. Big transitions like this carry a lot of emotion. You might feel excited, scared, uncertain or all of the above.</p>\n                <p>However you\u2019re feeling, allow me to share some advice that I\u2019ve found to be helpful.</p>\n                <p>Tip 1: This is not the first big change you\u2019ve faced</p>\n                <p>\u201cAnticipatory anxiety\u201d is something that can surface as graduation approaches, according to the American Psychological Association (APA).</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. It\u2019s \u201cworry about the future\u201d and \u201cthe fear that bad things might happen or that you might become unable to successfully accomplish what you set out to do,\u201d as the Anxiety and Depression Association of America defines it.</p>\n                <p>The APA points to looking at one\u2019s history to alleviate these feelings.</p>\n                <p>Thus, I encourage you to think back to graduating high school all those years ago. Remember the feeling of being freshly 18 with the world at your fingertips and the uncertainty of what was in store for you.</p>\n                <p>Remember the drive to University Park and the teary family goodbyes. Remember your first-year dorm, roommate and classes. Remember your first lecture hall in the Forum or Thomas, thinking to yourself, \u201cHow can there be so many people here?\u201d</p>\n                <p>It all felt so overwhelming at the time, didn\u2019t it?</p>\n                <p>Look at you now. You came out the other side. You not only did the hard thing, but you thrived while doing so.</p>\n                <p>It all worked out then; there\u2019s no reason to doubt that it will now, too.</p>\n                <p>Tip 2: You\u2019re not the first and you won\u2019t be the last</p>\n                <p>Penn State has over 800,000 alumni. That means that over 800,000 people have gone through the exact same thing. All of this goes to say that you aren\u2019t alone.</p>\n                <p>While of course, graduation may be bittersweet, you\u2019ll join something bigger than yourself and the current campus population. Penn State has one of the largest alumni networks in the U.S.; you\u2019re in good company.</p>\n                <p>While your time as a student at Penn State may be over, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never come back. Happy Valley has a way of welcoming past-students back home.</p>\n                <p>You took great care of Penn State while you were here, it\u2019s time to pass it on to the next incoming class.</p>\n                <p>Tip 3: Make the most of it</p>\n                <p>To bring in one of my 2026 New Year\u2019s resolutions, say yes to as much as you can (within reason, of course).</p>\n                <p>Do that bar crawl, see that movie, stay out late. Do everything you wanted to do when you came here, plus a few extra things.</p>\n                <p>Graduate with no regrets \u2026 OK, maybe a few (WITHIN REASON).</p>\n                <p>Leave with college years well-lived, whatever that means to you. Be proud of where you came from, but keep moving forward. Penn State will always cheer you on.</p>\n                <p>You\u2019re off to your next big adventure. Congratulations on what you\u2019ve accomplished.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State kept its winning streak alive with its third straight win of the 2026 season on Thursday. It swept St. Thomas Aquinas 3-0, taking home another victory from Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>The first set started with back-and-forth scoring from both sides. For every point scored by the Nittany Lions, the Spartans responded immediately, keeping the first few points close.</p>\n                <p>After keeping the set neck-and-neck, the blue and white finally pulled away with a block from Sean Harvey, making the score 11-8.</p>\n                <p>But St. Thomas Aquinas was able to get it close again after a few blocks and quick points, diminishing the blue and white\u2019s lead to 11-10.</p>\n                <p>After a big kill from Penn State\u2019s Gaige Gabriel, the blue and white started to pull ahead, making its lead 13-10. The 6-foot-8 sophomore then went on to deliver an ace, increasing the blue and white\u2019s lead to 14-10.</p>\n                <p>A kill from Penn State\u2019s Owen Rose tallied its third point in a row, forcing the Spartans to take their first timeout of the match. Following the break, the Spartans were able to score three quick points and tighten the game back up.</p>\n                <p>After a play being challenged by the blue and white, however, it continued to pull away, setting the score at 18-13.</p>\n                <p>After some brief back-and-forth, a service error from the Spartans made the score 25-19, giving Penn State a win in the first set.</p>\n                <p>Going into the second set, the pattern seemed to continue, with the first few points being back-and-forth on both sides of the court.</p>\n                <p>However, after two big kills, one from Gabriel and another from Matthew Luoma, the blue and white pulled ahead, making the score 8-5.</p>\n                <p>However, after a few errors on the Penn State side, the Spartans were able to close the lead to 11-10. And just like that, it was back-and-forth scoring, with the score staying within two points for the next few points.</p>\n                <p>After a kill from Harvey, the Nittany Lions took the lead by three points, making the score 19-16. But the Spartans were quick to respond and close that gap. But it was Harvey again who got another big kill and put the blue and white back up.</p>\n                <p>Rose\u2019s sixth kill of the game put the Nittany Lions up 22-18. From there, the rest was history. A kill from Luoma got Penn State the win in the second set, 25-20.</p>\n                <p>The third set started with two quick points from St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was quick to respond, however, and went on a five-point streak. After a kill from Gabriel, back-to-back aces from Harvey, a Spartans\u2019 block error and a kill from Harvey, it took the lead 5-2.</p>\n                <p>After some back-and-forth, redshirt freshman Jaidyn Bethel logged his second kill of the match to make the score 10-6. From there, the blue and white seemed to run away with it a bit, as Gabriel logged his ninth kill, making the score 13-7.</p>\n                <p>After another Harvey kill, his ninth of the night, Penn State increased its lead to 16-7, leading by more than double.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took the remainder of the set with ease. Freshman Tristan Hassell logged his first kill of the match to make the score 22-12.</p>\n                <p>While they managed to score a few more points in the set, the lead was too great for the Spartans to close. The blue and white won its third straight set after a service error from the opposite side of the court.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will continue their homestand as they face Lewis at 7 p.m. Saturday in Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

With an overall record of 4-15-1, the Fighting Irish are winless in conference play and sit at the bottom of the Big Ten standings.</p>\n                <p>Notre Dame\u2019s averages of 2.55 goals per game and 4.25 goals allowed both rank last in the Big Ten; however, its special teams have performed well, with a conference-third-best power-play percentage and a second-best penalty kill percentage.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Irish are led by defenseman Paul Fischer, who has five goals and 11 assists on the season, but the junior will miss out on this weekend\u2019s action after being assessed a suspension for a checking penalty in last weekend\u2019s contest.</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and Notre Dame sit at No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, in the NCAA in penalty minutes per game, setting up a likely physical series.</p>\n                <p>In net for the Fighting Irish is sophomore Nicholas Kempf, who recently wrapped up a World Junior Championship campaign with Team USA. The Washington Capitals prospect has an .887 save percentage on the season, while allowing 65 goals.</p>\n                <p>Penn State injuries loom</p>\n                <p>While the addition of both Aiden Fink and Cade Christenson back into the Penn State lineup after the holiday break has been an added boost, the home team sustained multiple injuries after last weekend\u2019s sweep of Minnesota, which could impact the upcoming series.</p>\n                <p>Shortly after recording his first goal of the season in the Nittany Lions\u2019 5-2 win over Minnesota on Saturday, sophomore Braedon Ford collided awkwardly with the boards and left the ice in visible pain.</p>\n                <p>Coach Guy Gadowsky announced the forward would be \u201cout for a significant amount of time with a lower-body injury.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A big question mark for this weekend is the status of the blue and white\u2019s point leader, Charlie Cerrato, after he exited Friday\u2019s contest early and was scratched the following night.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky announced Cerrato, along with Casey Aman and Shea Van Olm, are all \u201cday-to-day,\u201d leaving open the possibility of the three returning to the lineup, although the likelihood is unclear.</p>\n                <p>Goaltending tandem</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have stuck with its rotational strategy of alternating goaltenders Josh Fleming and Kevin Reidler. The strategy has largely worked out, with both having solid seasons, keeping the option open for either of them to compete on a given night.</p>\n                <p>Fleming holds the slight edge over Reidler, although with two fewer appearances, tallying a 93.8 save percentage to Reidler\u2019s 91.1.</p>\n                <p>Fleming is impressing in the midst of his freshman season, recently being named to the Mike Richter Award watch list, an award given annually to the top goaltender in NCAA men\u2019s Division I hockey. His save percentage is tied for first nationally, and his 1.91 goals against average is tied for seventh.</p>\n                <p>Reidler is also in his first season with the Nittany Lions, transferring in after spending his first season with Nebraska Omaha, and has helped the team to 11 wins so far through the season.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Veronica Figg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A new spot for stir-frys, salads and honey-based desserts recently opened it\u2019s doors in State College. The Philadelphia-based restaurant chain Honeygrow is now located at 160 E Beaver Ave from 10:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.</p>\n                <p>This week, I decided to go and try some of the new spot\u2019s options, and to find a dish that might \u201cwok\u201d your world.</p>\n                <p>Stir-Fry</p>\n                <p>I chose to order Honeygrow\u2019s seasonal Miso Garlic stir-fry noodles. The dish includes egg white noodles, roasted chicken, miso corn, caramelized onions, shaved parmesan, chives and Umami miso sauce. I chose to remove the shaved parmesan.</p>\n                <p>The dish was very good and had a great Umami profile. The noodles were cooked perfectly \u2014 not too soft or soggy from the sauce.</p>\n                <p>The chicken was juicy and was not dry at all. The Umami profile came into play when the sauce mixed with the individual flavors of the chicken, corn and onions, making them a powerful combination.</p>\n                <p>The caramelized onions were tangy and crunchy, giving a needed sharpness to the sweet corn. The noodles, corn and onions together created a rich, tangy and sweet balance that \u2014 when mixed with the chicken \u2014 created the Umami flavor the dish strives for, tasting savory and comforting.</p>\n                <p>The chives were sprinkled on top and I mixed them in to add to the flavor profile. Unfortunately, the taste of the chives was overpowered by the garlic in the sauce.</p>\n                <p>I would have liked to have tasted the chives more clearly so they could have added some more tang to the dish.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Dessert</p>\n                <p>I ordered a create-your-own Honeybar for dessert, and chose clover honey, apples, grapes, blueberries, strawberries and granola as my toppings.</p>\n                <p>This dessert was delicious. I ate the whole thing and would really recommend it.</p>\n                <p>Clover honey is sweet and was the highlight of the dessert. It made the multiple flavors of the fruits really pop.</p>\n                <p>The granola was crunchy and a great juxtaposition for the sweetness of the strawberries and tanginess of the blueberries, making for a great flavor combination.</p>\n                <p>The grapes were a great addition to the dessert that added a unique flavor which complimented the other fruits.</p>\n                <p>The apples were crunchy and sweet, and \u2014 when paired with the grapes \u2014 went great with the honey. All of the fruits tasted fresh and no part of the dessert was dry.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 10/10</p>\n                <p>Veronica\u2019s Food Sensitivity Corner</p>\n                <p>As a student who was recently diagnosed with a dairy sensitivity, I am always on the lookout for foods that fit my new dietary needs and am aware there are other students who may have similar needs as well.</p>\n                <p>Honeygrow does offer vegan dishes like the Red Coconut Curry Stir-Fry, or Gluten-free items on their menu including the Loaded Greek Salad and OG Cobb Salad.</p>\n                <p>At Honeygrow, all dishes on the menu can be modified to remove ingredients, and you can also create your own stir-fry, salad or honeybar and customize it.</p>\n                <p>As with any food establishment, please inform a service worker if you have any food allergies.</p>\n                <p>Overall, I would recommend Honeygrow to anyone who misses a home-cooked meal of the noodle variety, and for any student that needs a sweet treat after a long day of classes.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>It\u2019s a random Wednesday during the frigid January winter in Happy Valley. You step out of your class building and get hit with a gust of wind to the face followed by a trek through the flurry of snow to the library under an endlessly grey sky.</p>\n                <p>The sun becomes a celebrity \u2014 making rare and treasured appearances. In times like these, it\u2019s best to put on some headphones, crank up some music and escape the seasonal depression for a few brief minutes.</p>\n                <p>Here are some tunes to play to get you through the day and put a little more pep in your step as you hunker through the winter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLike A Rolling Stone\u201d by Bob Dylan</p>\n                <p>Arguably Dylan\u2019s biggest hit of his career, \u201cLike A Rolling Stone\u201d is a bitter sweet story about a once-rich woman who loses everything and finds herself \u2014 as Dylan would put it \u2014 rolling through life like a stone.</p>\n                <p>Sure, a bummer topic for a song, but the production, ensemble and groovy tempo of it make you want to shake into a dance no matter where you\u2019re walking. A fitting song for a gloomy mood as the juxtaposition of the lyrics and the production of the track make for a comedically ironic vibe that is sure to boost your spirits.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDrive\u201d by Incubus</p>\n                <p>Incubus\u2019 \u201cDrive\u201d is a much slower tune, but the true uplifting power comes from the lyrics. A fabulous song about regaining control of your life and finding the empowerment behind that act.</p>\n                <p>Lead singer Brandon Boyd lays a blanket of warmth over your soul as he belts out the lyrics to the chorus, \u201cwhatever tomorrow brings, I\u2019ll be there, with open arms and open eyes.\u201d Best played on the bus or car ride home after a long day, \u201cDrive\u201d will give you a comforting sense of security in yourself to keep pushing through the dreary days of winter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d by Prince</p>\n                <p>Switching tracks and putting you in a free and easy mood is the iconic opener to Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain\u201d album, \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d This killer track opens with a monologue from the eccentric lead singer, talking about \u201cthe afterworld, a world of never-ending happiness.\u201d In this world, \u201cyou can always see the sun, day or night.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The true message of this song is simply, if the world is bringing you down, just let loose and find a way to have a good time \u2014 ignore everything else and just be alive. The snow and the wind won\u2019t stand a chance to bring you down with this tune bumping between your ears.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSweater Weather\u201d by The Neighbourhood</p>\n                <p>An early 2010\u2019s hit where the music alone immediately throws you back to the wonderful winter days of elementary school, while keeping you in the present to take a moment to appreciate how many winters have passed and how you\u2019ve survived all of them.</p>\n                <p>A truly creative and embracing song on all levels that carries the vibe of a gloomy winter night to help you embrace \u2014 yes \u2014 the sweater weather. Layered on top of that is a lyrical composition that will also take your mind away from whatever it is that has you down that day, as you hear a tale of two lovers cherishing each other during a similarly rough patch.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d by The Black Eyed Peas</p>\n                <p>Rounding out this list is a pure nostalgia hit for anyone working through their years at State College. \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d is sure to remind you of the upcoming good vibes of spring and summer that lay ahead.</p>\n                <p>This 2000\u2019s radio banger exudes positivity, enthusiasm and eager excitment, with the trio preaching, \u201ctonight\u2019s gonna be a good night,\u201d and just like with Incubus\u2019 \u201cDrive,\u201d you truly feel that sense of confidence in the thought tonight will in fact be a good night, no matter the blizzards of assignments you have to go through.</p>\n                <p>Lyrics aside, the production on this track just puts you in a party mood \u2014 wanting to bust out dancing and grooving along to the fun and energetic tune. A choice pick for the mid-day grind that will hit you like a double shot of espresso between the ears.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "author": "Sami Altmire | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State hits the road this Friday for an away meet, kicking off its Big Ten schedule, taking on Illinois. The Nittany Lions were in Rec Hall this past Sunday and tested the waters by testing various rotation lineups against Yale, which proved successful and resulted in a win.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions rank well entering week 2, obtaining the No. 17 spot, while the Fighting Illini hold the No. 35 spot. Illinois finished second in the Border Battle Quad Meet, coming in close to first-place, Iowa.</p>\n                <p>Penn State looks confident in its ability to secure some big points right off the bat, with a slew of well-rounded talent to play around with. Penn State brought in an arsenal of new talent this season, and it can begin to move around.</p>\n                <p>Fresh faces like Kayla Bender, who excels on the balance beam, round out some of the struggles that the blue and white saw on the event last season. Freshman Lizzy Ryan could be a great addition as an all-around competitor, adding to the capabilities of Kalea McElligot and Elizabeth Leary, who were strong all-around athletes in the 2025 season.</p>\n                <p>The floor is looking like the event that will define this Fighting Illini and Nittany Lion meet, with 2025 season scores on the floor being high on both sides. Illinois enters the Big Ten season with high 9.800 scores for multiple athletes, with some reaching that 9.900 mark. Penn State is right up there with the Fighting Illini, with most of its roster scoring a high 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Vault appears to be a weak spot for Illinois, struggling to put up 2025 season high scores above 9.7500, and the rotation wasn't as successful as it had hoped during the Border Battle Quad Meet. The Nittany Lions put a heavy focus on vault, and they managed to get a good set of numbers after their rotation on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s meet with Yale showed Dani Latronica as a possibility for multiple events, starting off strong across vault, bar and beam. Ellie Monahan and Allison Kaempfer are both great options for the Nittany Lions to cover all their bases on Friday, with Monahan scoring well on beam and floor and Kaempfer holding it down on vault and bars.</p>\n                <p>As for the Fighting Illini, Chloe Cho showed out in their quad meet, scoring over 9.800 across the board. Bars also seem to be a focus for Illinois, with multiple 9.800 and higher scores after week one.</p>\n                <p>Mareli Muller is also a strong all-around athlete for the Fighting Illini, but she was missing from competition last week. If she joins the team again on Friday, she could be a really powerful aspect of the lineup. Being a great all-around gymnast, she can really excel and be a reason for the Nittany Lions to worry.</p>\n                <p>Illinois, similar to Penn State, has great depth and new talent entering the 2026 season, especially Callie Kauffman, a freshman who was a four-time level 10 regional qualifier and proved her abilities during week one.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The collegiate women\u2019s hockey world was stunned on Saturday afternoon, when No. 4 Penn State allowed a late tally followed by an overtime goal against Mercyhurst in its first conference loss of the season.</p>\n                <p>Continuing on their seven-game road trip, the Nittany Lions embark to Tennity Ice Pavilion in Syracuse, New York, to take on the Orange at 6 p.m Friday, and 3 p.m Saturday. The blue and white enter against Syracuse with a 19-4 overall record and 13-1 in the AHA. Meanwhile, the Orange are 12-11-3 overall and 8-6-2 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Head-to-Head</p>\n                <p>The last time these two teams squared off, the puck was nearly always on a Nittany Lions\u2019 stick.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white rode the offensive wave en route to an authoritative series sweep over the Orange, kicking off with a 7-0 victory in Game 1 before its history-making 11-2 punchline in Game 2. Penn State\u2019s 11 goals tied the program record for most goals in a single game.</p>\n                <p>Syracuse currently rides a four-game winning streak after stringing together consecutive sweeps over Delaware and Robert Morris. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions endured an upset in their previous outing against Mercyhurst.</p>\n                <p>Scouting the Orange</p>\n                <p>Syracuse is a difficult team to read. While they\u2019ve faced defeat to ranked and unranked teams alike, the Orange responded with close games and even found success in the shootout against a top-5 opponent.</p>\n                <p>On Nov. 25, Syracuse went the distance with then-No. 5 Cornell. The game was deadlocked at 2-2 and ended up decided in a shootout. Heidi Knoll and Nea Tervonen converted on their attempts, while goaltender Ava Drabyk was solid in net for a 2-0 shootout victory, despite the game officially registering as a draw nationally.</p>\n                <p>This contest wasn\u2019t the first time the Orange pulled off an extended-time victory, however. Four days before beating Cornell, Knoll dealt the same blow to Mercyhurst in a shootout, as well.</p>\n                <p>Outside of the shootout, Emma Gnade paces Syracuse\u2019s offense with eight goals and seven assists. Peyton Armstrong follows closely, with 13 points this season and Jackson Kinsler rounds out the top three with 12 points.</p>\n                <p>Senior Sami Gendron leads the defensive effort with 51 blocked shots, as well as contributing a goal and five assists while maintaining a zero plus-minus rating. Sophomore Jessica Cheung ranks second with 42 blocked shots, adding seven assists.</p>\n                <p>Drabyk\u2019s set to make her 24th start of the season between the pipes. The freshman netminder shows a 10-10-3 personal record, while boasting a .931 save percentage and 2.07 goals-against average.</p>\n                <p>Potential roster changes</p>\n                <p>Currently, Penn State has two players listed as members of their respective Olympic teams for the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games: Tessa Janecke for the United States and Nicole Hall for Sweden.</p>\n                <p>With the Games approaching, Janecke and Hall, two of Penn State\u2019s top performers, could be missing out on the Nittany Lions\u2019 closing act with the Orange this season.</p>\n                <p>Starting goaltender Katie DeSa didn\u2019t appear in either game against the Lakers last weekend, possibly due to an undisclosed injury, with no clear timeline on return. Freshman Maddy Campbell stepped into the starting role and has posted a .932 save percentage coupled with a 1.40 goals-against average so far through eight games.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Annie Gleba | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 2 Penn State travels to West Point, New York, to compete in the 2026 West Point Open. The two-day event begins this Friday. The Nittany Lions opened this season with a win over Army, 311.300-297.600, at Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>This event features competitors from levels 3 to 10 events and includes athletes from Penn State, Simpson, Navy, Springfield College, Army and William &amp; Mary. The first day consists of NCAA-level team competition, while the second day will host individual event finals for the top qualifiers from Friday\u2019s competition.</p>\n                <p>Last season at the West Point Open, Penn State finished second behind Ohio State, which will not return to the competition this year, with a team score of 237.800.</p>\n                <p>Simpson College</p>\n                <p>Simpson College is a Division III program that competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Simpson established its program and began to compete in the 2022-23 season. This means the Storm has never attended the West Point Open competition. They are the only NCAA school in Iowa to sponsor men\u2019s gymnastics and one of the few DIII programs nationwide.</p>\n                <p>Last season, they placed 6th in the ECAC Championship with a score of 299.600, and their all-around season average being 292.100.</p>\n                <p>Navy</p>\n                <p>Navy won its conference championship frequently in the last decade. The Midshipmen are a powerhouse within their conference and defeated Springfield College this season. Last year in the West Point Open, they placed third with a score of 309.500.</p>\n                <p>Despite losing the conference last year, Navy posted a 5-0 record. The name to watch from the Navy is Danilo Viciana. He was elected team captain this season and participated in the NCAA Championship Event Final.</p>\n                <p>Springfield College</p>\n                <p>Springfield College finished last place during last year's competition, just narrowly behind William &amp; Mary with 300.050 points. During the first meet of this season, the Pride placed about 1.5 points under Navy, 307.650-306.100. The Pride\u2019s roster contains gymnasts who previously qualified for individual finals in recent seasons, aiming to improve on their previous standing scores.</p>\n                <p>They will lean on players like Owen Carney, who qualified for individual finals in three different events in last year\u2019s West Point Open. The senior won the high bar event and placed second on the floor.</p>\n                <p>Army</p>\n                <p>Last year, Army won its conference, dethroning Navy's previous six-year streak and its first ECAC championship since 2015. Last season, Army placed 4th in the West Point Open, just slightly behind Navy with a score of 308.300.</p>\n                <p>After their conference win, the Black Knights went on to the NCAA Championships Qualifier, where they placed 10th.</p>\n                <p>William &amp; Mary</p>\n                <p>The Griffins placed 5th in the West Point Open last year with a score of 300.450. They had four individuals advance to event finals, with all competitors placing inside the top eight. One of William &amp; Mary\u2019s top competitors is Evan Wilkins.</p>\n                <p>His floor score against Springfield ranks as the nation's 10th-best mark in 2025, as well as earning all-ECAC on the floor after tying for third.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "No. 1 Penn State wrestling hits the road to face No. 4 Iowa",
    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>This Friday, Penn State faces their marquee opponent of the season so far, traveling to Carver Hawkeye Arena to face off against the Iowa Hawkeyes.</p>\n                <p>The venue is the last place the Nittany Lions lost a dual, nearly six years ago. Iowa will look to shock the world by handing the Nittany Lions another loss. However, recent controversies and some underperforming upperclassmen leave Penn State as a heavy favorite in this top-five matchup.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 2 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 6 Dean Peterson (UI)</p>\n                <p>This serves as a revenge match for Luke Lilledahl after Dean Peterson upset him, 4-1, at Rutgers last season.</p>\n                <p>Peterson is 7-1 in his senior year, but has no marquee victories under his belt to this point. This will be Lilledahl\u2019s highest-ranked matchup of the season so far.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 8 Drake Ayala (UI)</p>\n                <p>Drake Ayala is a two-time NCAA runner-up, but has taken a step back early this season with his record floating around the .500 line heading into a match with Blaze. For Blaze, this marks an opportunity to claim a victory over one of the most prestigious names in college wrestling, even during his down year.</p>\n                <p>Despite the record, Ayala is no cake walk. In the past two years, Ayala didn\u2019t drop more than five matches in a season. Blaze will have to use pure skill to outmatch the experience of Ayala.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 7 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 11 Nasir Bailey (UI)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis faces another big name talent having a relatively down year for the Hawkeyes, wrestling against former All-American and Pac-12 champion Nasir Bailey. Bailey\u2019s 9-3 record isn\u2019t bad, but he is nearing his loss total for previous years earlier in the season than usual.</p>\n                <p>For Davis, this is his biggest match since moving up to 141. Davis jumped into the top 10 immediately after returning to the lineup and will try to earn that ranking on Friday.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 17 Ryder Block (UI)</p>\n                <p>Ryder Block is in the midst of a breakout year after going 2-4 last season. Block is 6-2 in the early goings of his sophomore season but is 1-2 in ranked matches.</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness has been running through competition this season, and Block doesn\u2019t show the makings of an opponent that could upset the No. 1 at the weight class.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. No. 12 Jordan Williams (UI)</p>\n                <p>Jordan Williams is another highly touted transfer on Iowa\u2019s roster after coming in from Little Rock. He\u2019s 7-2 on the season for his new team, but is 0-2 against ranked opponents. This is the biggest matchup of the season so far for PJ Duke, going against the defending PAC-12 champion. Duke has been outscoring Williams on the year and is the favorite in this matchup.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs No. 3 Micheal Caliendo (UI)</p>\n                <p>This is a familiar matchup for both sides, as Michael Caliendo has faced Mitchell Mesenbrink six times over the last few years, with Mesenbrink winning each matchup. Each matchup has gotten closer, but it\u2019s clear Mesenbrink has Caliendo\u2019s number. This is expected to be a low-scoring affair as both wrestlers are patient and familiar with each other\u2019s styles.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs No. 3 Patrick Kennedy (UI)</p>\n                <p>Patrick Kennedy is in the midst of his most successful season in his senior year, starting out 9-1 and jumping into the top three. He is 3-1 against top-15 opponents, but Levi Haines is on a different level.</p>\n                <p>Haines is 3-0 against Kennedy in his career, with each win being decisive. Nothing has shifted to suggest this match will end much differently than those ones.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 4 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs No. 1 Angelo Ferrari (UI)</p>\n                <p>Angelo Ferrari was a highly touted prospect during his redshirt season last year. During one of his matches in the Bryce Jordan Center, Ferrari held former Nittany Lion Carter Starocci to one point. This season, his defense has defined his success, as he hasn\u2019t been taken down in a match this season. This is one of two matches where the Nittany Lion won\u2019t be the favorite.</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh has been consistent since joining the Nittany Lions, but hasn\u2019t been showing off the way Ferrari has this season. This will be a low-scoring match that may be decided by a single takedown or escape points.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. Gabe Arnold/ Harvey Ludington (UI)</p>\n                <p>With the dismissal of No. 4 Massoma Endene, there is uncertainty around who Josh Barr will face on Friday night. Gabe Arnold is a familiar name to Penn State fans and he has wrestled up to the weight class multiple times.</p>\n                <p>Harvey Ludington is on the verge of burning his redshirt, so the decision must be made to start him for the season, or yield to Arnold.</p>\n                <p>Barr has been dominant since returning to action in December, either wrestler will be challenged to compete with No. 1.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 13 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs No. 5 Ben Kueter (UI)</p>\n                <p>This is the second matchup in which the Hawkeye is favored. Kueter, a former Iowa football player, has continued to grow as Hawkeye heavyweight. He is 3-1 in limited action and viewed as a tier above Mirasola in terms of national championship contention.</p>\n                <p>This means Mirasola has an opportunity to move up a lot in the rankings with a victory over Kueter. However, Kueter has a clear size advantage over Mirasola, a consistent struggle for the undersized Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

Show up, text back like a functioning human and stop acting like effort is optional.</p>\n                <p>Modern dating isn\u2019t always cute; it can be exhausting. So stop with the games, stop with the mixed signals and for the love of all that is holy, stop chasing people who won\u2019t even meet you halfway.</p>\n                <p>A Review Board</p>\n                <p>Your friends are the jury. If your friends aren\u2019t hyping up your standards, they\u2019re enabling your delusions. We should be able to lean on our close friends for advice and some guidance. Navigating a love life isn\u2019t an easy task, and without a friendly jury, it\u2019s basically a trial by fire.</p>\n                <p>When it comes to crushes, dating and relationships, none of us have it all figured out. It\u2019s easy to get lost in your own feelings. Take a breath. Sometimes your friends can see the red flags or the hidden gems that you can\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>OUTS</p>\n                <p>Chasing the unavailable</p>\n                <p>Newsflash. If they\u2019re unavailable, they\u2019re unavailable. Stop wasting your emotional energy on a figment of your imagination. Chasing someone who isn\u2019t showing up for you isn\u2019t romantic. It\u2019s pathetic.</p>\n                <p>Your time, attention and feelings are worth more than being a background character in someone else\u2019s story. Walk away, save your energy and invest it where it\u2019s actually wanted.</p>\n                <p>Mixed signals</p>\n                <p>Mixed signals are manipulative. One minute, they\u2019re all warmth and charm, the next, they vanish like Houdini. If someone can\u2019t communicate, they\u2019re not complicated, they\u2019re careless.</p>\n                <p>Stop twisting yourself into knots trying to interpret vibes, texts or emojis like a cryptic code. Give your attention and effort to people who actually show up consistently, not ones who leave you guessing.</p>\n                <p>Ghosting</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not Halloween. Grow up.</p>\n                <p>Red flags</p>\n                <p>Listen, we will not be colorblind in 2026. If it\u2019s giving toxic energy, leave. Ignoring warning signs isn\u2019t brave; it's dumb. Likewise, red flags aren\u2019t suggestions; they\u2019re stop signs. Respect them and trust your gut.</p>\n                <p>I apologize if I sound a little harsh. Scratch that, I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019m here to be real with you.

    "title": "UPUA president\u2019s fall attendance raises concerns over bylaws, accountability",
    "author": "Mia Debelevich | News Editor",
    "description": "<p>The University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA) enforces mandatory attendance rules for general assembly members, but its governing documents do not establish attendance requirements for executive board members.</p>\n                <p>In order to pass any legislation, the UPUA needs general assembly members to meet its quorum of one-half plus one. For example, a 58-member general assembly would need 30 in attendance to pass legislation.</p>\n                <p>However, attendance requirements are not applicable to members of UPUA\u2019s executive board, which comprises the president, vice president, chief of staff and deputy chief of staff, as they are not considered members of the general assembly.</p>\n                <p>According to Article VI in the UPUA\u2019s bylaws, \u201cattendance of the General Assembly, Work Session, Committee of the Whole, and Committee Meetings is mandatory for all members of the Assembly.\u201d Any unexcused absences by general assembly members results in deficiency points.</p>\n                <p>Once representatives reach three deficiency points, their membership is reviewed, according to UPUA Vice President Noah Youcheff. He said if representatives attend tabling events, write extra legislation or engage in UPUA extracurricular work, they can bring their deficiency points down.</p>\n                <p>Hunter Steach, chief justice, said the expectation for executive attendance is an \u201cunsung rule,\u201d typically passed down from preceding presidents. He said some of the problems the UPUA had this past semester can be \u201cattributed to members of the executive branch not being there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Steach said he \u201chardly remembers\u201d any absences from the past three UPUA presidents. However, the same can not be said for Rasha Elwakil.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don't think it\u2019s the best reflection at all times, because we had a lot of attendance problems just across the board,\u201d Steach said. \u201cI've been in UPUA for four years and been going to GA \u2014 pretty much every GA \u2014 for the last four years, and from my perspective, I don't think we've ever struggled with attendance across the board as much as last semester.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Steach said he would be open to reviewing rules regarding attendance or introducing a formal mechanism that clearly outlines the expectations of executive members.</p>\n                <p>Elwakil arrived to the following meetings after the halfway point: Oct. 8, Oct. 29, Nov. 5 and Dec. 3.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI chose to be selfish and go to a (panhellenic) event because that was our last one of the year,\u201d Elwakil said at the Dec. 3 meeting. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s very hypocritical of me to not apologize when I\u2019ve been asking you guys to show up and be in attendance every week, and so I just did want to give that apology real quick and say I\u2019m truly sorry for that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Dec. 3 meeting was delayed due to an inability to meet quorum. Representatives were asked by Kat Hogan and Youcheff to contact other representatives and ask if they could attend the meeting.</p>\n                <p>Elwakil did not give her report at this meeting, stating she didn\u2019t want to take up more time of those in attendance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'm not perfect, and I won't say I was a perfect president,\u201d Elwakil said in an interview. \u201cBut I do say that I am trying my best and I think I am showing up for the organization.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Elwakil said only one UPUA member came to her with concerns about her absences following the Dec. 3 meeting. The conversation made her realize it was unnecessary to come late, she said.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI should have shown up, and I did reflect on that, and moving forward this semester, I'm making sure that I show up to everything, hopefully,\u201d Elwakil said.</p>\n                <p>Youcheff said attendance is a \u201cbig thing\u201d for UPUA, as it\u2019s important to meet quorum, hence the attendance requirements for representatives. He said the steering committee \u2014 which includes the president, vice president, chief of staff, chief justice and the five legislative committee chairs \u2014 has possible plans to intensify attendance requirements this semester.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been very amenable to the argument for implementing attendance points, and I think that conversation is going to be pretty big this year when we go into these governing document reviews and talk about that,\u201d Youcheff said.</p>\n                <p>Youcheff said people have varying opinions on the importance of attendance to the executive and judicial branches.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt kind of depends on what you view general assembly as,\u201d Youcheff said. \u201cIf you see it as this meeting where the whole student government gets together once a week and kind of gets their business done, a lot of people think everyone should be there for that. Other people think that the executive, judicial roles in general assembly aren\u2019t as crucial.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The vice president has to chair the assembly per 6.2.3 clause 2 of Article VI of the UPUA Constitution \u2014 so he described his attendance as necessary.</p>\n                <p>The clause states: \u201cThe Vice President shall preside over the meetings of the Assembly, retain floor privileges, and vote solely in the cases that will influence the outcome of a tied vote, except on votes to override a veto of the President.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite this, attendance is not tracked nor explicitly constitutionally required for the vice president of the organization. He said he\u2019s held accountable by representatives.</p>\n                <p>In the fall semester, Youcheff came to the beginning of the Oct. 29 meeting, but left due to a scheduled exam. It was the only meeting that occurred without his presence.</p>\n                <p>Youcheff, Steach and Elwakil all said they had no concerns about the attendance patterns of other executive members.</p>\n                <p>Hogan, speaker of the assembly, said attendance has been the topic of a \u201cmultitude\u201d of conversations within the UPUA\u2019s steering committee.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHaving leadership not be very active in attendance sets an example for the rest of the assembly,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt can be a bit difficult to try and encourage representatives to show up when they\u2019re seeing that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Hogan said she\u2019s spoken with at-large representatives who\u2019ve expressed discontent with the disparity in attendance policies. She said many feel \u201cdisheartened\u201d by the absence of their leaders.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI do think that there should be more attendance standards that the executive, and even judicial members, should be held accountable for,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat will be up for significant discussion when we get into our constitution and bylaw amendments later (this) semester.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Maria Lopez, justice and equity chair, said she\u2019s also noticed a change in the enthusiasm of the general assembly.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThough representatives look up usually to members of steering for guidance when it comes to initiatives or attendance or what projects to work on, I believe that this semester specifically some people have been a little unmotivated to continue on the work,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our ups and downs this semester, but I\u2019m grateful (representatives) have found that motivation to still come back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE INVESTIGATIONS</p>",

    "title": "\u2018That's going to cost you\u2019 | Penn State basketball loses rebounding, 2nd-chance point battles vs. UCLA",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After Mike Rhoades started his opening statement by thanking the fans who showed up like he usually does, he said what he felt was the reason behind UCLA\u2019s 71-60 win over Penn State on Wednesday night.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said it \u201ccame down\u201d to second-chance points with the Bruins outscoring the Nittany Lions 19 to 4 in that category. It was the main result of UCLA winning the rebound battle 32 to 21 as the Bruins secured a double-digit road win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought we've been rebounding the ball pretty well. We didn't do that today,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe give up too many second-chance points, and that's going to cost you. So I think some of it was fatigue, some of it was young guys out there, but you got to find a way to scrap out some defensive rebounds and give yourself a chance. We didn't do that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Before UCLA pulled away for the victory, Penn State had the Bruins in striking distance throughout the second half. With around 10:00 left in the game, UCLA missed three-straight 3-pointers, but it grabbed the offensive board every time before guard Trent Perry knocked down a jumper to give his squad a 52-49 lead.</p>\n                <p>A similar sequence happened a few minutes later as guard Donovan Dent missed a layup, but UCLA got the offensive rebound and got two more second-chance points via a pair of free throws by Perry. Those points gave the Bruins a 60-52 advantage as that was the closest the Nittany Lions were to the lead for the remaining 6:04 of the game.</p>\n                <p>Wing Eli Rice didn\u2019t know the exact statistics when he spoke with the media postgame, but he even knew that UCLA won the rebounding and second-chance point battles.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt definitely hurt us,\u201d Rice said. \u201cTheir second-chance points, I'm not sure what they are, but I'm sure it probably was way more than ours. So I mean, it definitely hurt us, and that's always a vocal point going into every game to box out and then with our offensive rebounds. But that's definitely what hurt us today, was the reason we lost again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Bruins finished the night with 11 offensive rebounds compared to Penn State\u2019s six. Furthermore, all four of the Nittany Lions\u2019 second-chance points came within the last four minutes of the game, when the Bruins consistently had a double-digit lead.</p>\n                <p>UCLA 6-foot-9 forward Tyler Bilodeau and 6-foot-10 center Steven Jamerson II totaled nine and eight rebounds, respectively. Both of them are taller than every Penn State player who saw minutes in Wednesday\u2019s game, except for freshman 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSome of it is size. Some of it is a young guy not pushing them out early enough,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe give up a bunch of offensive rebounds on the backside today because we didn't do our work early.

You keep doing it over again until they become good habits. You want it to be tomorrow morning, but the reality of it is 18 to 22-year-olds, nothing happens overnight. You just gotta keep working on it. Keep building habits. That's part of the culture you gotta build.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>UCLA\u2019s first-ever trip to State College was an eventful one.</p>\n                <p>In the midst of a three-game losing streak \u2013 all ranked opponents \u2013 Penn State has been desperate for a win.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions fought hard in their recent stretch of games and kept it interesting, but just weren\u2019t able to close it out, including a near-upset over then-ranked No. 2 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Once again, the blue and white just didn\u2019t have enough to keep up, and remain winless in conference play after falling to UCLA 71-60.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a tough game. I think it came down to second-chance points,\u201d Mike Rhoades said. \u201cWe gave up. We battled; we were in striking distance a few times. As the game went on, we settled\u2026 We gave up too many second-chance points, and that\u2019s gonna cost you.\u201d</p>\n                <p>To kick off just the third all-time meeting between the two programs, Penn State won the opening tipoff only to turn it over, giving the Bruins an optimal scoring opportunity.</p>\n                <p>However, a missed UCLA three-pointer turned into a defensive rebound, leading to an Ivan Juri\u0107 posterizing slam that put the Nittany Lions on the board first.</p>\n                <p>At the first media timeout, Penn State found itself with a 6-2 edge backed by Juri\u0107\u2019s four points and three forced Bruins turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Six points for Trent Perry in the early going gave the Bruins an 11-8 lead, but it didn\u2019t last long as Eli Rice drained two shots back-to-back, including a three-pointer, which tied the affair at 13-13.</p>\n                <p>The two cross-country foes traded points back-and-forth for a while and kept it tied up until momentum seemed to shift slightly to the blue and white\u2019s end of the court as a few Bruins turnovers and fouls allowed Penn State to take a 21-17 lead.</p>\n                <p>The low scoring continued for the last few minutes of the first half until UCLA started to put points on the board quickly, with just under two minutes left.</p>\n                <p>Just before the Bruins started up the scoring again, Freddie Dilione V went down with an ankle injury that Rhoades later said was a sprained ankle. Dilione V missed the remainder of the game, and that absence was felt all around.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFreddie went down; that obviously hurt us, but I think it was a group thing,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing good as a group.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Tyler Bilodeau and Eric Freeny each drained a three-pointer to put the Bruins in control at 29-21, but Melih Tunca, draining both of his free throws just before time expired, cut the blue and white lead to six points at the half.</p>\n                <p>Perry was the all-around points leader at the half with eight, shooting one-for-five from the field, but drilling six free throws on as many attempts.</p>\n                <p>Not only was the score close, but so was the rest of the game. Penn State was shooting 39% from the field while UCLA was shooting 35%.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions knocked down just one three-pointer in the first half and sent the Bruins to the charity stripe ten times, where they didn\u2019t miss once.</p>\n                <p>Tunca hit one from downtown to start the second half for his first points of the night aside from free throws.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was closing in, cutting the deficit to 31-30 until a UCLA three-pointer stopped the effort. The Nittany Lions matched it with a Rice three, but it wasn\u2019t enough to gain an edge.</p>\n                <p>On fire to start the second half, Perry sank another three-pointer to once again grab a four-point lead and give himself 14 points on the night, still the most from either end to that point.</p>\n                <p>UCLA grabbed an eight-point lead, its largest of the night, after a Bilodeau and-one. It didn\u2019t take long for Penn State to close in, though, as points came in rapid succession.</p>\n                <p>Dominick Stewart\u2019s physicality and long-range shooting gave the Nittany Lions their first lead since the late stages of the first half, but an immediate Bilodeau three-pointer put the Bruins back up with a slight 50-49 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions found themselves in the midst of an 11-1 UCLA run, however, and went down 58-50 not long after they captured that hard-fought lead.</p>\n                <p>Perry and Bilodeau had 24 and 21 points each, with five minutes left to play as the Bruins jumped up to a 63-52 lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSometimes you get lost in the game,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201c(UCLA) made their threes, and we didn\u2019t. That was a huge difference.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Eric Dailey Jr. was the only other UCLA starter with any points.</p>\n                <p>Penn State struck back, but being down 13 points with three minutes to play is not a recipe for success.</p>\n                <p>The deficit proved insurmountable, and the Nittany Lions suffered their fourth-straight loss, falling 71-60.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s super frustrating,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI mean, close doesn\u2019t get you the win; it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s still a zero in the column. It\u2019s definitely frustrating, but we want to win, we don\u2019t want to be close.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Now at 9-8 on the year, Penn State finds itself just one game ahead of Northwestern and two games ahead of Maryland in the Big Ten Standings.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s standout freshman Kayden Mingo was out again with a broken nose sustained in practice before the Michigan game. He underwent successful surgery but will be \u201cout for a while.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Tibor Mirti\u010d also missed action with a knee injury. Mirti\u010d will \u201cbe out for a little bit\u201d as his knee is \u201cjust rehabbing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions look to snap their now four-game losing streak when they hit the road and head south to Maryland to take on the Terrapins on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Scheduled tipoff is set for noon.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

He\u2019ll finish the season with a 5-2 record, with both of his losses coming on medical forfeits.</p>\n                <p>He will likely need surgery, as Sanderson mentioned postgame after the win over Rutgers. In place of Nagao, Braeden Davis will likely be the starter at 141 the rest of the way.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe reality of what Aaron was coming back from, just an uphill battle,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cShoulders are really challenging in our sport. It's complicated, obviously, joint positions you get put in wrestling, but if anyone could do it, it was Aaron. So, we want to give him the best support and opportunity we could give him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Iowa</p>\n                <p>Just like Penn State, Iowa has historically been in the top tier of collegiate wrestling programs.</p>\n                <p>Come Friday night, in a battle between the No. 1 Nittany Lions and the No. 4 Hawkeyes, Sanderson knows his team will have to bring it, but still keep the main thing the main thing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSame mentality,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cOf course, Iowa is a great opponent. Great wrestlers, great coaches, great tradition and history. We got to be ready to roll.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Carver Hawkeye Area notoriously is known for being a raucous environment and drawing great crowds. There\u2019s no doubt the Hawkeye faithful will bring the juice on Friday night.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said Penn State will be ready for it, as the squad has wrestled in a handful of similar atmospheres, paired with having them in their own backyard.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we're blessed. I mean, most of the places we go, we get a great crowd,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe wrestle in front of a great crowd here at Penn State, whether it's in Rec Hall or the (Bryce) Jordan Center. So we're used to getting to compete in front of enthusiastic fans. That makes what we do more fun and worthwhile.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Iowa has a handful of talented wrestlers, notably No. 1 Angelo Ferrari at 184 pounds, No. 3 Michael Caliendo at 165 and No. 5 Ben Kueter at 285. At 197 pounds, Penn State could see Gabe Arnold or Harvey Ludington, as previous starter Massoma Endene is no longer with the team.</p>\n                <p>Regardless of who is wrestling or how good the opponent may be, Penn State has heavy hitters of their own.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur guys are just gonna do what they do,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cIt doesn't make a lot of sense to make any adjustments. Obviously, you're aware of your opponents, but at the same time, the long-term plan is let's get better at what we do, and keep improving and go compete to the best of our ability with some fire and enthusiasm.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Masanosuke Ono</p>\n                <p>It was big news for Penn State when it landed Japanese world champion Masanosuke Ono to its roster during the offseason.</p>\n                <p>During his preseason media availability, Sanderson said the plan for Ono would be for him to redshirt. Now, there\u2019s questions as to if he\u2019ll actually compete this year due to his health.</p>\n                <p>Ono sustained a kidney illness, according to a report from Wrestling Spirits. The news came out in light of him supposed to wrestle in Japan\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Cup in December, but he ended up withdrawing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve been discussing that. But, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see him this year or not. He\u2019s got to get back and get healthy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Cael\u2019s Cookie</p>\n                <p>Off the mat and into the kitchen, Sanderson was asked about his new business venture that has to do with cookies to wrap up the media session.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson, a self-proclaimed enjoyer of cookies, tried to start his own line close to 20 years ago but didn\u2019t find much triumph.</p>\n                <p>Now, he recently got back into the field as an enjoyable side quest and is finding more success, releasing \u201cCael\u2019s Cookie.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI have a very small part in it, but it was something that\u2019s kind of fun and I really like them,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cBasically just got a group of killers to kind of take it and run with it and that's what they're doing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Sam Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Who doesn\u2019t like scoring?</p>\n                <p>It was a high-scoring affair and a historic night for Ohio State as Penn State battled with the No. 14 Buckeyes in the Jerome Schottenstein Center.</p>\n                <p>Despite the stats, Penn State\u2019s 0-6 Big Ten record and 7-10 overall losing record did not faze the scarlet and white, who put forth a Big Ten season-high of 108 points scored in a single game.</p>\n                <p>Last year, the meeting between Penn State and Ohio State served as a \u2018trap game\u2019 for the Buckeyes. This season, it marked nothing more than a regular Big Ten clash.</p>\n                <p>However, the Lady Lions finally played at their opponent's level, not backing down despite early struggles. Less surprisingly, more of the same struggles plagued Penn State in a 108-84 loss.</p>\n                <p>Hunched over as she observed from the bench, coach Carolyn Kieger could only watch as a disparagingly large Buckeye lead mounted early on. In the blink of an eye, Ohio State found itself holding a double-digit lead.</p>\n                <p>As the game approached, Penn State had remained searching for its spark. On Wednesday night, the rookie, Nyla McFadden, earned the start as Tea Cleante moved to the bench. However, as the season has already proved, the lineups haven\u2019t mattered.</p>\n                <p>The turnovers, slow starts, and long runs have.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions allowed a massive run out of the gate as Ohio State took advantage of another slow start. Penn State endured a drought that lasted over halfway through the first quarter with no points.</p>\n                <p>It was the guard-big duo of Jaloni Cambridge and Elsa Lemmila that dominated as Penn State surrendered the mass of its points inside. Following a major deficit, the Lady Lions began to wake up and combated the run with disciplined basketball.</p>\n                <p>Moriah Murray, who hadn\u2019t scored in double-digits since her outing against VCU, was the main culprit. While Kiyomi McMiller established an offensive rhythm, it was others who added the flare Kieger had sought.</p>\n                <p>Instead of digging a bigger hole, Penn State settled in as the adjustments began to take place. Penn State took a trip down memory lane to revisit its win last season. Despite the mostly new roster, there were two constants who had seen what it took.</p>\n                <p>Along with Murray, Gracie Merkle became the focal point of the offense. Beyond the arc, Murray had fired back with several triples, while Merkle took advantage of the height advantage inside. The pairing successfully brought Penn State back within striking range after scoring 13 and 12 points at the break.</p>\n                <p>As the old saying goes, \u2018Defense wins championships.\u2019 If Penn State were to pull off another upset over Ohio State, it would need an elite defensive effort to complement the offense. Both Cambridge and Lemmila proved to be an issue on that end as they had combined for 34 points at the break.</p>\n                <p>Being down by less than ten points at the half has become an unfamiliar sight for the Lady Lions. Ultimately, the blueprint had been laid out before their eyes. Penn State had to get stops.</p>\n                <p>After switching out of a full-court press, Penn State favored a 3-2 zone, aimed to force the ball out of Cambridge and Lemmila\u2019s hands. Yet, what followed wasn\u2019t the result Penn State had hoped for.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State followed Kieger\u2019s lead in utilizing a zone to contain the Merkle inside. The Buckeyes got their way as Merkle\u2019s quiet third frame gave way to a near 20-point lead. But Penn State was scratching and clawing.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions were able to generate points off turnovers, turning defense into offense. Just as McMiller neared 20 points, Penn State found itself down by ten points. Ohio State began to expose Penn State\u2019s defense as the three-point shooting inserted the dagger.</p>\n                <p>Chance Gray hit seven threes on the night, many of which came in the second half. In addition, Ohio State made 17 triples; the red-hot offense had stalled all the momentum the Lady Lions were building up, and closed the door for good.</p>\n                <p>Cambridge, Gray, and Lemmila led the team, all scoring above 20 points each, and combining for 77 points. There was no overcoming that margin for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s Amiya Evans did not suit up in her second-straight contest.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will host Rutgers on Sunday, Jan. 18, for the school\u2019s White Out game, sponsored by THON. The Scarlet Knights, with a 0-6 Big Ten record, will present Penn State\u2019s best opportunity to earn its first conference victory.

    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s volleyball is off to a dominant start, defeating Mount Olive in its home opener 3-1.</p>\n                <p>In the match, Sean Harvey led the Nittany Lions, collecting 13 kills on 29 total attempts, and Miller Trubey, who racked up 10 kills on 25 total attempts, was just behind him as the secondary option. Jaxon Herr and Michael Schwob combined for a total of 44 assists en route to a blue and white victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State followed up that strong performance with a 3-0 shutout win against Manhattan on Saturday. Harvey led the Nittany Lions with 14 kills on 18 attempts, hitting a resounding 0.667.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has the opportunity to build on its hot start with matches against St. Thomas Aquinas at 7 p.m. Thursday and Lewis at 7 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>St. Thomas Aquinas</p>\n                <p>The Spartans are off to a rough start, losing their first two matchups with Pepperdine and USC and getting swept in the process.</p>\n                <p>However, St. Thomas Aquinas suffered the same fate at the start of last year\u2019s season before finishing 16-9 behind a seven-match and five-match win streak.</p>\n                <p>Through their first two games, outside hitter Kyran Versteegen leads the Spartans, accounting for 16 kills this season, more than doubling the total of his next closest teammate.</p>\n                <p>The junior will need to have his best performance of the season in order to give the Spartans a shot at stealing a victory in Happy Valley, especially if Harvey continues to swing effectively for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>This matchup marks the first all-time between Penn State and St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>\n                <p>Lewis</p>\n                <p>Unlike the Spartans, Lewis heads into this matchup with momentum after winning each of its first two matches against Menlo College and No. 9 Stanford, both with sweeps.</p>\n                <p>Oguzhan Oguz leads the Flyers in kills with 26 and leads their frontline. However, Lewis has a balanced attack, with three players already collecting 20 or more kills this season. Winning the battle at the net will be key in their matchup with the Nittany Lions, as Harvey, Trubey and Matthew Luoma have an attempt to keep Penn State rolling.</p>\n                <p>Lewis arrives off a strong season, earning a 22-9 record, including a sweep victory over the blue and white in the teams\u2019 only meeting of the season.</p>\n                <p>This season, Penn State has the advantage of home court, which is crucial for securing a victory, as Lewis finished 7-6 away from home last year, compared to its 14-3 home record.</p>\n                <p>Both teams are off to strong starts, and this will be an early test for both squads as the season begins to ramp up.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

I'm not sure what they all are, but there are things we need to address and address them quickly over the next coming weeks.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council member Nalini Krishnankutty said much of the fear and anxiety from State College residents stemmed from concerns that local law enforcement organizations may not be equipped to ensure peoples\u2019 safety while handling the different operating procedures of external organizations.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere were people who were not feeling safe anymore in the sense that it doesn't matter what our local policing is committed to, we might have other law enforcement agencies that might not be practicing the same things,\u201d Krishnankutty said. \u201cIf they do something that doesn't seem right, we are not sure there's going to be an independent investigation. It's just very different from, or appears to be different from, what we are committed to and we don't seem to have the resources to assure us that we are safe if other law enforcement comes into our community.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn council, we've already decried the killings of people like Melissa Hortman and Charlie Kirk, but this feels different on a different level, because our own government did it,\u201d Council Member Matt Herndon added.\u201c...I've seen people say it's not unusual for politicians to take factual liberties and while this may be true for many, it does not have to be and we should not accept it. Facts matter, the truth matters, we must demand the truth.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council member Gopal Balachandran said it was \u201cchilling\u201d to see the reaction of ICE agents immediately after Good\u2019s death and how it was another example of law enforcement agencies failing to prevent acts of violence upon those they are meant to protect.</p>\n                <p>He said both Democrats and Republicans are responsible for empowering ICE in their own ways and believed it was up to bipartisan action to curb the actions of the federal government, both at home and abroad.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe problems with our immigration laws stretch long and far; our problems with our foreign policy stretch far and wide, and they are bipartisan issues, meaning that Democrats and Republicans bear responsibility for it,\u201d Balachandran said. \u201cWhile I am horrified by what has happened and I do believe that we need to do whatever we can to fight what appears to be very serious threats to our democracy, the rule of law, and the respect for human rights and dignity, we should not kid ourselves that this somehow began with the Trump administration in 2024 when it's been an ongoing feature of American political life and American foreign policy for a very, very long time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BOROUGH COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s hockey used a rejuvenated lineup to dominate Minnesota in a sweep last weekend. While it played its best games of the season, it didn\u2019t escape unscathed. A few key injuries sustained in the Big Ten series will be key moving forward for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Defense</p>\n                <p>Throughout the first half of the season, Penn State\u2019s defense struggled to find an identity, which was an issue Guy Gadowsky preached on in nearly every press conference until winter break.</p>\n                <p>Upon return, and the return of Cade Christenson, Penn State\u2019s defense has begun showing some consistency and an identity that can lead the Nittany Lions forward.</p>\n                <p>Every series showed a shuffling of lines prior to these past two weeks. Now, the pairings of Jackson Smith-Jarod Crespo and Mac Gadowsky-Christenson have performed well enough to remain together long term.</p>\n                <p>The defense allowed both Kevin Reidler and Josh Fleming to benefit, giving up just two goals behind a scrappy bunch that broke up passes, exited the defensive zone cleanly and contributed to the scoreboard as well.</p>\n                <p>Penalties</p>\n                <p>One of the blue and white\u2019s defining traits in the 2025 half of the season was its tendency to engage in heated matchups that stuck them in the penalty box for extended periods of games. Heading into the break, Penn State was the most penalized team in the country.</p>\n                <p>Against Minnesota, Penn State took victories without lighting up the penalty board. The Nittany Lions had just three penalties in the first game, in which they shut out the Golden Gophers, and kept the number low in Game 2.</p>\n                <p>This was seemingly the product of cleaner defensive play that was able to control the pace without crossing the line.</p>\n                <p>Outside of just penalty kill, this showed deeper progress for the Nittany Lions\u2019 mindset. They weren\u2019t just avoiding penalties, they were keeping their heads level, even in a second game where Minnesota pushed their boundaries.</p>\n                <p>The only moment all weekend where Penn Star overstated their emotions was after Braedon Ford was injured on a hit into the boards.</p>\n                <p>Injuries</p>\n                <p>While Penn State regained Aiden Fink and Christenson over break, the hockey gods wouldn\u2019t let them off the hook. The team suffered a few injuries during the series with Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>The big one came in the first period Saturday when Charlie Cerrato left the game, not returning to action last weekend. Gadowsky stated that Cerrato was day-to-day heading towards Penn State\u2019s series against Notre Dame.</p>\n                <p>Casey Aman and Shea Van Olm are also role-players who are day-to-day heading into this weekend. Aman served as the extra skater against Minnesota on Saturday, while Van Olm fills a bottom-six role.</p>\n                <p>Van Olm and Cerrato will be even more important heading into this weekend with the news that Braedon Ford will be out of action long term with a lower-body injury. Ford took a shot to his ankle while being hit into the boards and spent a prolonged time on the ice before being helped off. Prior to the injury, he scored his first goal of the year off a feed from Gavin McKenna.</p>\n                <p>These injuries will test Penn State\u2019s forward depth that has been an issue for them throughout the season. However, during the last games, the depth started showing up for Penn State. Luke Misa and Lev Katzin each showed up on the score sheet against Minnesota. Contributions like those will need to be the answer to how Penn State weathers the injury bug.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

With another top-25 Big Ten opponent on the schedule this week, answers need to be found soon.</p>\n                <p>During the weekly media session, Kieger spoke about those changes, as well as the future outlook of the team.</p>\n                <p>Scouting the Buckeyes</p>\n                <p>Despite upsetting Ohio State in last year\u2019s matchup, chances are very low for a repeat on Wednesday, with ESPN Analytics giving Penn State just a 3.7% chance of winning.</p>\n                <p>The Buckeyes are home to several of the best players in the Big Ten, including Jaloni Cambridge. Cambridge is averaging 21.2 points per game through 17 games and has a pair of 30-plus point performances.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe got to build a wall around Jaloni,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cShe\u2019s probably the number one player in the country right now in transition offense. She\u2019s super talented at running, so we need to change up defenses a bit to give pressure.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In addition to the offensive challenges presented by Ohio State, the Buckeyes also have one of the top defenses in the country, forcing 13.4 steals per game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously, we need to take care of the ball,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cSo we got to weather the press. We know they're going to get up and in full court on every play.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Defensive changes</p>\n                <p>After giving up 94 points to Illinois and 105 points to Michigan, Sunday\u2019s postgame press conference was centered around defense.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions allowed the Fighting Illini to shoot nearly 60% from the field and 50% from 3-point range as they fell by 16 points.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think a lot of it comes down to one-on-one defense,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe call it guarding your yard, three feet in both directions.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Freshman Nyla McFadden stood out as a strong defensive presence against Illinois, guarding every position on the floor. However, the rest of the team\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t satisfy Kieger\u2019s expectations.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe willingness to step up and guard your area, guard your yard, (is missing),\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI can\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s one thing, but if I had to bottle it up all into one word, it would be toughness.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Retention</p>\n                <p>Amidst a six-game losing streak with five more top-25 matchups on the horizon, Penn State has fallen out of March Madness contention and are teetering on the verge of missing the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions have a young squad with only two seniors and all of its starters set to return next year.</p>\n                <p>However, in the ever-changing world of college sports, retention has become a hot-topic issue, and Kieger is well aware of that with the offseason quickly approaching.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s obviously on the forefront of everyone's minds right now in college athletics,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cPlayers are motivated by different things, so relationships and player retention are big things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After losing 11 players to the transfer portal in the last two years, Kieger has to focus on bringing back Moriah Murray, Kiyomi McMiller and Gracie Merkle next season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBuilding continuity and keeping players and making transformational changes and building energy (are important),\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI think you see the teams that are having the most success right now have been together for a couple years to build that synergy amongst their star players.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Several State College residents spoke before the borough council during a meeting Monday to express concerns over the redevelopment of Arnold Addison Court, known informally as Addison Court.</p>\n                <p>The building, which opened in 1994 to provide affordable housing to elderly and handicapped State College Borough residents within the downtown area, has already seen preliminary plans for its redevelopment into a mixed-use structure viewed by the State College Design Review Board during a meeting last Tuesday.</p>\n                <p>Kathryn Santoro, a tenant of Addison Court, said she was having trouble finding housing outside of the complex due to unaffordability, as well as most not being handicapped-accessible.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI came to Addison Court because it's 55 and over and I wanted to be close to the community,\u201d Santoro said. \u201cYou're going to put a condo in Addison Court. It's gonna contain four or five bedrooms. How come you guys, borough and the planning commission, say, \u2018Wait a minute: is it all about money?\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>Santoro said she was concerned the new development would only prioritize Penn State students and believed its construction would push out older residents living in that area.</p>\n                <p>Richard McCarty, another tenant of Addison Court, said it\u2019s a newer building, and those residing within it have disabilities that would be impacted by the redevelopment.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of (residents) possess particular disabilities, etc., from which they don't even go outside their doors and stuff,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cThere are over 60 individuals out of the 80 plus units in Addison Court, which is not an old building. There are old buildings in State College that probably should be torn down. Addison Court, I do not believe, is one of those.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council President Evan Myers said it was the borough\u2019s responsibility to its residents to find ways to ensure that the tenants of Addison Court are able to find housing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe community is crying for help,\u201d Myers said. \u201cEven though we have no ownership in Addison Court, and we never did, we did help facilitate its construction and use it and behooves us to do all we can to help to provide some similar living situation, and we should do what we can to make that happen.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council member Kevin Kassab said he felt it was the borough\u2019s responsibility to ensure the tenants of Addison Court were able to find housing in a market that does not have many options for them.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe had an investment, or whatever we'd had, when Addison Court was built, putting these individuals into a home that they thought was gonna be their home until they passed and now they're going to be displaced so I do feel kind of like it's sort of something,\u201d Kassab said. \u201cSomehow, we have to figure out and it's gonna be tough because we all know affordable housing in the borough practically doesn't exist.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Josh Portney, another council member said Addison Court has several connections to the organization through its work to establish the complex.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have 60 individuals that, in a couple years, may lose their house,\u201d Portney said. \u201cThe borough council in 1990 shepherded this building from beginning to end. We knew about it. There was a zoning change, there was an amendment done, there was even financial support for parts of the building from the borough council. It is private development, but we have our thumbs a little bit on it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Portney said he found it \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to have to see residents be put at risk of losing housing and demanded that the council work to ensure that their needs are met.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have to literally look at every option and I've said this before, and I know it's really uncomfortable for us, but we've done eminent domain before,\u201d Portney said. \u201cI know that this is very controversial and this might be the most extreme thing that I'm proposing, and I proposed a lot of extreme things in my tenure, but we have to look at every option and if it's not that, it's promising them a place at Bellaire Court. If it's not that, it's promising them a place at another housing that's on a bus line that's located in our downtown. This is our work.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BOROUGH COVERAGE</p>",

He said he found that, while litigating the Subramanyam \u201cSubu\u201d Vedam case, internal oversight measures within law enforcement aren\u2019t always successful in preventing misconduct.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat a lot of people don't know is that there was a process in place for the D.A.'s office to be able to review old convictions which was called a conviction integrity unit and in many ways, it was meant to be kind of like an oversight process within the DA's office, sort of like an internal affairs unit or maybe even like the community oversight board,\u201d Balachandran said. \u201cWhen the Centre County District Attorney looked at the same information that I looked at, they decided there was no problem with Subu Vedam's conviction. It was completely correct. All the policing was great. There was no improper misconduct at all. Well, lo and behold, when we actually litigate the case, we find that there is a whole lot of misconduct that occurred.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Nalini Krishnankutty, another council member, said she wanted to see an increased emphasis on anti-bias, policing and immigration within the training of new COB members along with an overview of policies detailing the training and applications for use of force.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey are going to overview everything and the reason I want to elevate these two is because all members should really know that,\u201d Krishnankutty said. \u201cI'd really like to have those come up.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After further discussion among the council, the issue was tabled for later discussion on Feb. 2, when the council is expected to make a final decision.</p>\n                <p>MORE BOROUGH COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Weekly recap | Penn State women\u2019s basketball goes 0-2, continues losing stretch",
    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Playing with homecourt advantage over two top teams from the Big Ten, Penn State looked for its first win since early December in last week\u2019s outings.</p>\n                <p>Instead, the Lady Lions endured a blowout loss to Michigan and suffered a close loss to Illinois, extending their losing streak to six games.</p>\n                <p>Despite falling to 7-10 on the year, there were several takeaways \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 from last week\u2019s 0-2 stretch.</p>\n                <p>Rise of McFadden</p>\n                <p>Despite playing in 16 games this season, 30% of freshman Nyla McFadden\u2019s minutes this season came from last week.</p>\n                <p>The Fort Lauderdale, Florida, native was praised for coach Carolyn Kieger postgame, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s been doing everything we\u2019ve asked, working her butt off and staying true to the process. I really can\u2019t say enough about her.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In just 12 minutes against the Wolverines, McFadden scored 10 points, including going 2-for-2 from deep.</p>\n                <p>In the following game, she played a career-high 27 minutes and posted another double-digit performance. McFadden scored 12 points with two rebounds and two assists as she earned her first career start.</p>\n                <p>Standing at just 6-foot, McFadden\u2019s quickness and toughness allowed her to guard nearly every position on the floor on Sunday, making herself a valuable asset for the remainder of the season.</p>\n                <p>Defense</p>\n                <p>Six \u2014 that\u2019s how many times coach Kieger said the word defense in her two minutes and fifteen seconds of postgame media on Sunday. Those weren\u2019t positive references either.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions gave up 105 points to Michigan on Thursday and 92 to Illinois, two of the highest scoring totals of the season.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offense put up 76 points on Sunday, which would\u2019ve been enough to win half the games so far this season. Instead, the defense allowed the Fighting Illini to shoot nearly 60% from the court with 50% from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>Different aspects of the blue and white\u2019s defense showed up, as it forced 21 turnovers on Illinois. However, they only recorded nine turnovers against the Wolverines.</p>\n                <p>Rebounding was a similar struggle during Sunday\u2019s game, as the Lady Lions allowed 10 offensive rebounds while recording just 13 defensive rebounds.</p>\n                <p>As Kieger said, \u201cUntil we develop this toughness and this grit to play defense, the results aren\u2019t going to change.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gracie Merkle\u2019s efficiency</p>\n                <p>6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle stands as one of the most efficient players in the country through 10 weeks, shooting 74.6% from the field.</p>\n                <p>Against both Big Ten squads last week, Merkle went a combined 17-for-23 as she tallied 42 points.</p>\n                <p>However, Merkle\u2019s biggest highlight from the game on Sunday was her free throw efficiency. With her strong, back-to-the-basket style of play, the Mount Washington, Kentucky, native has found her way to the free throw line for 59 shots this season.</p>\n                <p>Against Illinois, Merkle shot from the free throw line 10 times, going 8-for-10. Earlier in the year, she shot under 60% from the line, but has since gone over 60%.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dozens of protesters gathered at the Old Main steps Monday evening to honor Renee Good and protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) increased presence throughout the country.</p>\n                <p>The event was organized by the Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity (SCDS) and People's Defense Front, in response to the death of 37-year-old, Minnesota resident Good, who was shot in her car by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.</p>\n                <p>Tyler Evock said protests like this are important to show that there are people all over the country who believe what ICE is doing to be an \u201cinjustice.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing from ICE, and all of law enforcement, is that they are too violent,\u201d Evock, a Penn State graduate, said.</p>\n                <p>Evock also expressed concern that ICE is making it even more difficult to go through the proper nationalization processes.</p>\n                <p>As the protest continued, speakers from SCDS, the People\u2019s Defense Front and Latino Caucus spoke into a megaphone to lead chants, give speeches and speak out against ICE.</p>\n                <p>Chants of \u201cSay her name\u201d were answered again and again by the crowd with: \u201cRenee Good.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As chants continued, other attendees, like Lydia and David Vandenbergh, held lit candles in remembrance of Good.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it sends a signal, hopefully, especially to our congressional representatives, that they have to start standing up for this,\u201d David, a State College resident, said.</p>\n                <p>Lydia, another resident, said she didn\u2019t believe ICE was acting as they should and doesn\u2019t think \u201cjustice is being served.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After the speeches at Old Main, the group moved through downtown State College.

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State basketball started 0-3 in 2026, however the games were against three AP-ranked opponents, which boosts optimism as they move forward.</p>\n                <p>Here are three major takeaways from the most recent stretch of games where the blue and white faced then-No.20 Illinois, No. 2 Michigan and No. 5 Purdue.</p>\n                <p>Close, but no cigar</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions finished ten points in each of those games and even had a final possession against the Wolverines, with Freddie Dilione V just barely missing a shot on a questionable play call that Michigan easily snuffed out.</p>\n                <p>That sentiment echoes the trend of how the Nittany Lions play down the stretch, as experienced, higher-performing teams quickly derail any attempt by the blue and white to pull off an upset.</p>\n                <p>Against Illinois, the blue and white fell behind by 14 at the half and traded buckets with the Fighting Illini, but couldn\u2019t overcome the efficiency of its foe. Against Michigan, despite the Wolverines opening a path to victory by shooting over 10 percentage points worse after the break, the Nittany Lions still shot under 40% and struggled from beyond the arc and at the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Purdue contest marking an improved second-half shooting stretch, the blue and white dished out half as many assists and turned the ball over five times, while the Boilermakers turned it over once, again putting the win out of reach down the wire.</p>\n                <p>Tale of two shooters</p>\n                <p>In the early games of 2026, the Nittany Lions sought to improve their shooting from beyond the arc; a team that averaged 7.8 threes per game surpassed that mark in this stretch of contests. That shooting came courtesy of two main wings, Eli Rice and Dominick Stewart, who ramped up their willingness to empty the clip from downtown.</p>\n                <p>Rice posted a season high in shot attempts over the stretch, while Stewart also surpassed his averages for field goals and three-point attempts per game in two of the contests. Both the 3-and-D players posted mixed results despite their newfound willingness to shoot.</p>\n                <p>Stewart, over the three games, shot 2-for-18 from the field and committed 12 fouls, while Rice went 10-for-23 with six long-range makes.</p>\n                <p>Via Evan Miyakawa\u2019s statistical formulas, Stewart ranks as the least efficient and worst-performing Nittany Lion with over 200 possessions. On the contrary, Rice ranks fourth on the squad in performance and posts the best defensive rating.</p>\n                <p>Introduction to injury</p>\n                <p>In two of the three games Penn State played, it did so without star freshman guard Kayden Mingo, who reportedly suffered a broken nose in practice. That absence raised concerns among the blue-and-white fanbase, as most of the Nittany Lions' on-court identity is from Mingo.</p>\n                <p>The Farmingdale, New York, native provides all-around skills: playmaking, scoring, defense and leadership, yet the difficulty without him didn\u2019t seem to be much greater than with his services, as Penn State still posted formidable results.</p>\n                <p>It does mark the first major injury for Penn State this season, and he\u2019s joined on the sidelines by Tibor Mirti\u0107, who appeared on the availability report before the Purdue game after exiting against Michigan.</p>\n                <p>The last injury report for Penn State men\u2019s basketball marked the lengthiest it\u2019s been so far this season.</p>\n                <p>Both the guard and forward likely miss extended time for Penn State, and navigating a less-than-full-strength roster is essential for Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad, as it looks to build a foundation and confidence on the court outside of its budding superstar.</p>\n                <p>Over the past week of play, Penn State seems to have started strongly toward that goal, which should result in a stronger team once everyone is available.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>While Penn State fell to Illinois to continue its six-game losing streak, the Big Ten saw several other storylines in the past week of conference play.</p>\n                <p>From top-25 showdowns to busted win streaks and continued losing streaks, many teams had their fair share of highlights and big games.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a recap of the conference action this week.</p>\n                <p>USC falls to Oregon, Minnesota</p>\n                <p>USC has looked like a different team this year without JuJu Watkins, and that was on display even more this past week.</p>\n                <p>Entering the week as No. 21 in the AP poll, the Trojans fell to two unranked teams in Oregon and Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>USC pulled into a commanding 23-9 lead after the first quarter against the Ducks, and that was extended even more to a 16-point lead at half. However, Oregon flipped the script in the final quarter, outscoring USC 26-8 to win the game.</p>\n                <p>Against the Golden Gophers, Jazzy Davidson \u2014 the No. 1 athlete in the Class of 2025 \u2014 scored 21 points alongside senior Kara Dunn\u2019s 27 points.</p>\n                <p>The team\u2019s bench was the ultimate letdown, however, scoring just three points.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota\u2019s Grace Grocholski and Sophie Hart combined for 40 to win 63-62, sending USC to the middle of the Big Ten with a 2-3 conference record.</p>\n                <p>Purdue beats Wisconsin, Washington</p>\n                <p>Following three straight losses, Purdue found some hope to rejuvenate its season with a pair of upset wins over Wisconsin and Washington.</p>\n                <p>The Boilermakers had a disappointing start to the season, losing to their satellite campus Purdue Fort Worth and to Central Michigan. However, they showed signs of strength in their two wins that could carry deeper into the season.</p>\n                <p>Purdue pulled out to a commanding 18-9 lead after the first quarter to Wisconsin, and despite the Badgers closing the gap to one point at halftime, closed out the game while outscoring Wisconsin by seven points in the second half.</p>\n                <p>A big part of Purdue\u2019s success came from the triple, as it went 12-for-20 from deep. Sophomore Nya Smith led the way with four 3-pointers, followed by Madison Layden-Zay\u2019s three triples.</p>\n                <p>The first quarter played out a little differently against Washington, however, as Purdue entered the second quarter down by nine points.</p>\n                <p>While junior Sayvia Sellers scored 23 points against the Boilermakers, they were able to bring the game to overtime tied at 63 each.</p>\n                <p>Layden-Zay and Tara Daye put the nail in the coffin in overtime, each scoring 19 points on the game to win by six \u2014 tying USC with 10 wins on the year.</p>\n                <p>No. 19 Ohio State earns upset over No. 8 Maryland</p>\n                <p>After falling to No. 1 UConn and No. 4 UCLA earlier in the year, Ohio State earned its first big win of the year as it handed Maryland its second loss of the year.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins came out of the first quarter shooting 60% from deep with a 24-12 lead over Ohio State. However, the Buckeyes scored 28 points in the second and fourth quarters to win by 13 points.</p>\n                <p>Jaloni Cambridge continued to craft her second straight All Big Ten season, scoring 28 points on Maryland.</p>\n                <p>Kylee Kitts, Kennedy Cambridge and Chance Grey all scored double digits as well, combining for 43 points.</p>\n                <p>Despite the loss, Maryland\u2019s Oluchi Okananwa scored 27 points, recording over 20 points for the fifth time this year.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State started its 2026 half of the season with three consecutive ranked opponents, and was unable to claim any victories despite hard-fought battles.</p>\n                <p>Eight points decided the games against then-No. 20 Illinois and No. 5 Purdue, while the No. 2 Michigan contest came all the way down to the wire with a missed Freddie Dilione V jumper on the final buzzer, giving the Wolverines a 74-72 win. After five conference games, the blue and white sit winless.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will break the streak of facing top-of-the-conference and national opponents when it faces UCLA on Wednesday at the Bryce Jordan Center, where the Nittany Lions hold a 7-3 home record.</p>\n                <p>Although both teams play in the same conference, there are no common opponents between Penn State and UCLA so far this season. UCLA\u2019s last two games against Wisconsin and Maryland will be Penn State's next two opponents after this game.</p>\n                <p>On the surface, scouting the Bruins, they remain a daunting foe at 11-5 overall, with a 3-2 conference record and an undefeated home streak after 10 games.</p>\n                <p>Bogged down Bruins</p>\n                <p>As the initial scouting report for UCLA presents, it doesn\u2019t possess many flaws, with a top-half conference offense and defense. The Bruins\u2019 +9.8 point scoring differential is a top-10 figure in the conference, despite their scoring average being the sixth lowest in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>These figures indicate a slower tempo and an efficient offensive approach from the Bruins, who rank sixth in the conference in field goal percentage. UCLA averages 70 possessions per game, placing it outside the top 240 teams nationally.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions, who hold a slightly worse scoring offense but a much less effective defense, rank only somewhat behind the Bruins in possessions per game.</p>\n                <p>Luckily for the blue and white UCLA typically averages fewer offensive touches with the ball when they\u2019re away from home, and is heading to Happy Valley, where Penn State ranks similarly to UCLA in their top level of play at home.</p>\n                <p>Evan Miyakawa\u2019s formulas state that UCLA is a consistent team that plays the same regardless of the level of competition and pace. That tempo is again where a differential may emerge; however, the Bruins hold a bottom-six Big Ten tempo rating, while Penn State ranks in the top six.</p>\n                <p>The two coaching styles clash at the BJC, yet only one can prevail.</p>\n                <p>Participating personnel</p>\n                <p>Both Mike Rhoades and UCLA coach Mick Cronin\u2019s units dealt with significant recent injuries, and that trend continues into this week\u2019s clash.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s star and leader on the court, Kayden Mingo reportedly broke his nose in practice and won\u2019t play against the Bruins barring any significant change in status. The Penn State second-highest in scoring, and leader in assists, missed his second consecutive game as Penn State listed him and Tibor Mirti\u010d on the last availability report.</p>\n                <p>Mirti\u010d played all 15 games before his first absence this season, and Rhoades didn\u2019t provide an immediate update on his status.</p>\n                <p>The Bruins listed senior guard Skyy Clark as out in their last contest, as well as wing Brandon Williams. Clark stands as UCLA\u2019s second leading scorer and started in all but one of his 14 appearances, while Williams averages double-digit minutes as a valuable bench two-way contributor.</p>\n                <p>Clark dealt with a hamstring injury in the last few games, and before the previous contest, he got upgraded to day-to-day, meaning his return is inevitable and may even occur against Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Williams may also return soon, as his status is day-to-day due to leg cramps.</p>\n                <p>For UCLA, its leading scorer this season is senior forward Tyler Bilodeau, who averages 17.5 points, shoots the lowest field goal percentage out of its players who average double digits and scored a season high of 34 this year.</p>\n                <p>Joining Sky and Bilodeau are three other double-digit scorers for the Bruins, including Eric Dailey Jr., who leads the squad with 5.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n                <p>Dailey Jr transferred to UCLA after committing to Oklahoma State out of the 2023 class from IMG Academy, the same school and class that Penn State\u2019s Eli Rice came out of and joined Nebraska before heading to Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Over the last four games, Rice has averaged 11.75 points per game and has reached over 20 minutes in each game of that stretch, as he puts together a breakout campaign.</p>\n                <p>Also stepping up over that stretch, and in particular once Mingo went down, is Dilione, who averages a team high 15 points per game, and orchestrates the offense with his desired tempo.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Guy Gadowsky spoke at weekly media on Monday for the first time since before the team\u2019s extended break. While NCAA contests were halted, several Nittany Lions continued to compete abroad over the six-week hiatus.</p>\n                <p>Since opening play in the unofficial second half of the season, the blue and white have earned a series split with RIT, and most recently, are coming off a Big Ten series sweep of Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Injury update</p>\n                <p>Despite the successful series at Pegula Ice Arena, a dark spot on the weekend was the number of injuries sustained by the Nittany Lions. Gadowsky opened the press conference with updates on several blue and white skaters.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI can share that Braedon Ford is going to be out for a significant amount of time,\u201d Gadowsky said.</p>\n                <p>Ford recorded his first goal of the season after opening the scoring for the blue and white early in Saturday\u2019s contest with the Golden Gophers. In the second period, the forward went down awkwardly into the boards and was in visible pain on his way to the locker room.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky listed three other skaters that were \u201cday-to-day, with nothing concrete,\u201d including the team\u2019s points leader, Charlie Cerrato. Cerrato exited Friday\u2019s game with an injury and was then scratched for Saturday. Both Shea Van Olm and Casey Aman were also included in that group.</p>\n                <p>Spengler Cup recap</p>\n                <p>Over the break, five Nittany Lions competed in the Spengler Cup as a part of the first-ever U.S. Collegiate Selects team. Led by Gadowsky, they finished a successful inaugural campaign, complete with a silver medal.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe entire experience was really tremendous,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cSwitzerland is beautiful, the food was great, the atmosphere at the arena was incredible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The performance helped put a spotlight on collegiate hockey after an all-NCAA team defeated some top European talent.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCollege hockey is really, really, good, especially this year,\u201d Gadowsky said.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky brought Cerrato, JJ Wiebusch, Matt DiMarsico, Aiden Fink and Mac Gadowsky over with him, and he spoke on what it meant to share the experience with them.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was awesome, I feel very grateful that we were able to do that, and they deserve it,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to take that many Penn Staters, but I felt they absolutely deserved it, and they all played really, really well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Fink\u2019s return</p>\n                <p>After going down with an injury in late October, Fink made his return to the lineup in the new year and has made an immediate impact.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny, Aiden Fink is an excellent scorer,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cBut when he\u2019s at his best, and the real influence that you\u2019re talking about is how he does it, his motor.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky spoke more on Fink\u2019s work ethic, saying, \u201che consistently gives a lot of himself.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After the forward\u2019s three-assist performance on Saturday, Fink became the fastest Nittany Lion in program history to reach the 100-point threshold, and just the ninth all-time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo one consistently is going to score every game or get points every game, but (Fink) will never not get points because he\u2019s just cruising,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that out of him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Seven-footer Ivan Juri\u0107 started playing basketball as a guard, but then during the summer when he was 15-years-old, he grew over seven inches taller, making a position switch to the frontcourt.</p>\n                <p>Now, Juri\u0107 is in his freshman year at Penn State, where he\u2019s become a standout player with recent performances like 20 points against No. 2 Michigan and nine points and 10 rebounds versus No. 5 Purdue last week.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's a huge part of what we do, and for him to be learning all this going through Big Ten play against the players and teams, says a lot about him and his potential, which is a great word to have tagged to you,\u201d Rhoades said Monday. \u201cHis potential is he has a very high ceiling, but he is very open to understanding and applying it. You see what you can get from him, and he's done a good job being more consistent, and he's still a young guy, so it's gonna be some ups and downs for him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 is averaging 9.1 points and 4.1 rebounds per game through 16 appearances this season. After coming off the bench in the first four games, the big man has started the last 12 games after proving to Rhoades he wouldn\u2019t get in foul trouble on a regular basis.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019s acted as a typical center by battling for boards and going for tough baskets in the paint, but he also brings the ability to stretch the floor to the Nittany Lions. Juri\u0107 has taken 30 3-point attempts this season, knocking down 10 of them, including four made 3-pointers in the last three games.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 said his shooting skill comes from his days playing as a guard. He grew up in Croatia, and he played for the professional team BC Dubrava in the Croatian Premier League during the 2023-24 season.</p>\n                <p>The Zagreb, Croatia, native played for his home country in the 2024 FIBA U18 Eurobasket. He explained what it was like while making the transition to the center, citing his playing experience overseas.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFirst, it was kind of hard, because I still had to grow into my body and put on some weight since I played with grown men back in my country to be able to fight with them,\u201d Juri\u0107 said Monday. \u201cThen I just used what I knew, started passing and shooting.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The 19-year-old has grown into his large frame, as his listed weight with Penn State is 250 pounds.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 was a late addition to Penn State\u2019s 2025 recruiting class, signing in May after playing the 2024-25 season with Sunrise Christian Academy. He was rated as a 247Sports composite 4-star and the No. 154 player overall.</p>\n                <p>With the Nittany Lions, Juri\u0107 gets to work with assistant coach Brent Scott, who played a key role in developing 7-footer and NBA first-round pick Yanic Konan Niederhauser.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think he's helped me with a lot of things,\u201d Juri\u0107 said. \u201cThe thing that worked for me the best is watching film with him, because the great player he was, he can tell me from a different perspective, like the way I do some things. So, yeah, I think every aspect I improved on, he's got a big hand in it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107\u2019s potential as a 7-footer who can play in both the interior and on the perimeter makes him an important player to watch for opposing defenses.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said Juri\u0107 had a \u201chigh-level\u201d performance against the Boilermakers, acting like a guard on the outside at times to help the rest of the offense against the Boilermakers.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought he connected our offense a lot, not just because he rebounded and scored, but just continuing to keep our offense in a flow, and I thought at times Purdue got behind because we played through the big man, even on the perimeter, and it put them at a disadvantage,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI think it was one reason why we had so many layups and scores in the basket in the second half. They're so worried about him away from the basket, it created scoring, scoring lanes for other guys. So he's been doing a very good job.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>With Penn State on a three-game losing streak that saw the team stay close to highly ranked opponents, Mike Rhoades met with the media on Monday to break down the state of the team.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades gave some injury updates on two players in addition to providing a review of a sophomore guard and what response he\u2019s looking for from the team moving forward after the skid.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s more of what Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Injury updates</p>\n                <p>Rhoades gave an update on guard Kayden Mingo and Tibor Mirti\u010d, who both missed last Saturday\u2019s game against Purdue. Mingo will be out for \u201ca while\u201d with a broken nose he endured during practice last Monday, and Mirti\u010d will be sidelined for \u201ca little bit\u201d due to a knee injury he picked up from the Michigan game last Tuesday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHealth's most important for (Mingo) and Tibor,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cJust follow the gotta follow the doctor's orders and all that \u2026 We can't afford any injuries, and we have two that we really need back, but their health is number one, and we just got to keep pushing forward until we get those guys back, hopefully sooner than later.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said on the Penn State Sports Network after the loss to the Boilermakers that Mingo\u2019s surgery for his broken nose \u201cwent well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo is the Nittany Lions\u2019 starting point guard and was the team\u2019s leading scorer before his injury. Mirti\u010d is a rotational big man in the frontcourt, but he started the game against the Wolverines before exiting with an injury.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades emphasized the need for recovery before returning to action.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFind the final rhythm to get it back into the swing of things, and get your feet under and all that stuff,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSo that's part of being a college athlete. Everyone's going to deal with injuries. You just got to do what's best for you and follow the plan from the trainers and the doctors. We have a great trainer. Justin (Pomar) will do a great job with him, getting him and Tibor back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dominick Stewart review</p>\n                <p>Guard Dominick Stewart has 3-point shooting abilities for Penn State, but he\u2019s gone 2-of-18 on deep shots the past three games.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Dominick Stewart)\u2019s got to shoot the ball better,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cHe's a college two guard. He's not shooting it well right now, but we need him to. He has an impact in the game because of his intensity and his approach, and I really appreciate that. I think some of it is just calming down and playing the game and not forcing it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said the team tracks the players\u2019 heart rates during practice, and Stewart is \u201calways\u201d at the top in workload \u201cbecause he doesn't take off reps and how hard he practices.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Stewart is an active defender but has run into foul trouble in recent games, including fouling out against Illinois. He\u2019s averaging 5.8 points and 2.2 rebounds per game with 35% 3-point shooting so far this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe want to get to a point where he's working that hard, but he's calmer, and his workload is still high, but the intensity gets lower,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI just think that comes with experience and allows it, and I really appreciate how hard he's working and his approach, and he cares so much. I love him. We got to get him to come down and play a little, enjoy it more. He wants it so bad. It's not a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Team response</p>\n                <p>Penn State dropped three straight games, but it has remained competitive throughout each contest. Each loss was by a single digit and against three of the top teams in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>While the team is hungry for a win, Rhoades wants the players to focus on what they can still control.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI just want to keep our guys getting better,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cProcess, process, process, and then hopefully, and I believe in it, that the results will come. It's frustrating. It's hard. I feel for the guys, but it is what it is.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said the Nittany Lions \u201cbattle\u201d and that the players care about the \u201cright stuff,\u201d but the team just has to keep improving.</p>\n                <p>Penn State hosts UCLA on Wednesday before traveling to Maryland on Sunday, and it won\u2019t face another ranked opponent again until Feb. 2, when it visits No. 2 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe can't control what's next, and we can't worry about what's going to happen,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI know that's hard, especially for 18 to 22-year-old competitive athletes, but I do know this, and I believe this, that if you just try to stack days upon days, and you will be all about the process, you'd be all about trying to get better. You're putting yourself in a better position and get the results you want. I really believe that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

He had held that role since the 2022 season, and beginning in 2024, he was on former Penn State head coach and current Eagles head coach Bill O\u2019Brien\u2019s staff.</p>\n                <p>The Jackson, New Jersey, native led improvement in Boston College\u2019s rushing attack after averaging 63.3 yards per game in 2022. The Eagles ran for above 100 yards per game in each of the last three seasons, including 198.3 yards per game in 2023 and 166.4 yards per game in 2024.</p>\n                <p>Prior to getting the running backs coach role at Boston College, he was a recruiting advisor for the Eagles in 2021. He\u2019s an alum of St. Peter\u2019s Prep, joining recruiting coordinator Naz Oliver as Penn State staffers who have connections to the New Jersey area.</p>\n                <p>Huggins was briefly the running backs coach at UMass in 2021 before getting hired by Boston College, and he never coached a game with the Minutemen.</p>\n                <p>Earlier in his career, Huggins was a wide receivers assistant at Buffalo in 2020, when the Bulls averaged 191 passing yards a game. He spent time with his high school alma mater as an offensive assistant the year prior.</p>\n                <p>After a three-year stint with Somerville High School in New Jersey as an offensive and defensive assistant from 2016-18, Huggins completed a fellowship with the Miami Dolphins during the 2019 season.</p>\n                <p>Notable running backs coached</p>\n                <p>This season, Huggins helped running back Turbo Richard rush for 749 yards and nine touchdowns on 145 carries, giving him an average of 5.2 yards per carry.</p>\n                <p>Richard then entered the transfer portal, and the production he showed helped him gain an offer from national championship contender Indiana, where he will transfer to.</p>\n                <p>Prior to Richard, Huggins had running back Kye Robichaux at Boston College. Robichaux ran for over 700 yards in each of his two seasons as an Eagle, including averaging 4.8 yards per rush in 2023. He scored 18 rushing touchdowns across 2023-24.</p>\n                <p>Robichaux went on to sign an undrafted free agent deal with the Detroit Lions following the 2025 NFL draft.</p>\n                <p>Playing days</p>\n                <p>Huggins began his collegiate career at Rutgers. He was a 247Sports composite 5-star and the No. 28 player nationally, No. 4 running back and No. 1 player from New Jersey in the 2011 class.</p>\n                <p>With the Scarlet Knights, Huggins appeared in 32 games across three seasons, tallying 261 carries for 842 yards and nine touchdowns. He ran for a career-high 179 rushing yards on 41 attempts in a 10-3 win over Cincinnati in 2012.</p>\n                <p>Huggins missed his senior year at Rutgers due to injury, transferring to Northern Iowa ahead of the 2015 season. He made three starts and rushed for 216 yards and two touchdowns across 14 games with the Panthers.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Sam Krasowitz | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>While Gracie Merkle has been one of the most impactful players for Penn State over the year and a half she has been in State College, that fact was amplified in Sunday\u2019s loss against Illinois.</p>\n                <p>Despite a 24-point performance along with seven rebounds from the junior center and strong showings from other guards, weak second and fourth quarters allowed the Fighting Illini to defeat the Lady Lions 92-76.</p>\n                <p>While Merkle had her strong night on efficient 8-of-12 shooting while going 80% from the free-throw line, being on the bench during key points of the game hurt the Lady Lions, with little help from those who were subbing in for her. Backups Maggie Mendelson and Rachel Okokoh combined for just three points and five rebounds in 19 total minutes, while Merkle put up her numbers in 20.</p>\n                <p>While the scoring numbers were not there from the backup bigs, players like Kiyomi McMiller and Nyla McFadden helped lead the way in Merkle\u2019s absence with 19 and 12 points, respectively.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have two different versions of Penn State women\u2019s basketball,\u201d Coach Carolyn Kieger said. \u201cWhen Gracie Merkle is in the game, who is the most efficient low block scorer in the country. Then we have our other lineup that creates scoring in different ways.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Merkle was just one of three players with a positive plus-minus, as the Lady Lions outscored Illinois by five with her on the court. Mendelson and Okokoh had a combined -14, giving up multiple runs and eventually allowing the Fighting Illini to close out the game.</p>\n                <p>Merkle\u2019s early fouls put Penn State in this position, picking up her first two early in the first and second quarter, followed by two straight that left her sidelined for most of the third. Mendelson and Okokoh quickly substituted in and out for each other, neither finding a rhythm or making a strong impact defensively, leading to Illinois\u2019 92-point performance.</p>\n                <p>Merkle played just 20 minutes while her fellow stars McMiller and Moriah Murray played 40 and 36, respectively.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Merkle) has to stay out of foul trouble. I loved today that she was 8-for-10 from the line. She\u2019s been working really hard on her free throws, but we have to keep her on the floor and (she) has to be disciplined for her teammates,\u201d Kieger said.</p>\n                <p>One bright spot for Kieger\u2019s squad in Sunday\u2019s contest was turnovers. While it averaged 20.4 turnovers and it was an area of struggle last year, it only committed 11 against Illinois and even won the turnover battle.</p>\n                <p>However, strong shooting from Illinois and the absence of Merkle\u2019s presence contributed to the Lady Lions\u2019 loss Sunday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe finally took care of the ball\u2026 We still got blown by. We forced 21 turnovers, but they shot almost 60% on our home floor, which isn\u2019t going to win games,\u201d Kieger said.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Reinvigorated defense leads Penn State men\u2019s hockey to sweep of Minnesota",
    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Despite a fair amount of early-season success, Penn State men\u2019s hockey entered its mid-season break in search of an identity and consistency.</p>\n                <p>As part of that search, coach Guy Gadowsky implored his defense to \u201cstep up\u201d and make a greater impact during games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe used to get a ton of production from our defense, and we want to get back to that,\u201d Gadowsky said.</p>\n                <p>This weekend against Minnesota, his sentiment came to fruition. Penn State\u2019s defense controlled the Golden Gophers on both ends of the ice and led the Nittany Lions to the first home sweep of their rival since 2019.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky mainly hoped to see the defenders contribute more in the offensive zone, a feat which they accomplished this weekend. Prior to the last two games, Jackson Smith marked the only back-end starter consistently setting off the goal light. Smith continued to shine against Minnesota, scoring a goal on a wrist shot on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>His surge coincides with a change of approach from his defensive partner, Jarod Crespo, who put his name on the stat sheet more this series as well, accounting for eight shots on goal in the series.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think (Crespo) and Smith have a really good thing going,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing with a lot of synergy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Cade Christenson, returning from injury, became the other defenseman to notch one into the net this weekend and seemed to\u2019ve been the key to figuring out Penn State's defensive pairings.</p>\n                <p>Christenson missed the first half due to an injury, but his size and playmaking, when available, transformed the Nittany Lions\u2019 defense's style over two Big Ten games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust because of his presence, he brings confidence to the team,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe keeps getting better every period, so I can\u2019t wait for the next game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Overall, Penn State\u2019s defense contributed 28 shots on net against Minnesota. However, their play in their own end was the real catalyst for an impressive weekend.</p>\n                <p>The Golden Gophers only scored two goals against the Penn State goaltenders, and while Josh Fleming and Kevin Reidler each made their marks, the D-Line's performance made their jobs easier than they\u2019d been this season. For Reidler, he faced more shots than Fleming, but with a lot of help in front by his defenders.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always hard when you don\u2019t have a lot to do,\u201d Reidler said. \u201cI prefer games like today, more fun, more space.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The defenders who didn\u2019t put up offensive numbers were running the paint in the defensive end, matching Minnesota\u2019s physicality and blocking lanes throughout the weekend.</p>\n                <p>Christenson\u2019s defensive partner, Mac Gadowsky, emerged chief among them, blocking 4 shots in Sunday\u2019s game. He and Nolan Collins used their size and physical prowess to check a Minnesota team that came out swinging after Saturday\u2019s shutout.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe knew they were coming out ahead, and it was a bit of a wake-up call.\u201d Lev Katzin said. \u201cIt took us a little while to get to that, but once we were there, they couldn\u2019t play with us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Carter Schade stood as the final player making a tangible impact, contributing multiple breakout passes between the zones throughout the games and staying in front of Reidler throughout Sunday\u2019s contest.</p>\n                <p>Schade single-handedly fended off multiple rebound opportunities and tip-ins by staying physical in the paint.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Schade) was a single breakout machine,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cNot only did he play physical like he always does, but he skated the puck well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The healthy defensive core allowed Penn Star to control the game and play relaxed, which kept them out of the penalty box. The Nittany Lions only spent 12 minutes in the Penalty box, with just 10 of those being penalty-killing minutes.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defense guided the identity that the Nittany Lions struggled to establish in the first half. Continued performances like the one the core put up against Minnesota will be a key in the blue and white\u2019s quest to return to the Frozen Four this spring.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur whole defensive core has been solid back there,\u201d Luke Misa said. \u201cIt\u2019s just good to have all of them back there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Yet this season, Penn State triumphed 311.300-297.600, in a win where it increased the margin of victory to one of the largest in recent meetings.</p>\n                <p>On the floor, the blue and white narrowly won in Rec Hall, with a 51.500-49.900 score. Every participating athlete scored below 13, except Penn State\u2019s Shaun Smith and Matthew Underhill, who helped pull the blue and white into the lead.</p>\n                <p>On the pommel horse, the trend of narrow wins continued. Maddox Pabellon led the Army\u2019s efforts on the day and in the event, with a highest score of 13.850, yet couldn\u2019t top the Penn State unit.</p>\n                <p>The run is where Penn State pulled ahead, with a six-point differential on the rings. Underhill once again reached the 13-point threshold, joined by Luke Esparo, while no Army gymnasts reached such a figure.</p>\n                <p>The vault is where Army posted a much more consistent score, yet Penn State\u2019s pair of 14-point scores by Underhill and Kellen Ryan saw it again edge out the Black Knights. On the parallel bars, the Nittany Lions again won the event, with Esparo, Kacper Garnczarek and Eliran Ioscovich all reaching 13 points. Not one Black Knights gymnast reached such a feat, putting the clean sweep in play for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The horizontal bar saw Penn State complete its string of dominance with a sweep, as it again won by a four-point margin. Ryan led the way with a high score in the event with 13.200.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>The blue and white face Army again, this time on their turf, when the Black Knights host the West Point Open from Jan. 16 to 17, with multiple participating schools.

However, it didn\u2019t have an answer for Berry Wallace, who scored eight straight points for Illinois.</p>\n                <p>Freshman T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante came on the court following a foul and instantly made a mark, putting the blue and white up by two.</p>\n                <p>Despite standing at 6-foot-5, the Fighting Illini targeted Maggie Mendelson on back-to-back plays, adding another four points to their score.</p>\n                <p>As Wallace continued to score, totaling 12 points through the first quarter, Penn State went silent, going nearly three minutes without any action. However, the script flipped at the end of the first period, as Illinois went three minutes without scoring while the Lady Lions brought it to a one-point game.</p>\n                <p>Moriah Murray opened the second quarter with a triple, followed by another score from Wallace to tie things up at 23.</p>\n                <p>After Cleante missed a shot, she capitalized on the following drive on defense with a steal and score to ignite a 6-0 Penn State run, capped off with McMiller\u2019s 11th point of the game.</p>\n                <p>However, the Fighting Illini came back even stronger with an 11-0 run of their own, holding the Lady Lions scoreless for over four minutes.</p>\n                <p>Penn State struggled through the final minutes of the first half, scoring just 12 points in the quarter as Illinois extended its lead to 11 points.</p>\n                <p>Both teams turned the ball over to start the second half before Gracie Merkle used her 6-foot-6 frame in the paint to earn her first and-one of the game.</p>\n                <p>However, Wallace came back just as strong in the second half, scoring her third triple to record 20 points, which Nyla McFadden quickly negated with another Penn State and-one.</p>\n                <p>After turnovers were a big issue through the first two months of the season, the Lady Lions kept the ball under control against Illinois, recording only 11 turnovers as they created more scoring opportunities.</p>\n                <p>Merkle\u2019s fouls were an issue, however, as she got her fourth foul with nearly 15 minutes left to play, limiting her time on the court through the rest of the period.</p>\n                <p>Despite playing strong defense in the paint, the Lady Lions struggled to guard the 3-point line, often leaving Illinois players open, including 6-foot-3 Cearah Parchment, who drained a triple to make it a seven-point game.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Illini ended the third quarter on a strong 9-2 run, and that momentum carried into the start of the final period, going 4-0 to start the fourth quarter.</p>\n                <p>While Merkle scored her fifth shot in the paint and Murray her second triple of the day, the Lady Lions couldn\u2019t stop the bleeding as Illinois made it a 20-point game with six minutes left.</p>\n                <p>As both teams scored, including Merkle, who reached 20 points on the day, Penn State ultimately fell, remaining winless in conference play and moving to 7-10 on the year.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions travel to Columbus to face No. 19 Ohio State at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Penn State listed Amiya Evans on the Big Ten availability report.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

It landed a score of 49.125, which put it in a comfortable decision. Monahan opened for Penn State, who started off strong with a score of 9.775. Johanson was next and brought a score of 9.750.</p>\n                <p>Kaempfer and Latronica came in hot with scores of 9.825, and Leary and Cash led the rotation, both with a score of 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions headed to beam and scored a total of 48.950 on beam, with both Monahan and Latronica leading with scores of 9.825. With her score, Monahan topped her 2025 beam score of 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Kramer and Ashley Maul both started off their scoring on beam, and both grabbed a 9.775.</p>\n                <p>Kalea McElligott followed with a score of 9.750, and Amani Herring scored a 9.725.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Floor was the last event of the afternoon for the Nittany Lions and they opened with Leary and, minus a step off the mat, her routine got a score of 9.650 to start off the rotation.</p>\n                <p>Monahan nailed her routine, scoring a 9.800, and Maul followed, also scoring a 9.800. Misiura took home a score of 9.775</p>\n                <p>Kramer got a strong 9.875, and McElligot finished off for Penn State and led the scoring on floor with a 9.900.</p>\n                <p>Floor ended and gave the blue and white a strong start to the season, taking a win over the Bulldogs of 196.225-193.850.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State takes on Illinois in Champaign, Illinois, at 8 p.m. Friday.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

He then suffered a rib injury late in the summer at the U23 World Championships.</p>\n                <p>It was unknown how long Barr would be out after missing the start of the season, but now, he\u2019s back to seemingly full strength.</p>\n                <p>Barr made his return to Rec Hall on Saturday, making his home-dual debut to open up conference play against Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t feel well, but it\u2019s one of those things just trying to keep it cool, and obviously we have a really good trainer here from back home,\u201d Barr said.</p>\n                <p>Once Barr made it back to the United States, it was all recovery in preparation for the collegiate season.</p>\n                <p>He didn\u2019t start the season, instead it was Connor Mirasola, who started and showcased his abilities, before Barr returned and proved why he was the preseason No. 1 wrestler at 197 pounds.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOnce we got back, we got right through it with (trainer Daniel Monthley) and doing everything that we could, and trusting in the Lord\u2019s timing for my career, my life and it was good,\u201d Barr said.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt sophomore returned to the mat at the Collegiate Wrestling Duals in early December, where he dominated to victories. In those matches, he was wearing a more protective singlet that kept his upper body covered up due to the rib injury.</p>\n                <p>However, in his first match of 2026, Barr was back to his regular singlet, showcasing he\u2019s back to full strength.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel great. It was good. It was tough,\u201d Barr said. \u201cJust really fired up for the rest of the season, really excited and more grateful than ever. When you don\u2019t get to compete for a while and need to go out there and wrestle in Rec Hall, it makes you really grateful.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Barr\u2019s first matchup of the calendar year wasn\u2019t like most. He wrestled his high school teammate, Remy Cotton. Barr and Cotton both wrestled at Davison High School, where the two combined for five state titles.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lion wrestled in four weight classes in high school, and faced off daily against Cotton, bringing the two back to the good ole\u2019 days.</p>\n                <p>In the rematch of the daily scraps, Barr dominated to an 18-3 tech fall in a weight class neither wrestled at in high school.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI had told one of our coaches there, I probably spent more time wrestling him than anybody my whole life,\u201d Barr said.</p>\n                <p>When two wrestlers face off that often, it often leads to close matches. However, Barr continued to prove he\u2019s the top wrestler at 197 pounds, withholding his top ranking which he received at the beginning of the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my partner, like main partner for four years straight,\u201d Barr said. \u201cSo, it was cool to be able to do it in Rec Hall, Rutgers vs. Penn State and really grateful that I got to compete tonight, and it\u2019s pretty cool to do it against an old teammate.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

Lilledahl took an 8-3 decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 3, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>133: No. 5 Marcus Blaze vs No. 24 Dylan Shawver</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze tested himself against an All-American in the form of Dylan Shawver. Neither man got the other to move throughout the first frame. Shawver nearly reversed Blaze in frame two, but it ended up as just an escape. Blaze secured the first takedown of the match after that by spinning around Shawver at the speed of light. He passed one minute of riding time before the frame expired.</p>\n                <p>Blaze extended his lead into major decision territory with two third-period takedowns, and Rec Hall erupted for the true freshman after his 12-2 victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 7, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>141: Braeden Davis vs Tahir Perkins</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis returned to the lineup for Penn State for the first time since it was announced that he\u2019d redshirt for the 2025-26 season.</p>\n                <p>Davis returned to the mat for Penn State for the first time this season after Aaron Nagao went down with another injury. Davis burned his redshirt to compete against Tahir Perkins.</p>\n                <p>Davis looked like he hadn\u2019t lost a step wrestling unattached; he took down Perkins three times in round one. The second round was slower, with just an escape from Perkins after Davis crossed two minutes of riding time. Davis notched two more takedowns to secure the 18-7 major decision victory in his return.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 11, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness vs Devon Magro</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness continued the trend of moving quickly, getting two takedowns in the first half of the first period. After that takedown, Van Ness managed to flip Magro, momentarily holding him down and securing four nearfall points. Van Ness racked up twelve points and 1:15 of riding time when the whistle blew on the round.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness turned Magro over again in round two, this time hooking his neck and after a twenty-second struggle, secured the pin.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 17, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>157: PJ Duke vs Easton Doster</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke took on 4-0 Easton Doster. Duke notched the first takedown nine seconds into the match. He kept the pace up, notching three more in the following minute, but tallying barely any riding time. Duke continued to let Doster back up in search of a techfall, which he successfully earned after his first takedown of round two, winning 19-4.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 22, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink vs Ryan Ford</p>\n                <p>Ryan Ford shocked the crowd by securing the first takedown against Mitchell Mesenbrink, without Mesenbrink visually leaving his feet. Mesenbrink responded with a takedown of his own seconds later, securing four nearfall points while Ford\u2019s face turned red in his arms. Mesenbrink got another four-point nearfall before hooking Ford\u2019s leg and finishing the first-round fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 28, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines vs Jordan Chapman</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines immediately lifted Jordan Chapman into the air, which set the tone for a dominant victory. He secured a quick first takedown and a second one before Chapman entered concussion protocol with 25 seconds on the clock. Chapman returned a couple of minutes later to complete the bout.</p>\n                <p>The return didn\u2019t bode well for Chapman, as after two more takedowns, Haines secured Penn State\u2019s third pinfall of the day.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 34, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>184: No. 4 Rocco Welsh vs No. 15 Shane Cartagena-Walsh</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh proved he is in the upper tier of the 184 weight class against Shane Cartegena-Walsh. Welsh secured three first-period takedowns, leading Cartagena-Welsh to stall throughout the second period. Welsh received a stall point in round three to win 13-3.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 38, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr vs No. 18 Remy Cotton</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr wrestled in his first home match of the season against Remy Cotton, walking out to his signature \u201cI Love It\u201d by Icona Pop. His match matched the energy of the music, as he nearly pinned Cotton in the first period. Barr led 7-0 as time expired.</p>\n                <p>After an escape in round two, Barr took down Cotton again and looked to turn Cotton after grabbing his leg, but the referee called it off for head danger.</p>\n                <p>After another takedown and another danger call, Barr elected to let Cotton stand up, leading 14-3 in the third to hunt for a tech fall. He secured it with a final takedown and riding time, winning 18-3.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 43, Rutgers 0</p>\n                <p>285: No. 15 Cole Mirasola vs No. 21 Hunter Catka</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola stepped to the mat last, looking to secure the shutout in the closest match on paper of the evening. The first period lived up to that billing, with no points awarded for either man.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola quickly escaped in the second period and nearly got taken down with 45 seconds to go, but quickly latched onto Catka\u2019s calf to land a stalemate call.</p>\n                <p>It took just three seconds for Catka to escape in round three, and Mirasola took control to launch a takedown that blew the roof off of Rec Hall. Catka stood up with 40 seconds on the clock and failed to return the takedown.

    "description": "<p>Penn State won its opening match against Mount Olive last night, kicking off a new season with a 3-1 victory.</p>\n                <p>This afternoon, the Nittany Lions moved upstairs to the South Gym to take on Manhattan as the wrestling team occupied the main gym in Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>In the second match of Mark Pavlik\u2019s final season at the helm, it was No. 13 Penn State that left the smaller court with the win, earning a 3-0 victory.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white quickly scored two points in the first set, but the Jaspers struck back thanks to a couple of service errors and a nifty kill that put six points on the board for each team.</p>\n                <p>Points were traded back and forth for most of the first set, with Penn State\u2019s Sean Harvey responsible for four points off of kills halfway through the set.</p>\n                <p>A Carter Dittman ace made it 17-14 in the Nittany Lions\u2019 favor, but Manhattan was closing in with back-to-back kills that tightened the contest.</p>\n                <p>The Jaspers were forced to take a timeout down 22-18 with the set slipping away from them.</p>\n                <p>Manhattan\u2019s attack efforts brought it closer, but it just wasn\u2019t enough, and Penn State won the first set 25-21.</p>\n                <p>The second set started the same way with the two sides trading blows, but the Jaspers got up to an early 3-2 lead after a pair of kills from Kasen Owens and Max Larcheid an error on a Penn State serve.</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-7 Harvey earned another kill to make it a 7-4 advantage and in the process, picked up his sixth kill of the afternoon, still in the early stages of the second set.</p>\n                <p>Penn State put an end to Manhattan\u2019s gaining momentum thanks to a service error and an attack error that put the blue and white up 18-13 with the end of the second set in sight.</p>\n                <p>Once again, the Jaspers took a timeout with a seven-point Nittany Lion advantage looking insurmountable.</p>\n                <p>Thanks to Dittman and Harvey earning another pair of kills and a Matthew Luoma service ace, Penn State captured the second set, stifling the Jaspers 25-16 as it inched one set closer to a sweep.</p>\n                <p>History repeats itself, and apparently so did each set. The third set started out with points coming in rapid succession for each squad until Manhattan eventually found itself on top with a 6-5 advantage, thanks to Penn State\u2019s Owen Rose missing the mark for an attack error.</p>\n                <p>Penn State jumped back up 10-8, though, after back-to-back plays from Gabriel Gaige to force an attack error from Larcheid, he then followed up with a kill.</p>\n                <p>Some more back-and-forth play saw consecutive Chase Marston aces that allowed the Jaspers to tie it at 12 points a piece, but six consecutive errors let Penn State jump back up to a 17-14 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Manhattan once again took a timeout after falling into a 19-14 hole after back-to-back Harvey kills, which put him up to 14 on the afternoon on 16 total attempts.</p>\n                <p>The Jaspers tightened it up right at the end but just couldn\u2019t catch the Nittany Lions as they captured the third set 25-20 to sweep Manhattan and cap off its opening weekend with a 2-0 record.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State is back in action when it returns to Rec Hall\u2019s main gym at 7 p.m. on Thursday to take on St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Penn State men\u2019s basketball suffers another close loss to ranked opponent at hands of No. 5 Purdue",
    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State hit the road, continuing its three-game ranked-opponent stretch and leaving Pennsylvania for the first time in five games, as No. 5 Purdue served as the worthy foe.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions entered banged up, both mentally and physically, suffering back-to-back heartbreaking close defeats to then-No. 20 Illinois and No. 2 Michigan, in a stretch where they also didn\u2019t play at full strength.</p>\n                <p>With those absences, the blue and white trudged out a first unit against Purdue that resembled little of the other starting fives previously this season. Earning the nod for Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad were Freddie Dilione V, Dom Stewart, Eli Rice, Josh Reed and Ivan Juric.</p>\n                <p>That group all appeared in starting roles before, though not together, as the No. 4 KenPom and Evan Miya-rated Boilermakers pose a daunting task that almost all statistical formulas, media voters and analysts note as a top-five team in the nation.</p>\n                <p>For the Nittany Lions, only one of its rostered players appeared in West Lafayette before Saturday, Sasa Ciani, and the forward didn\u2019t crack the starting lineup, let alone appear in the contest, until Penn State endured a Purdue scoring run.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions earned the first bucket of the game, courtesy of a Rice three pointer, and fought back against everything that Purdue offered. At the midpoint of the first, only a score separated the two schools.</p>\n                <p>Yet, almost all of the Boilermakers\u2019 offensive effort, Braden Smith orchestrated behind his game-high 10 points, which were double his next-highest teammate and triple the highest Penn State scorer.</p>\n                <p>Smith typically isn\u2019t a primary scorer for Purdue; his 9.5 assists entering against the Nittany Lions were an NCAA-leading figure, and pace him to challenge Bobby Hurley\u2019s collegiate assist record.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offense, in which all but Stewart scored by the ten-minute mark of the first half, showed a collective effort that hung in there and prevented either team from pulling ahead.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 notched tough, physical buckets in the paint and stood out with a game-high five rebounds, as his play started to decide the tempo for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>When the first half closed down, Purdue led 45-44, and repelled every single answer Penn State answered with on offense with its own Boilermakers score. For the blue and white, it looked solid but needed a little more to take the lead, especially on defense.</p>\n                <p>Smith led scoring at the half for either squad with 17 points, and also supplied seven assists. Reed, Rice and Tunca all tied for eight points at the half on perfect shooting for Penn State, only trailing Dilione, who led the blue and white with a single point more.</p>\n                <p>Both squads nearly shot 60%, but the Nittany Lions held a five-point advantage in 3-point percentage.</p>\n                <p>Smith started the second half on fire, contributing both with playmaking and scoring to a 10-3 run, which gave Purdue its largest lead of the game with the score at 55-47.</p>\n                <p>No. 2 Michigan, which Penn State took down to the wire only four days ago, suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Wisconsin, while the Nittany Lions were actively attempting to pull off such an upset against the Boilermakers. Yet Purdue continued to pull away, as the lead grew to ten.</p>\n                <p>Smith reached a twenty-point double-double performance, joined by three other Boilermakers who reached double-digit scoring as the last ten-minute mark approached. Despite the efficient Penn State team-wide offensive approach in the first half, only Tunca and Dilione reached double-digit scoring at this point.</p>\n                <p>Both squads stood relatively evenly matched in how those buckets came, except Penn State\u2019s large advantage in scoring off the bench. Marginally better scoring efficiency and turnover rates helped the Boilermakers obtain their lead, however.</p>\n                <p>That trend continued, with Purdue routinely snagging off blue and white passes and translating on the other end not just with fast break buckets, but with and-ones.</p>\n                <p>Purdue\u2019s lead extended to 14 through its defensive hot streak, and it looked to cruise to victory barring any major Penn State run. The Nittany Lions' only highlight came from a Dilione downtown stepback to cut the lead to nine.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions ultimately couldn\u2019t pull that run out, as they fell 93-85, giving Penn State a winless conference record after five Big Ten games.</p>\n                <p>Dilione finished with a team-high 25 points on 50% shooting, while Rice and Tunca followed in double digits, with the team shooting efficient marks. Stewart, despite shooting 0-for-4 from the field and leading Penn State in fouls, also posted the best plus-minus rating.</p>\n                <p>For Purdue, Smith finished with 26 points and 14 assists, while fellow starter Oscar Cluff followed with 23 points, only missing one shot.</p>\n                <p>Availability Report</p>\n                <p>Penn State listed Kayden Mingo out again for the contest against Purdue, the second straight game the Farmingdale, New York native missed, and Mike Rhoades said he\u2019d be out for \u201csome time,\u201d giving no exact timeline on return, in line with Pennsylvania state regulations.</p>\n                <p>Joining Mingo on the report was Tibor Mirti\u0107, who entered as out against Purdue, marking the first game of the season in which the forward missed.</p>\n                <p>Rounding out the lengthiest Availability Report of the season for Penn State is Reggie Grodin, who already reportedly will use his redshirt.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>After facing three consecutive ranked opponents, the Nittany Lions host UCLA at the BJC on Wednesday, Jan 14, at 8:30 p.m. The Bruins are 10-5 overall and 2-2 in the Big Ten, placing them in the middle of the pack in the conference and just inside the top-40 in KenPom's ratings.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Steven Pavelka | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The No. 4 Nittany Lions returned to Mercyhurst Ice Center Saturday with a chance to sweep their conference series against in-state rival Mercyhurst in their fourth meeting of the season. After a rebounding shutout win in their last matchup, Penn State wants to keep the momentum going.</p>\n                <p>The White and Blue dropped its third game out of the last four to Mercyhurst in a 4-3 overtime loss.

Up until mid-December, Merkle averaged over 20 points per game.</p>\n                <p>However, the 6-foot-6 center has also led the nation in efficiency from the court with 75.1% shooting, making her a reliable target anywhere in the paint.</p>\n                <p>In the Illinois starting lineup, however, is 6-foot-1 forward Berry Wallace, the sister of former Penn State forward Bexley Wallace.</p>\n                <p>Wallace consistently ranks among the Fighting Illini's top scorers this season, averaging 18.1 points per game, including eight 20-plus-point games.</p>\n                <p>The last time the two squads matched up, the Lady Lions fell 67-55 at Illinois.

While Murray scored double digits in six games, she also posted less than five points in several games.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State to earn its first conference victory, it\u2019ll need production from those athletes to create more options on the offensive end.</p>\n                <p>Defensively, the Lady Lions must watch for more than just Wallace. The Fighting Illini arrive in Happy Valley with four double-digit scorers, including another tall forward in Cearah Parchment, who will keep Penn State\u2019s frontcourt busy.</p>\n                <p>Between Maggie Mendelson \u2014 who started playing less than three weeks ago \u2014 and Amiya Evans \u2014 who earned the start on Thursday against Michigan but didn\u2019t score \u2014 the blue and white need an answer down low against Illinois.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State opens its 2026 season inside Rec Hall at 2 p.m. on Sunday, and for the occasion, Army marches to Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions finished fifth in the NCAA Championships last season, the first time they accomplished a feat since 2023, and despite a fifth-place finish, there remained many positives from that outing.</p>\n                <p>With that factor, though, coach Randy Jepson\u2019s unit appears poised to build on last season\u2019s finish, boasting an incredibly versatile 16-athlete roster that retained key upperclassmen performers such as Kacper Garnczarek, one of just two members of the blue and white named to the 2026 Big Ten Gymnasts to Watch list, while also welcoming an influx of six freshmen.</p>\n                <p>Although the outlook is positive, Jepson\u2019s squad still appears to face an uphill battle, with the Big Ten coaches poll predicting a fourth-place finish among the five conference schools that have a team in the sport.</p>\n                <p>While the outlook appears mixed, with proven contributors pairing with high-upside newcomers, the limited competition suggests a strong run could propel Penn State to recreate last season\u2019s successes.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions start 2026 with an opponent that could provide all the juice needed to hit the ground running, as Penn State holds an undefeated 16-0 record against Army all-time entering the season opener.</p>\n                <p>The Black Knights and Penn State last met amidst that 2025 Nittany Lions\u2019 run, also in the first two-team meet of that season, and the Nittany Lions triumphed with a score of 316.9 to 306.5. While the scale historically tips all time in the blue and white\u2019s favor, and that continued last year, that meet was the only one between the schools to be decided by ten points or fewer since a 2019 victory where Penn State won by six.</p>\n                <p>Both the top point earners on the floor in last year\u2019s contest with the Black Knights return for Penn State, in Matt Underhill and Akseli Karsikas. Yet on the pommel horse. Josh Karnes led Penn State in a unit that narrowly edged out Army, but he departed the team after his four years and has begun Olympic preparation and won\u2019t compete in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Although that departure might nag at the Nittany Lions, it still contains a versatile leader in Kellen Ryan, who excels at both the rings and the vault.</p>\n                <p>Those mark all the key returnees for Penn State from last year\u2019s meeting with Army, except Ian Rabual, the only member of a parallel bars squad that earned a perfect sweep.</p>\n                <p>For Army, its key gymnast to watch is Maddox Pabellon, the Event Champion on pommel horse in the meet last season, and a mainstay in the Black Knights squad that finished tenth in NCAA Championships last season, the highest in program history.</p>\n                <p>The Houston native is a team captain for the Black Knights and earned a plethora of accolades last season, including 2025 All-ECAC First Team, 2025 CGA Regular Season All-American honors and 2025 West Point Open Pommel Horse Champion.</p>\n                <p>The West Point Open kicked off both the Army and Penn State 2025 seasons, and in 2026, it\u2019ll be the next event the two schools compete in since this opener. The two-day outing is scheduled for Jan. 16 and 17, with formal opponents to be announced shortly.</p>\n                <p>In the 2025 event, Penn State finished second behind Ohio State, with Navy, Springfield, William and Mary and Army rounding out the field.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State jumped back into conference play on Friday night, hosting Minnesota for the two teams\u2019 second and final series of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white shut the Golden Gophers out 3-0 in the first game of the weekend.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions struggled continuously with slow starts all season, but in their first Big Ten series of the new year, they were the ones to strike first.</p>\n                <p>Both teams appeared evenly matched to start the first period, but the blue and white gained momentum early in front of the crowd at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Freshman forward Luke Misa broke the ice about five minutes into play, after redirecting a shot from the point from defenseman Carter Schade that found its way past Golden Gophers goaltender Luca Di Pasquo.</p>\n                <p>Penn State continued to maintain much of the offensive possession after the goal and doubled its lead about seven minutes later.</p>\n                <p>Misa tallied his second point of the night, finding sophomore defenseman Cade Christenson in the high slot, who fired a diving one-timer into the back of Minnesota\u2019s net. After missing the first half of the season due to injury, Christenson's impact in the lineup has been felt, with his second goal in just three games back for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Despite a last-minute attempt by the Golden Gophers as the clock ran out, goaltender Josh Fleming stood tall in net, and Penn State went into the locker room with a 2-0 lead, holding the 19-9 edge in shots through the first 20 minutes.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota ramped up its offense in the second period, but the Nittany Lions countered with another strong period of their own.</p>\n                <p>The Golden Gophers welcomed back LJ Mooney and Brodie Ziemer after the forwards\u2019 recent World Junior Championship campaign for Team USA, and both had chances throughout the period, but neither could get through Fleming.</p>\n                <p>After a relatively quiet 20 minutes on both sides, it looked like Penn State would hold on to its two-score lead, but with five seconds left on the clock, the home team added another.</p>\n                <p>After forward Reese Laubach fired a shot that trickled past Di Pasquo, sophomore JJ Wiebusch was there to tip in the loose puck and send the Nittany Lions into the second intermission up 3-0.</p>\n                <p>Unlike many Big Ten contests this season, neither team was overly physical, with over 50 minutes of play without a penalty called. That changed with about eight minutes to go, after Wiebusch was called for a 10-minute misconduct, ending his night.</p>\n                <p>The Golden Gophers had one of their best chances of the night just seconds after the penalty, after forward Beckett Hendrickson was all alone in front of the Nittany Lion net and tried to stuff the puck past Fleming, but the goaltender held strong.</p>\n                <p>The intensity grew as the minutes ticked down, and the game saw its first power play, after Penn State forward Lev Katzin was called for roughing with about five minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota couldn\u2019t get much going on the man-advantage, however, and the blue and white\u2019s Big Ten-leading penalty kill held on to the shutout.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions got a power play of their own after a scrum along the boards ended in matching penalties for both teams, and an additional 10-minute misconduct for Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ran out the remaining minutes of the final frame and took the first game of the series 3-0.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State continues play at Pegula Ice Arena, hosting Minnesota for a rematch Saturday night, slated for a 6 p.m. puck drop.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>The final season for Penn State under coach Mark Pavlik began with a home matchup against Mount Olive.</p>\n                <p>The No. 13 Nittany Lions took down the Trojans in a 3-1 victory behind all-around hitting from the team.</p>\n                <p>Mount Olive stuck with Penn State throughout the first set, despite the Nittany Lions scoring the first two points of the match on kills from right-side hitter Miller Truby and middle blocker Gaige Gabriel.</p>\n                <p>The teams traded points, with Penn State never giving up the lead. A kill from Trubey made the blue and white the first to 15, holding a 15-13 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Trojans made it close late in the first set, after a Maksim Kazanov kill made it 19-18 in the Nittany Lions\u2019 favor.</p>\n                <p>It never got closer as setter Michael Schwob and middle blocker Owen Rose stuffed a swing, ending the first set on a 25-20 Penn State win.</p>\n                <p>Trubey led the way with six kills in the opening set as Penn State hit .395 in the set. Mount Olive hit .367, but couldn\u2019t hold down the Nittany Lion attack.</p>\n                <p>Things remained the same in the second set, as both teams traded points. Penn State extended its lead in the second set on a 5-0 run, going ahead 15-8, and becoming the first team to reach the always important 15 point mark.</p>\n                <p>Holding a 17-11 lead, Penn State went on another run to extend its lead. A 4-0 run from the Nittany Lions behind the blocking of the front row. The block unit forced two straight attack errors, and a solo block from Rose put the blue and white up 21-11.</p>\n                <p>Mount Olive stormed back to make things interesting in the second set. A 5-0 run from the Trojans on two points from opposite hitter Kory Grant closed the gap to just six points, with Penn State leading 23-17.</p>\n                <p>That run extended to 8-0 after Grant\u2019s second ace of the run. Penn State\u2019s lead slimmed to just three after leading by 11 prior to the Trojans\u2019 extended run.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back kills from Schwob put away the set. The junior showcased his offensive abilities despite being a setter, closing out the set. Penn State took the second set 25-20, and inched one set away from a sweep.</p>\n                <p>Despite losing the first two sets, Mount Olive erupted, gaining more momentum to begin the third set.</p>\n                <p>Pavlik made the switch at setter to senior Jaxon Herr. The Grand Canyon transfer got off to a slow start, allowing the Trojans to get out to the lead. After leading 11-10, Mount Olive went on a 5-0 run after three attack errors from Penn State hitters.</p>\n                <p>After Penn State ended the run, the Trojans responded with a 3-0 run behind kills from Kazanov and Matthew Ekberg, leading Mount Olive to a 19-11 advantage.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions attempted to crawl back, taking two points for every point the Trojans scored. Penn State forced a timeout after a double block from Herr and Gabriel.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, Mount Olive put away the set on a kill from Christos Savvidis, giving the Trojans the set victory, 25-20. Penn State still held a 2-1 lead in the match.</p>\n                <p>Penn State picked up momentum after inserting Jaidyn Bethel into the lineup. The redshirt freshman replaced Matthew Luoma at an outside hitter spot and provided a spark both offensively and defensively.</p>\n                <p>Leading 8-5, the blue and white erupted to a 4-0 run, rounded out by an ace from Rose. Like the second set, Penn State never gave up the lead.</p>\n                <p>Mount Olive could never respond after the 12-5 start. Despite consecutive points from the Trojans, Penn State immediately responded, putting to sleep any thought of a run.</p>\n                <p>Gabriel gave Penn State 20 points on the set, putting it in the \u201cred zone,\u201d just five points away from the match victory, holding a 20-15 lead.</p>\n                <p>After a lengthy review with Penn State holding set point, the review went in favor of the Nittany Lions, ending the match with a 25-18 victory in set 4.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took the match 3-1, advancing to 1-0 on the first weekend of the season.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State remains at Rec Hall, but plays in the South Gym to host Manhattan at 3 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State concluded its stretch of games against top-10 teams suffering its first sweep of the season to Ohio State. While their toughest stretch of games may be finished, the Nittany Lions remained on the road for a conference series against an in-state rival in Mercyhurst.</p>\n                <p>Maddy Campbell found herself starting in net for the fourth time in her freshman season as Katie DeSa was kept out of the lineup for the second-straight game.</p>\n                <p>In what was the third matchup of the season between the two conference rivals, it was Campbell who took the spotlight as the Nittany Lions recorded their 10th shutout of the season, beating the Lakers 3-0.</p>\n                <p>Both teams created chances on the offensive rush to open the contest. Although neither chance resulted in points on the board, the two sides showed quick transition and immediate offensive zone pressure put on both goalies.</p>\n                <p>It wasn\u2019t until just under nine minutes left in the opening frame that Penn State was given a chance to break the ice as Kate Donegan headed to the box. Ultimately resulting in a change on the scoreboard, the Nittany Lions spent almost the entire powerplay in the offensive zone.</p>\n                <p>The opening period was played very differently between the teams compared to the most recent game. Penn State opened that game with three opening goals. However, in Friday\u2019s contest, the scoreboard was filled with zeros, and the shots were tied at six apiece.</p>\n                <p>Nearly six minutes removed in the middle frame, the Nittany Lions broke the ice. Tessa Janecke fed a pass to Nicole Hall from the boards. Hall quickly shot a wrister from the slot that beat Magdelena Luggin, giving the Stockholm, Sweden, native her eighth of the season.</p>\n                <p>The Lakers quickly developed momentum in an attempt to score as a flurry of shots were put on Campbell. Ultimately, all were saved by the freshman goalie, keeping the lead in Penn State\u2019s favor halfway through the second period.</p>\n                <p>Campbell stopped all 27 shots in her fourth career start, most of which came in bunches through the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>Much of the second period was kept quiet due to the stellar performance in net for the Nittany Lions. On the other end of the ice, Penn State attempted to double its lead with quick transitions and occasional offensive zone threats. Ultimately, the horn sounded to conclude the second period, leaving the Nittany Lions with a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>It only took heavy traffic and multiple wrap-around attempts for Penn State to add to its lead as Taya MacDonald took a wrap-around rebound behind the net herself and snuck one in on the right post.</p>\n                <p>Not even two minutes later, the Nittany Lions were caught with too many players on the ice after a line change gone wrong. An opportunity for the Lakers to answer. To no prevail as the penalty kill of Penn State suffocated offensive chances, matched with an exceptional performance in net.</p>\n                <p>Rains of stick taps poured into Mercyhurst Ice Center after Sofia Nuutinen found herself alone behind the Penn State defense, one-on-one with Campbell, ultimately being denied by the freshman\u2019s blocker.</p>\n                <p>The Lakers weren\u2019t done there as an offensive surge developed off of just about four rebound attempts. The suffocating pressure was quickly extinguished by Courtice, Ontario, native.</p>\n                <p>Danica Maynard put the dagger into the game between the two storied rivals off a quick shot from the left faceoff circle. Penn State remains undefeated in conference play as the clock hit triple zeros with the score 3-0.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>DeSa was not listed in the lineup for the second-straight game. Matilde Fantin was not listed in the lineup, as well.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Both teams return to Mercyhurst Ice Center at 1 p.m. on Saturday for the conclusion of the series.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Penn State women\u2019s gymnastics opens 2026 season by welcoming Yale",
    "author": "Caroline Riley | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State gymnastics opens its 2026 season Sunday with a double dual meet at Rec Hall, as the women\u2019s team hosts Yale and the men\u2019s team faces Army at 2 p.m. The meet offers an early opportunity for both Nittany Lions squads to start the season 1-0, but for one potentially more than the other.</p>\n                <p>Sunday\u2019s matchup is a great opportunity for the Penn State women\u2019s gymnastics team to test out potential lineups from practice to consider possible adjustments before taking on the heart of its Big Ten schedule after facing the Bulldogs.</p>\n                <p>Last season, Yale scored in the 195.000+ range only once, in mid-March. Meanwhile, the blue and white scored above the 195.000 range in every meet but one last season. However, Penn State shouldn\u2019t count the Bulldogs out.</p>\n                <p>Despite the blue and white\u2019s undefeated record against Yale, every meet is a challenge to uphold it. In many ways, the head-to-head matchup can take a back seat to early-season score-building as the Nittany Lions look to improve their NQS from last season later in the year.</p>\n                <p>The lineups for both teams are far from locked, as injuries and good training days could impact each decision up until Sunday. Moreover, with Penn State's slew of new talent and the return of some injured stars from last season, how head coach Sarah Brown configures her depth will be a developing storyline throughout the season.</p>\n                <p>On vault, both teams expect to rely heavily on Yurchenko fulls, which carry a 9.95 start value. Penn State may also feature senior Ava Piedrahita\u2019s Omelianchik on vault or perhaps an upgraded performance from some of the freshmen.</p>\n                <p>Clean form off the table and stuck landings will be the difference maker between two teams closely matched in their maximum start values.</p>\n                <p>Uneven bars were a strength for the Nittany Lions last season, but key gymnasts like Gabbie Gallentine and Cassi Barbanente graduated. Their departure leaves opportunities for new faces to step in or for older gymnasts who never made the lineup before.</p>\n                <p>Fortunately for Penn State, incoming freshman Ava Cash was a National Bars Champion in 2022 and could play a role in that lineup moving forward.</p>\n                <p>Beam, always precarious, poses a unique challenge in this meet for both teams as they battle nerves about opening the season. While Penn State returns several experienced beam workers, coach Brown needs to balance veteran reliability with the development of younger gymnasts.</p>\n                <p>Yale doesn\u2019t consistently score as high on beam as some other events. Last season, at their top meet of the year, the Bulldogs\u2019 top beam contributor posted just a 9.800. Increasing that score will be important for keeping pace with the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>The floor exercise should be one of the best head-to-head matchups of the meet. Penn State struggled to consistently deliver strong performances on the event last season, at one point posting a low 48.575.</p>\n                <p>The Bulldogs, on the other hand, managed to tie their fifth-highest score in program history on the floor last season with a 49.225. If the meet comes down to the last rotation, a strong floor showing by Penn State might be something to watch for.</p>\n                <p>Some key gymnasts with event-winning potential for Yale to keep in mind include Hailey Kriz on the uneven bars, Hana Strause on beam, and Gigi Sabatini in the all around. For the blue and white, there are many storylines to keep an eye out for.</p>\n                <p>The significant returns of Jessica Johanson, Amani Herring, and Piedrahita after season-ending injuries could provide an immediate boost. How Brown utilizes Kalea McElligott within lineups, particularly in anchor roles, will also be worth monitoring.</p>\n                <p>Finally, what lineups the freshmen break into and the scores they manage to put up so early in the season are something to keep an eye on. On Sunday, the Nittany Lions will not only compete but also evaluate depth and begin to shape lineups designed to keep the program competitive in a demanding Big Ten field.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After breaking the record for longest win-streak in NCAA division I wrestling, Penn State returns to Rec Hall to start its Big Ten wrestling for this season. The Nittany Lions will take on Rutgers on Saturday at 4 p.m.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how each wrestler matches up against the Scarlet Knights.</p>\n                <p>125 Pounds: No. 2 Luke Lilledahl vs No. 29. Ayden Smith</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl has wrestled up to the standard he\u2019s capable of so far, but he\u2019s the No. 2 wrestler for a reason. He hasn\u2019t put up a ton of points in his most recent matches, totaling 10 in his last two matches.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl has shown improvements with his defense as the season has gone on. In the close matches, his defense has been crucial to his victories.</p>\n                <p>Ayden Smith has an impressive 9-2 record so far this season. The Allentown, Pennsylvania, native will return to his home state and try to pull off a major upset over Lilledahl.</p>\n                <p>133 Pounds: No. 5 Marcus Blaze vs No. 24 Dylan Shawver</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze has been stellar this season. He has a perfect record of 10-0 and has beaten a few top-10 opponents, including Tyler Knox of Stanford. As a freshman, Blaze is already being talked about in the national championship conversation.</p>\n                <p>Dylan Shawver has lost his last two matches and will try to start 2026 the right way. The senior has an 11-4 record so far this season, and will look to bounce back from his current losing skid.</p>\n                <p>141 Pounds: No.9 Aaron Nagao/Nate Desmond vs No. 5 Joey Oliveri</p>\n                <p>This is the big question mark for the Nittany Lions. It looked like Aaron Nagao would be back, but he got re-injured at the Southern Scuffle. Cael Nasdeo also got hurt.</p>\n                <p>This leaves Nate Desmond, who was originally looked at as a 125-pounder, but has been wrestling at 141 the last few weeks. He\u2019s 6-0 in limited action at the weight class, but could earn that starting job with Nagao battling injuries.</p>\n                <p>Whoever is wrestling will face a tough task in Joey Oliveri. Oliveri is the best wrestler in the Scarlet Knights lineup, continuing to climb the rankings.</p>\n                <p>149 Pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness vs No. 31 Andrew Clark</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness has been on a different level this season. He\u2019s been dominant in every match he\u2019s been in this season, going undefeated so far.</p>\n                <p>Clark has continued to fall down the rankings and needs to get a win to change his momentum. Van Ness is expected to dominate in this matchup and continue to sit at the top of the weight class.</p>\n                <p>157 Pounds: No. 4 PJ Duke vs No. 32 Tony White</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke has been a pleasant surprise for Penn State and is in a similar situation as Blaze, becoming a dominant wrestler in his respective weight class. The freshman\u2019s coming off a victory against then No. 5 Daniel Cardenas.</p>\n                <p>Tony White is another member of the Scarlet Knights that has been trending in the wrong direction. This match looks like it could be lopsided, and could end up that way if Duke gets off to an aggressive start.</p>\n                <p>165 Pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink vs No. 21 Andrew Barbosa</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesebrink has been firing on all cylinders since the beginning of last season. He is one of the best wrestlers pound-for-pound in the country and has continued to show it this season.</p>\n                <p>Andrew Barbosa has the chance to face Mesenbrink, but Mesenbrink should get the victory in this match the same way he does in his other matches, by a large margin.</p>\n                <p>174 Pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines vs No. 9 Lenny Pinto</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines has taken the last two matchups against Lenny Pinto. Haines has been dominant on the mat for the entire season and is trying to win his first national championship at 174 pounds.</p>\n                <p>Pinto\u2019s most recent loss was to No. 7 Carter Schubert. Pinto has had a solid season so far, but hasn\u2019t been able to defeat the wrestlers in front of him.</p>\n                <p>He will need to change that and defeat the wrestler all the way at the top of the weight class, while Haines will look to continue his momentum that he\u2019s built this season.</p>\n                <p>184 Pounds: No. 4 Rocco Welsh vs No. 15 Shane Cartagena-Walsh</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh hasn\u2019t been scoring as much as expected, but he\u2019s been able to get victories, though it's been inconsistent. In his last two matches he\u2019s won 19-4 and 5-1, but Welsh\u2019s defense has been elite.</p>\n                <p>Shane Cartagena-Walsh is another very good defensive wrestler. This match could be low scoring and might come down to the final seconds.</p>\n                <p>Welsh has flashed more offensively, than Cartagena-Walsh this season and will need to do so to get the win in this match.</p>\n                <p>197 Pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr vs No. 18 Remy Cotton</p>\n                <p>Even though he missed the start of this season, Josh Barr has shown why he\u2019s the top ranked wrestler at 197. Barr just dominated No. 3 Stephen Little at the Southern Scuffle this past weekend, whereas Remy Cotton lost via tech fall by Seth Shumate 19-5.</p>\n                <p>If Barr gets off to an aggressive start, this match could end early.</p>\n                <p>285 Pounds: No. 15 Cole Mirasola vs No. 21 Hunter Catka</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola has had an up and down season. He has struggled with heavyweights that are bigger than him. Hunter Catka could be a good bounce back match for Mirasola, but it won\u2019t be an easy task.</p>\n                <p>Catka has put up 19 and 20 points in his last two matches. While the opponents weren\u2019t the same caliber wrestler as Mirasola, he\u2019s been winning big against weaker competition.</p>\n                <p>This match contains two wrestlers that are pretty even and the match could go either way.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

Penn State is averaging 77.7 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will be without star Kayden Mingo again after he sustained an injury prior to the loss against the Wolverines.

He got the starting nod in Mingo\u2019s absence against the Wolverines and dropped 17 points.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is undefeated this season when it scores 80 or more points, but 1-6 when scoring less.</p>\n                <p>With the Boilermakers allowing less than 70 points a game and the Nittany Lions being without their leading scorer, the younger, more inexperienced blue and white have a challenging top-5 road test on its hands.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades\u2019 squad\u2019s remaining schedule loosens up ever so slightly, with games against bottom of the conference Northwestern and Maryland on the horizon. However, a likely loss to the Boilermakers means time is ticking for Penn State to gain any sort of momentum moving forward.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Sam Simonic I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The start to Big Ten play hasn\u2019t treated the Lady Lions well. In welcoming a top-ten opponent to State College, their record failed to improve.</p>\n                <p>After a uniquely convincing start to the season, Penn State showed it might have something to prove. However, behind the 4-0 start came lots of growing pains as the young team hasn\u2019t quite clicked.</p>\n                <p>Any talk of jet lag following the holiday festivities was a convenient scapegoat after the Lady Lions lost to Wisconsin days ago. Thursday\u2019s contest was a different story. Penn State\u2019s Rec Hall welcomed another sizable loss, as Penn State fell to Michigan 105-65.</p>\n                <p>The game was over before it even started.</p>\n                <p>Heading into the tilt, the Wolverines\u2019 recent slump gave Penn State a gleam of hope. Despite the No. 9 ranking next to its name, Michigan proved vulnerable as the team displayed subpar shooting numbers.</p>\n                <p>In a loss to Washington and a close win over Minnesota, the Wolverines\u2019 three-point shooting dipped to 21 percent in each of their last two games. Maybe the Lady Lions got too comfortable scouting that.</p>\n                <p>Slow starts have continuously haunted coach Carolyn Kieger\u2019s team. Once more, it fell victim to that against Michigan. Mila Holloway kick-started the offensive onslaught with a three-pointer, which essentially set the tone for the rest of the game.</p>\n                <p>It wasn\u2019t just the offense, but the defense too, that starred behind Michigan\u2019s hot start. Penn State went on a nearly five-minute first-quarter drought in which the Wolverines took a 20-2 lead. That gap created enough room for Michigan to run away with the victory before the fight began.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions would\u2019ve needed a near-perfect showing to encore their first win since Dec. 20. T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante got Penn State in the scoring column to start, but Gracie Merkle laid the foundation for a comeback as the team fired back in the second frame.</p>\n                <p>Nevertheless, each short run the Wolverines neutralized with a counter-run even more vast. Michigan\u2019s Te\u2019Yala Delfosse, Brooke Quarles Daniel and Holloway combined to score 41 points in the first half. The three-headed monster outscored the Lady Lions by ten points and terrorized the team in transition.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s 17 turnovers at the break were an issue of its own, as the team had continued to give away free points. Despite the deficit, Penn State kept the Wolverines\u2019 leading scorer, Olivia Olson, relatively quiet.</p>\n                <p>It didn\u2019t seem to matter as virtually everyone got invited to the scoring party for the maize and blue. Penn State didn\u2019t play a consistent offensive approach, as the Lady Lions failed to use their height in the paint with Merkle and Aimya Evans on the court together.</p>\n                <p>Michigan widened its lead through each of the four quarters as Penn State had few options to stop the aggressive guard attack. The blue and white found limited bench options as Kieger switched up lineups in the final frame.</p>\n                <p>Trial and error had been a significant theme for Penn State in its 2025-26 season, yet the Big Ten continues to eat at any lineup Kieger offered so far.</p>\n                <p>Michigan finished with 44 bench points and five players in double figures. It was the highest scoring output the Lady Lions have surrendered all year.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Viktoria Ranisavljevic entered Thursday's contest with an undisclosed injury and therefore didn\u2019t appear against Michigan. The Massagno, Switzerland, native logged 18 minutes and scored five points in the Lady Lions\u2019 last game against Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State gets a chance to turn the page on Sunday, Jan. 11, when it hosts the 13-3 Illinois Fighting Illini.

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>No. 1 Penn State returns to the mat for Big Ten play on Saturday against No. 16 Rutgers for the start of the Nittany Lions\u2019 2026.</p>\n                <p>During the dual-season hiatus, multiple Penn State wrestlers competed across different tournaments and events, including the Southern Scuffle and the Bob Kauffman Memorial Open.</p>\n                <p>Cael Sanderson met with local media to discuss decisions at weight classes and the dominance of his young Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he had to say.</p>\n                <p>141-pound decision</p>\n                <p>Aaron Nagao made his return to the mat after suffering an injury at the Black Knight Invitational in November. However, Nagao had to medically forfeit out of the Southern Scuffle, making the Penn State weight class up in the air for the future.</p>\n                <p>It wasn\u2019t a thought for Sanderson that Nagao would return to the starting lineup when he recovered from the injury, but after suffering a setback, Nagao\u2019s availability is in question.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe just wanted to get back on the mat and see how he would feel, and that was kind of the idea,\u201d Sanderson told local reporters via a video from Zack Seyko of Locked on Nittany Lions. \u201cObviously, things didn\u2019t go as we kind of hoped for him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to this, the decision was seemingly to have true freshman Nate Desmond fill in before his five dates ran out to maintain his redshirt. Now, Desmond could burn the redshirt and be the starter at the class, having wrestled three dates thus far.</p>\n                <p>Desmond has proven himself to be a capable starter, already holding a 6-0 record, with three of the wins coming at 141 pounds.</p>\n                <p>He was listed at 125 pounds, and made that weight for the Black Knight Invitational. However, he wrestled up two weight classes, weighing in around 138 pounds each time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNate Desmond did a great job filling in when he moved up to 41, even having wrestled 25 this year,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe\u2019s made a lot of progress, obviously, he\u2019s been one of the best wrestlers since he was a little kid, but he\u2019s been doing a really good job, really good mindset, attitude, getting better in all regards.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Desmond having been the starter at 141 pounds the last three matches, he could easily be the choice. However, there\u2019s another wrestler who\u2019s currently on the path to redshirt that could insert himself back into the lineup, a place he\u2019s been the past two seasons.</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis was on track to redshirt. He dominated in the Kauffman Open, winning the weight class with ease, while wrestling unattached. He could provide a more veteran presence, with experience at the Big Ten Tournament and the NCAA Championships.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDavis has kind of been on standby, and he competed last week,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cJust trying to see\u2026 definitely an option we have.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rutgers rivalry</p>\n                <p>Despite Rutgers never having beat Penn State, there\u2019s still a geographical rivalry between the two programs.</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness is from Somerville, New Jersey, which is just 12 minutes from Piscataway. For Rutgers, Mason Gibson and Devon Magro went to high school at Bishop McCort, which is 81.5 miles from State College.</p>\n                <p>The two programs are constantly competing for recruits, and geographically are close enough to each other to fit a rivalry.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey always bring fire and passion, and coach (Scott) Goodale is one of the best. He does a really good job,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the history, or whatever the past is, but we always enjoy wrestling them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With the matchup against Rutgers, it restarts the Big Ten schedule, with the dual season kicking into high gear for the final two months.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will only wrestle Big Ten teams from here on out, as the Big Ten championship is in the Bryce Jordan Center in March.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously, start with Rutgers this week, it\u2019s always a great match,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cBig Ten schedule\u2019s always a lot of fun.\u201d</p>\n                <p>157-pound depth</p>\n                <p>Tyler Kasak was the Big Ten champion last season at 157 pounds, and entered the NCAA Tournament as the No. 1 seed. Despite this, Kasak is expected to hold his redshirt this season, opening the door for younger wrestlers.</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke and Joe Sealey have both proven that they\u2019re capable wrestlers. Duke\u2019s redshirt will officially be burnt if he wrestles against Rutgers, with Sealey already redshirting last season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAll three of those guys are incredible wrestlers and have a great mindset and (are) team players,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cThey see the big picture. You don\u2019t come to Penn State if you\u2019re not a big picture kind of person.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Duke, Sealey and Kasak could all be viable options for Penn State to earn another Big Ten title at the weight class, and compete for the national championship. However, Duke\u2019s dominance could place him in a tier above the two depending on the rest of the season. With all this, the picture is still bigger than just national championships.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to be world Olympic champions. It\u2019s just a different mindset that maybe people aren\u2019t going to understand,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cJoe Sealey wants to be a world Olympic champion, PJ Duke wants to be a world Olympic champion, obviously, Tyler Kasak wants to be a world Olympic champion.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s hockey faces conference foe Minnesota at Pegula Ice Arena this weekend.</p>\n                <p>The series will serve as a momentum boost for two teams returning star players for the World Juniors as they look to separate themselves in college hockey\u2019s deepest conference.</p>\n                <p>The Golden Gophers and Nittany Lions are tied in the Big Ten at 4-4-0, apiece. Minnesota is just 8-10-1 overall compared to Penn State\u2019s 12-6-0 record, but has faced a tougher non-conference strength of schedule.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is coming off a split series against RIT, while Minnesota tied Bemidji State in its last outing. The teams split their matchup against each other earlier this year, as well as the two prior series in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>The teams will faceoff at Pegula Ice Arena at 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Both games will be televised on Big Ten Network.</p>\n                <p>Stars</p>\n                <p>Big-name talent will be on display and highlighted in this matchup. To start, the Nittany Lions will regain the services of Gavin McKenna after his stint in the World Junior Championships. McKenna recorded 14 points in the tournament en route to a bronze medal. He reunites with Aiden Fink for the first time since Fink\u2019s injury early in the season.</p>\n                <p>Speaking of Fink, the first-line winger is only three points away from becoming the fastest Nittany Lion to reach 100 career points. Alex Limoges is the current record holder with 102 games to reach the mark. Fink will play in his 86th and 87th career games this weekend. Fink would be the ninth Nittany Lion to reach the milestone.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota returns two members of Team USA this weekend, including team captain Brodie Ziemer and Pittsburgh native, and cousin of NHL star Logan Cooley, LJ Mooney. Ziemer and Mooney are two of 13 NHL draft picks on the roster for the Golden Gophers.</p>\n                <p>Ziemer and Brody Lamb are tied for the team\u2019s lead in points at 19 apiece, while five other Golden Gophers sit at double-digits for the season.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will need its stars to counter, as only six members of the current roster have scored goals against Minnesota. The leaders are Reese Laubach and Matt DiMarsico, each with six career points against the Golden Gophers.</p>\n                <p>Goaltending has been the Achilles heel for Minnesota throughout the first half, with neither Luca Di Pasquo nor Nathan Airey clocking a goals-against-average under 2.99 or save percentage above .905. Kevin Reidler only gave up one goal to Minnesota and is in line for at least one start this weekend.</p>\n                <p>Starting strong</p>\n                <p>Penn State will need to start hot in order to secure victories in these two games. Against RIT, the Nittany Lions started slow on the road and ended up getting shut out, before scoring the first goal on Sunday en route to a 7-3 drubbing of the Tigers.</p>\n                <p>On the year, Penn State is 8-1 when scoring the first goal, with the lone loss coming to these Golden Gophers on the road.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will also look to draw penalties early, as Minnesota runs the second-worst penalty kill in the country, killing just 62.4% of opposing power plays.</p>\n                <p>Return of the roar</p>\n                <p>On Sunday, despite a high-scoring victory over RIT, the energy in Pegula Ice Arena was noticeably softer.

Lane\u2019s departure means all four of Penn State\u2019s main safeties from 2025 won\u2019t be in Happy Valley next year, while Denmark had always been a promising young talent.</p>\n                <p>Outside visitors</p>\n                <p>Penn State has been hosting transfer portal targets for the past few days, with a few notable names making their way to State College.</p>\n                <p>FIU defensive tackle Xion Chapman was on campus Tuesday as the Nittany Lions look to continue their overhaul on the defensive line. Chapman had 15 tackles, three tackles for loss and one forced fumble in 2025.</p>\n                <p>The Allentown, Pennsylvania, native started his collegiate career at Lackawanna College, where former Penn State safeties Ji\u2019Ayir Brown and Jaquan Brisker began their careers as well.</p>\n                <p>Following Chapman\u2019s visit, the defensive tackle posted that Penn State offered him a scholarship.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State running back Makhi Frazier was also at Penn State on Tuesday as Campbell looks to rebuild that room as well. As of now, the Nittany Lions have just four running backs on board with two transfer commitments from James Peoples and Carson Hansen along with Tikey Hayes and Quinton Martin Jr., both of whom were with the blue and white in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Frazier led the Spartans in rushing yards this year with 520, making seven starts and playing nine games.</p>\n                <p>Other players that had visits scheduled for Tuesday include Colorado defensive back Noah King, South Dakota running back LJ Phillips and Wyoming defensive tackle Lucas Samsula.

    "author": "Keira Albert I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s a busy weekend ahead for Penn State as it opens the season with back-to-back games.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions open their 2026 season against the Mount Olive Trojans in Rec Hall at 6 p.m. Friday. They then face the Manhattan Jaspers in Rec Hall\u2019s South Gym at 3 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Mount Olive</p>\n                <p>With both teams starting their seasons on Friday night, it could be anyone\u2019s game.</p>\n                <p>The Trojans went 20-4 last season, losing only two games on the road all year. While the two teams didn\u2019t share many similar opponents, the blue and white held a noticeably different 15-16 record.</p>\n                <p>While the two teams played very different schedules last season, they shared an opponent in Loyola Chicago.</p>\n                <p>Loyola Chicago swept Mount Olive 3-0, and it concluded the match with 30 kills and 17 errors.</p>\n                <p>When the blue and white played the same team, it lost 1-3. Similar to the Trojans, the blue and white totaled 39 kills and 16 errors during that match.</p>\n                <p>While the teams posted wildly different records, they played a similar game against this shared opponent, which could suggest a close match on Friday.</p>\n                <p>And where one team struggles, the other seems to flourish.</p>\n                <p>Penn State totaled 1,252 kills last season, while Mount Olive tallied a lesser total with 1,038. However, while the blue and white finished with 563 errors on the year, the Trojans traded with the favorable 333.</p>\n                <p>In terms of the offensive attack, it seems to be a fairly even matchup when looking at the top players on each roster.</p>\n                <p>Mount Olive\u2019s Kory Grant finished the year with 284 kills and 324.0 points. He led the team in both categories. Entering his senior season, Grant poses a threat to the blue and white, especially with the absence of Penn State\u2019s Will Kuhns.</p>\n                <p>Kuhns finished the year with 330 kills and 390.5 points, leading the team in both categories just as Grant had. The difference, however, is that Kuhns graduated and won\u2019t take the court on Friday.</p>\n                <p>But with a player like Matthew Luoma returning, the blue and white still have the statistical advantage. The redshirt junior had 294 kills and 351.5 points last year.</p>\n                <p>However, it looks like the defense leans in Penn State\u2019s favor.</p>\n                <p>Owen Rose led the Penn State squad with 115 blocks on the year. Similarly, Ryan Merk led with 209 digs. With both redshirt seniors returning, the duo poses a threat to any opponent.</p>\n                <p>The leader in blocks for the Trojans last year was Holden Maryott. But he tallied only 79 on the year, much fewer than Rose. However, Maryott won\u2019t be in the lineup on Friday, as he also graduated, which could play in the blue and white\u2019s favor.</p>\n                <p>However, last year\u2019s dig leader, Luca Colombo, bested Merk\u2019s numbers with 234 on the year.</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s game could easily be a close one in the season opener.</p>\n                <p>Manhattan</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s game could continue the trend and prove to be an interesting one.</p>\n                <p>In July of 2024, Manhattan College announced the addition of a men\u2019s volleyball team to the school, with its launch scheduled for the 2025-26 season.</p>\n                <p>This fact means that the Jaspers are debuting their team to the world against the blue and white in what they are calling their Inaugural Match.</p>\n                <p>The Manhattan team is very young, consisting primarily of freshmen. In fact, 13 of the 16 players on the roster are freshmen.</p>\n                <p>However, that\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t a talented team.</p>\n                <p>One of the few upperclassmen, Wojtek Nowak, is a standout.

    "author": "Daily Collegian men's volleyball staff",
    "description": "<p>Penn State men's volleyball's 2026 season will be remembered regardless of its outcome, and the preseason outlook only suggests more hype.</p>\n                <p>Keira Albert: 14-13</p>\n                <p>The loss of a key playmaker like Will Kuhns definitely presents the potential to impact overall performance this season. However, the blue and white still have the keys to produce a winning season with the remaining talent on the roster.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white will open the season with three straight wins against Mount Olive, Manhattan and St. Thomas Aquinas. However, its win streak gets broken against Lewis, making them 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Heading into the series against McKendree, the Nittany Lions will win one and lose one. But just like last year, they\u2019ll lose both games to Hawai'i, putting Penn State at an even 4-4.</p>\n                <p>Going into the Saint Francis series, Penn State leaves the court with a full sweep, putting them on a two-game winning streak.</p>\n                <p>The streak will yet again be broken, however, during the Princeton series. Here, the blue and white will lose one game and win the other, putting them at a solid 7-5.</p>\n                <p>The next three games, two of which are against Harvard and one against Merrimack, will put the blue and white on a three-game winning streak and cement their record at 10-5. Ultimately, Long Beach State breaks the streak again in their match against Penn State.</p>\n                <p>This loss will trigger a series of losses against Pepperdine, USC and Ohio State, putting the Nittany Lions at a rocky 10-9.</p>\n                <p>To close out the year, Penn State will leave the NJIT series with one win and one loss, but will lose both the Charleston games. There will be a brief turnaround with back-to-back wins against Sacred Heart, but it will ultimately have to settle for one win and one loss in the George Mason series.</p>\n                <p>By the end of the regular season, the Nittany Lions will end with a winning season at 14-13.</p>\n                <p>Chase Mitchell: 15-12</p>\n                <p>Penn State recently earned predictions to finish first in the EIVA and once again win the conference to claim its 38th title.</p>\n                <p><a title=\"Penn State men&#039;s volleyball coach Mark Pavlik to retire after 2026 season\" href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/tncms/asset/editorial/bd250891-6eee-49c1-b62c-bace478778d7/\" target=\"_blank\">In the last year under longtime coach Mark Pavlik</a>, libero Ryan Merk and middle blocker Owen Rose will be key pieces to make a run for another championship.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions roll at the start of the season, winning their first three matches with ease.</p>\n                <p>The Jan. 17 matchup against Lewis will be the first test of the season, but I think the blue and white pull it out and get the victory, likely in a fifth set.</p>\n                <p>Penn State then heads to Lebanon, Illinois, to take on McKendree. I think this will be the first falter of 2026 for the Nittany Lions, but I don\u2019t see them losing both matches. I think they\u2019ll split the series and leave it at 5-1.</p>\n                <p>To end January, the 2021 and 2022 National Champions come to Rec Hall. I do think Penn State loses both matches to Hawaii, but the optimist in me really wants to say they\u2019ll split.</p>\n                <p>Pavlik and the blue and white then have a two-match series against Saint Francis, with one match in Rec Hall and the other in Loretto, Pennsylvania. I\u2019ve got Penn State winning both of these to move to 7-3.</p>\n                <p>By the time the Nittany Lions face USC, I think they\u2019ll be 10-7 after splitting with Princeton and Harvard and a loss to the defending National Champions, Long Beach State.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019ve got Penn State falling to the Trojans and Ohio State to slide to 10-9. I also think it\u2019ll lose a couple of matches that it should win\u2013 I could see losses to NJIT or Charleston.</p>\n                <p>I think the Nittany Lions close out the season by splitting the series against George Mason, hopefully heading into the postseason with momentum after ending 15-12.</p>\n                <p>George Keene: 13-14</p>\n                <p>After finishing 15-16 last season, the Nittany Lions finish this season with the same fate.</p>\n                <p>Penn State should get off to a fast start and grab four early wins against Mount Olive, Manhattan, St. Thomas Aquinas and Lewis.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions then take on McKendree on the road, and I have them splitting the series, making them 5-1 heading into their first real test of the season.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back matchups with Hawaii will be a turning point for the blue and white. After getting eliminated by Hawaii in the NCAA tournament last year, I don\u2019t think Penn State can compete and steal a win. I think they will drop both matches and split the following Saint Francis series, dropping them to 6-4.</p>\n                <p>Despite being picked to finish at the top of the EIVA, conference matchups always become decided in the margins and the Nittany Lions will need to grab two wins against George Mason, NJIT, and Sacred Heart to finish above .500.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions start conference play against Princeton and Harvard. I have them splitting matches with Princeton and losing both to Harvard, leaving them 7-7 overall.</p>\n                <p>After a brief stretch of conference play, the Nittany Lions face Merrimack, Long Beach State, Pepperdine, USC and Ohio State. With four of the five matches being away from Happy Valley, I have Penn State winning against Merrimack and dropping the following four matches, putting them at 8-11.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white then closes out the regular season with eight in-conference matches. I think Penn State will split with NJIT, split with Charleston, split with Sacred Heart, and win both against George Mason to end the season.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "George Keene | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Despite capturing another EIVA championship this past season, Penn State endured a 15-16 record and second-round exit to No. 2 Hawaii in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.</p>\n                <p>As the Nittany Lions enter the 2026 season with plenty of new faces, coach Mark Pavlik has a variety of options when it comes to the frontline.</p>\n                <p>Bennett Wilson, OH</p>\n                <p>In his freshman season, Wilson appeared in one match in which Penn State swept Saint Francis. In his sophomore year, Wilson should have a larger opportunity to use his 6-foot-4 frame and help bolster the Nittany Lions' front line, especially with the lack of collegiate experience in front of him.</p>\n                <p>Kyle Fagan, OH</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-4 freshman joins Penn State off an impressive high school career. Fagan attended Ward Melville Senior High School, where, in his 2023 season, he earned numerous accolades: 1st Team All-Conference, 1st Team All-County, 1st Team All-Region, and 1st Team All-State. Fagan also played for Academy Volleyball of Long Island. Fagan is one of several young players on this team who will get an opportunity to earn their spot early.</p>\n                <p>Tristan Hassell, OPP</p>\n                <p>Entering his freshman season, Hassell is another young player who may not see significant playing time. However, he gets the opportunity to learn from two experienced opposite hitters, Matthew Luoma and Miller Trubey.</p>\n                <p>Christian Couch, OPP</p>\n                <p>Couch, like Hassell, will compete for court time in 2026. Couch attended Bel Air High School and fills out the competition for the hitting unit for next season. He redshirted his 2025 season, and this year marks his first real opportunity to make an impact in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Jaidyn Bethel, OH</p>\n                <p>Bethel used his redshirt season this past year. Out of high school, AVCA named Bethel to the 2024 AVCA Boys High School All-American Watch list.</p>\n                <p>Matija Grbi\u0107, OH</p>\n                <p>Entering his first season in Happy Valley, the Zabalj, Serbia, native stands at 6-foot-6 and is another freshman who bolsters their outside-hitter depth. Grbi\u0107 spent two seasons with SIR Safety Perugia Juniores and three seasons with Calzedonia Verona Juniores.</p>\n                <p>Sean Harvey, OH, OPP</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-7 redshirt sophomore didn\u2019t see any action this past season, but likely sees a larger workload this year. Before Penn State, VolleyballMag.com named Harvey a 2023 Fab 50 recruit and he played two years of varsity volleyball at South Elgin High School. He totaled 350 kills and 204 digs in his varsity career, leading his squad to a conference title in 2022.</p>\n                <p>Carter Dittman, OH</p>\n                <p>Entering his third season with the blue and white, Dittman arrives off a productive sophomore season. The Fairport, New York, native tallied 42 kills in 39 sets. His hitting percentage is a key area for improvement, as Dittman committed 21 errors on his 122 total attempts. If he can find the open spots on the court, he will likely become a leader for this squad.</p>\n                <p>Matthew Luoma, OH/OPP</p>\n                <p>Luoma is coming off a strong season in which EIVA gave him a spot on the All-Tournament Team, Academic All-Big Ten and All-EIVA Academic Team. The publication also gave him an honorable mention for the All-EIVA 2025 team. In his redshirt sophomore season, Luoma played in 89 sets, hitting .194 with 294 kills. He also collected 94 digs, 69 blocks, and 21 aces. He reached double-digit kills 15 times and finished the season with seven such matches. If Penn State hopes to compete for an EIVA title, it starts with Luoma leading the front line and being even more productive this season.</p>\n                <p>Blainey Jones OH</p>\n                <p>Named a VolleyballMag.com Fab 50 recruit coming out of high school, Jones hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to make an impact in the blue and white quite yet. Playing in a total of five sets in three seasons thus far, one can expect Jones to have more of an opportunity this season with all the newcomers on the squad.</p>\n                <p>Miller Trubey</p>\n                <p>Like Luoma, Penn State\u2019s frontline relies on Trubey's production. Trubey arrives off a productive year collecting 70 kills, 15 blocks, 31 digs and 12 aces in 65 sets played. As one of the more experienced opposite hitters on the squad, another increase in production from the 7-footer would help the Nittany Lions improve from their record a year ago.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions start their 2026 season with their home-opener against Mount Olive at 6 p.m. Friday.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "\u2018I want to win\u2019 | Mike Rhoades not satisfied with Penn State\u2019s close loss to No. 2 Michigan",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Mike Rhoades walked into the Bryce Jordan Center media room following Penn State\u2019s 74-72 loss to No. 2 Michigan looking defeated.</p>\n                <p>He didn\u2019t seem satisfied that his team, which ranks last in the Big Ten standings, took the Wolverines, who are 14-0 and a national championship contender, down to the wire with a last-second shot missing its mark to lose the game. And he proved that when asked about it.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI want to win. I didn\u2019t come here to do this bullsh\u2014,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI want to win, and I don't care if it's a one-point game or a 30 point game. I mean, I've been coaching long enough we all go through this, but I want to win, and I want these guys to win, and to win, a lot of things go into it. So yeah, I mean, I'm pissed.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions got out to a quick start to Tuesday\u2019s game, securing a 12-6 lead behind 10 early points by 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107. The offense then went cold, and despite shooting 31.4% during the first half, Penn State remained in range of Michigan, which led 40-31 at halftime.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades\u2019 squad battled right out of the gate in the second half, mounting a 6-0 run, but the Wolverines had an answer and grew their lead back out to 53-40. That was a trend throughout much of the half as Michigan led for its entirety.</p>\n                <p>But Penn State made a late push, and it was one the Wolverines barely survived. Behind free throws by forward Josh Reed and wing Eli Rice in addition to a 3-pointer by guard Melih Tunca, the Nittany Lions only trailed 73-72 with 1:04 left after a 7-0 run.</p>\n                <p>Penn State generated a stop on defense, but guard Freddie Dilione V missed a mid-range jumper to take a lead with 16 seconds left. Reed then fouled center Aday Mara, who went 1-of-2 at the stripe to give the Nittany Lions another chance.</p>\n                <p>Coming out of a timeout, Dilione dribbled the ball around halfcourt before attempting an off-balanced 3-pointer that missed, losing the game but having a chance late even without freshman star Kayden Mingo.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur guys showed something today,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI'm sure everybody at Penn State's proud of it, but let's do more. Let's figure it out. Let's keep building on it. We got the youngest team in the league, one of the youngest teams in the country. Our best player goes down. Yeah, we responded the right way. I'm really proud of it, but I want these guys to win.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions begin Big Ten play at 0-4 this season. While there was one blowout loss \u2014 Indiana\u2019s 113-72 win on Dec. 9 \u2014 the other three games have been decided by single digits.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s conference home opener saw it hold a 39-36 lead over No. 9 Michigan State at halftime and even had a 67-64 advantage with 5:00 left in the game. However, the Nittany Lions didn\u2019t score a basket for over four minutes in crunchtime, causing a 76-72 loss.</p>\n                <p>Last Saturday, Penn State hung around Illinois\u2019 lead for much of the second half, but the Fighting Illini never allowed it to get closer than eight points before a 73-65 loss. Rhoades said he isn't into moral victories.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI didn't sign up for this. I don't want to do this,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI'm here, though, and we're going to figure it out. We're going to fight like crazy to do it. So I'm not dejected. I don't get dejected. I hate losing. I freaking hate it, and I don't want us to ever like it or being close is okay, screw that. We didn't come here to be close.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Analyzing what Matt Campbell has accomplished early in Penn State tenure",
    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Matt Campbell and the new staff have been working nonstop since arriving in State College, as they try to build Penn State back into a team that was supposed to compete for a national championship.</p>\n                <p>It may be early in his tenure, but there\u2019s been a handful of things accomplished by the new regime.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s been done so far.</p>\n                <p>Retention</p>\n                <p>Many knew that Campbell would be bringing in his guys from Iowa State to follow him to Happy Valley, but there was uncertainty as to who would stick around from the current Penn State roster.</p>\n                <p>A good chunk of those projected to contribute in 2026 are staying, notably tight end Andrew Rappleyea, starting right guard Anthony Donkoh, linebacker Tony Rojas and defensive end Max Granville.</p>\n                <p>As far as the losses went, notable departures from Penn State were linebacker Amare Campbell, safety King Mack, defensive end Chaz Coleman and defensive tackle Xavier Gilliam.</p>\n                <p>There was bound to be turnover on the coaching staff, as Campbell brought in a large chunk of his Cyclones staff, paired with James Franklin poaching guys to Virginia Tech.</p>\n                <p>A pair of notable keeps were Terry Smith and Dan Connor.</p>\n                <p>Upon the initial reported hiring of Campbell, reports came in that Smith would be sticking around on staff after serving as interim head coach. Campbell had a prior relationship with him when he coached at Toledo and Smith was coaching at Gateway High School. On Monday, the staff directory confirmed he will return to being the associate head coach and cornerbacks coach.`</p>\n                <p>As for Connor, he\u2019ll stick around but is taking a step back from his role. After being promoted from defensive analyst to linebackers coach for the 2025 season, Penn State hired Cincinnati defensive coordinator Tyson Veidt as its next linebackers coach. Connor will be the assistant linebackers coach.</p>\n                <p>Connor could\u2019ve departed to try and become the lead position coach elsewhere, but the former letterman and Penn State\u2019s all-time leader in tackles chose to stick around.</p>\n                <p>Methodical with Cyclones who followed</p>\n                <p>Bringing in quarterback Rocco Becht was the obvious move for Campbell, but Becht\u2019s weapons joined him also. Iowa State\u2019s three leading receivers from 2025, wide receiver Brett Eskildsen, wideout Chase Sowell and tight end Benjamin Brahmer have all pledged to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, starting running back Carson Hansen is on board as well.</p>\n                <p>Defensively, safety Marcus Neal. Jr., defensive back Jamison Patton and a trio of linebackers in Caleb Bacon, Cael Brezina and Kooper Ebel have pledged as well.</p>\n                <p>Now, Brahmer will slide in for Luke Reynolds. Neal will fill in for Mack. The trio of aforementioned linebackers will make up the lost production from Amare Campbell.</p>\n                <p>The other move was on the coaching side, bringing in offensive coordinator/tight ends coach Jake Mouser, quarterbacks coach Jake Water, wide receivers coach Noah Pauley, offensive line coach Ryan Clanton and safeties coach Deon Broomfield.</p>\n                <p>Each position coach received multiple commits from Iowa State per position, giving them familiarity to build on moving forward as they look to develop them.</p>\n                <p>New recruiting terrain</p>\n                <p>During his introductory press conference, Campbell said he's focusing on the 6-8 hour region for recruiting, which likely entails prioritizing Pennsylvania, the northeast and the DMV.</p>\n                <p>This likely will be the case, but he spent 10 years at Iowa State program with a lack of resources and prestige, he had to cast a wide net and hone in on the midwest.</p>\n                <p>Campbell will look to dominate Pennsylvania like Franklin once did, but he\u2019s not letting go of the Iowa pipeline. As part of the transfer class, the Nittany Lions are bringing in seven players who are natives of Iowa.</p>\n                <p>The other state is Nebraska, as Penn State has four committed in their 2026 recruiting class and one as part of the portal group. Of the recruits, four of them are top 10 players in the state.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

He was a graduate of the McDonogh School in Maryland, which has become a Penn State recruiting hotbed in recent years.</p>\n                <p>Sanders will work alongside Notre Dame General Manager Mike Martin, who was promoted to the role in the 2025 season from director of scouting advancement.

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State closed out its non-conference stretch on a low note, as the Nittany Lions suffered their first series sweep at the hands of No. 2 Ohio State. The blue and white return to AHA action with an 18-3 record, and remain in-state for a battle with Mercyhurst in Erie, Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Penn State previously swept the then-No. 15 Lakers on Oct. 17 and Oct. 18, by scores of 3-0 and 6-1, respectively, at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Scouting the Lakers</p>\n                <p>The Lakers return home to the Mercyhurst Ice Center after spending last week in St. Charles, Missouri, in the second half of a four-game series against Lindenwood. On a two-game winning streak, Mercyhurst sits at 13-9-2. Coach Michael Sisti\u2019s squad sits on the cusp of breaking back into the USCHO rankings, recently receiving five votes.</p>\n                <p>The Lakers\u2019 all-around top performer, Julia Perjus, paces the team with 11 goals and 11 assists on the season. She sits second on Mercyhurst in points only behind Julia Schali, whose team-leading 15 assists bolster her total 23 points.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Abby Poitras and freshman Maja Alenius lead the defense with 10 points each, primarily generated by assists. Poitras also paces Mercyhurst with 46 blocked shots, as the first to lay down the body to protect her goaltenders. Right behind her, senior Makayla Javier holds 35 blocks.</p>\n                <p>Set to start between the pipes, Goaltender Magdalena Luggin, makes her 20th start of the season. In her last meeting with the Nittany Lions, she came in relief for freshman Tara Bach in Game 2 of the series. However, the Vienna, Austria, native made 32 saves on 35 shots in Game 1 before originally being given the day off.</p>\n                <p>While Mercyhurst endured an up-and-down season, Luggin's play has been solid in the crease. Despite a 9-8-2 record, the sophomore posted a .923 save percentage and 2.35 goals-against average, including a pair of shutouts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s soon-to-be roster changes</p>\n                <p>Three Nittany Lions will miss collegiate action from Feb. 6 to 22 for the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, and potentially even before, due to their international duty. This factor makes every series leading up to this date potentially their last for Penn State before heading to the Olympics, including this series against the Lakers.</p>\n                <p>Tessa Janecke recently broke Penn State\u2019s program record for career goals when she scored her 75th goal in Game 2 against Ohio State. She will be playing for the U.S Olympic women\u2019s ice hockey team, the first Nittany Lion to do so, against teammates Nicole Hall for Sweden and Matilde Fantin for Italy, both of whom are in line to receive honors to their respective Olympic rosters.</p>\n                <p>Penn State retains much of its offensive and all of its defensive threats despite not being at full strength. Grace Outwater, who wasn\u2019t in the lineup against the Buckeyes, and Maddy Christian lead the blue and white with 13 goals each, while freshman Danica Maynard paces the defense with 20 points.</p>\n                <p>The AHA landscape</p>\n                <p>Penn State and Mercyhurst previously sat atop the AHA for the past three seasons, with the Lakers\u2019 dominance dating back to a record 13 AHA championship titles. However, the Nittany Lions boast more recent success, winning the last three AHA championships with Mercyhurst as the runner-up.</p>\n                <p>In 2022, the year before Penn State\u2019s dynasty began, Mercyhurst fell to Syracuse in the conference championship.</p>\n                <p>This season, the standings sit as wide-open as they\u2019ve ever been. The Nittany Lions lead the conference with an undefeated 12-0 record and 36 points. The Lakers currently rank second with a 9-4-1 record and 26 points.</p>\n                <p>Past the two juggernauts, RIT, Robert Morris, and Syracuse are each in a war to decide who\u2019ll earn the higher seed in the AHA tournament. Lindenwood and Delaware round out the standings at the bottom.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Guard Freddie Dilione V dribbled the ball around halfcourt of Penn State\u2019s final possession against Michigan. The Nittany Lions were down 74-72, and Dilione had a chance to tie or win.</p>\n                <p>Dilione took the ball to the right side of the arc, and his 3-point attempt rattled off the rim as Penn State lost its fourth-straight Big Ten game on Tuesday. The redshirt junior was leading the Nittany Lions\u2019 offense throughout the game as freshman star Kayden Mingo didn\u2019t play.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe last possession, it seemed like they were trying to get (forward Yaxel Lendeborg) off of him, and I thought he did a nice job of switching up and forcing a tough shot,\u201d Michigan coach Dusty May said. \u201cAnd it's tough for Freddie, because he's made a couple threes in that same situation.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dilione finished the game with 17 points, six rebounds and four assists on 6-of-16 shooting from the field and 2-of-6 shooting from 3-point range. While he missed three shots with under two minutes to go, he made back-to-back 3-point attempts earlier in the half to help start Penn State\u2019s comeback.</p>\n                <p>On that final possession, Dilione said the Nittany Lions were looking to get wing Eli Rice, who\u2019s known as a sharpshooter, a shot.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Rice) ended up switching the ball screen,\u201d Dilione said. \u201cAny shot would have been a good shot, just so happens that I ended up missing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dilione was in the starting lineup for the third consecutive game, and he kicked off his night with a layup and two assists as Penn State jumped out to an early 9-4 lead. He finished the first half with six points, but he was battling on the floor elsewhere with five rebounds and three assists.</p>\n                <p>He fought on the defensive end as well, as he had two steals, including one to kick off a run to start the second half. More deep shots fell in for Dilione during the second half, too, hitting 2-of-3 3-pointers.</p>\n                <p>Dilione is a usual double-digit scorer for the Nittany Lions, averaging 14.3 points on 48.2% shooting this season. He was averaging 26.7 minutes per game entering the contest versus the Wolverines.</p>\n                <p>But Dilione was more involved Tuesday night as Mingo, who\u2019s referred to as Penn State\u2019s \u201chead of the snake,\u201d was inactive due to injury.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen a guy goes down, you rally around them the way you help him and help him get on the mend is play really hard. Play hard for him and play hard for each other,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201c(I) thought our guys did that. We told Freddie he's probably gonna play a lot and handle the ball a lot.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dilione did exactly that as he saw 38 minutes throughout Tuesday\u2019s contest. He was a team-high +7 while on the court, and Penn State was -9 in the two minutes he was off the court.</p>\n                <p>Moving forward, Penn State will be without Mingo for \u201ca little bit,\u201d according to Rhoades. Dilione will likely continue to be the Nittany Lions\u2019 starting point guard in Mingo\u2019s absence.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously, we want Kayden out there,\u201d Dilione said. \u201cHe brings a great presence to the game, and he's obviously a great player. Just know him not being out there, next man mentality, just got to go out there, bring it all, and those are pretty close games.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",
