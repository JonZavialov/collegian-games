    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Three decades in Happy Valley, over 900 career games coached, with almost all of the Penn State men\u2019s volleyball program record book written via accolades he\u2019s earned with his teams throughout the way \u2013 Mark Pavlik is a bona fide Penn State legend.</p>\n                <p>Might as well commission his spot on the S. Allen Street mural now.</p>\n                <p>Yet, before the Penn State faithful get to that, the Nittany Lions have a chance to send Pavlik off into retirement with nothing but pride in the rearview mirror, but on that conquest, they have staggered to an even 4-4 start.</p>\n                <p>However, Pavlik and Co. get a look at an excellent opportunity to turn around that start and faltering form when it welcomes one of the bosses\u2019 most familiar foes throughout his tenure \u2013 Saint Francis, led by its winningest coach of all time and of several decades, Mike Rumbaugh.</p>\n                <p>The Red Flash and the Nittany Lions met over 50 times in their program\u2019s history, almost all of which during Pavlik\u2019s and Rumbuagh\u2019s tenures, and the results lean almost entirely in the blue and white\u2019s favor, 54-3 all-time.</p>\n                <p>While there's familiarity in the matchup with success for Pavlik, and that\u2019s precisely how the 2026 edition went, with the Nittany Lions cruising to a three set sweep. There\u2019s also a new shakeup in the matchup \u2013 it\u2019s the first time Rumbuagh\u2019s squad stepped into Rec Hall at the DIII Level and as a member of its new league, the NEC.</p>\n                <p>For this unique version of a clash of familiar foes, Pavlik sent out his own group of usuals, with typical starters Jaxon Herr, Ryan Merk, Jaidyn Bethel, Gaige Gabriel, Sean Harvey, Owen Rose and Matthew Luoma to complete the first unit.</p>\n                <p>That group battled back and forth with the Red Flash as the two traded kills and minimal errors to a 6-6 first set.</p>\n                <p>Penn State then pulled ahead via an eight-point scoring streak, highlighted by a Bethel ace. The rest of the set resembled the start, as the two units traded kills and service errors to a 25-20 Penn State advantage \u2013 the closest the first frame finished since a 2023 extra points first set.</p>\n                <p>The second frame looked to contain more optimism for the Nittany Lions, as a pair of kills and a Red Flash attack error via a Harvey block got the blue and white out to an early 3-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>However, that fine lead was all Penn State maintained throughout the second set, as the Nittany Lions exchanged blows throughout its duration. The blue and white logged a second ace of the match to pull ahead 14-13, this time courtesy of Gabriel, and it boosted their momentum.</p>\n                <p>Harvey notched a kill, Saint Francis blundered two of its attacks and Tristan Hassell put up a big block to pull the blue and white 22-16.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offense stayed hot, as Hassell logged a kill to put the Nittany Lions at set point, and then, after a group of Pavlik substitutions, they finished the job. Herr launched a serve over the net, and when the ball came back, the Nittany Lions struck on the opportunity, as the senior assisted Harvey on the set-clinching kill.</p>\n                <p>Entering the third set, Saint Francis\u2019s Brady Stump logged a match-high eight kills, but also posted five errors, while Penn State had a much more team attack, as four logged three or more kills. Harvey led the blue and white with four errors and five kills \u2013 tied with Luoma.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started the third set with another Harvey kill, and then Herr joined in on the fun, as he logged a pair of kills, a pair of assists and an assist on a Gabriel block, which boosted the blue and white to an 8-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>Saint Francis clawed back with a triad of kills, but Penn State still became the first to reach double-digits, as it drew closer to a sweep with a 14-7 lead.</p>\n                <p>Saint Francis cut the deficit to six as the Nittany Lions approached 20 points, and a pair of Bethel kills extended the Nittany Lions' lead closer to victory.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, the blue and white used its momentum to take down the Red Flash, despite a four-point stretch in which they narrowed the lead to 23-18 and forced Pavlik to call a timeout.</p>\n                <p>Bethel made it match point after the break, and a Luoma kill eventually sealed the deal.</p>\n                <p>Harvey finished with a team-high nine kills and a team-high 11 points, while Herr finished with a game-high 21 assists.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The blue and white continue its series against Saint Francis, this time on the opposition\u2019s turf, as it stays in the Commonwealth with a trip to Loretto to face the Red Flash at DeGol Arena.</p>\n                <p>Streaming is available at 6 p.m. on NEC Front Row.</p>",

    "description": "<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Penn State showed up and showed out in Crisler Arena. The Nittany Lions continued their dominance with a 38-3 win against Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got five tech falls, and seemed to be in control for many of the matches. Nate Desmond and PJ Duke had comeback wins after being down in both of their matches, but both were able to prevail.</p>\n                <p>125 Pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs No. 26 Diego Sotelo (MICH)</p>\n                <p>After a bit of hand fighting back-and-forth, Luke Lilledahl was the first to get a takedown. When Diego Sotelo attempted to get up, the sophomore slammed him back down on the mat. Sotelo eventually got up, but was taken down twice more to take a 9-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl started in neutral and took down Sotelo immediately. Sotelo started to show some life when he secured a reversal, but it was answered by Lilledahl\u2019s sixth takedown of the match.</p>\n                <p>The match ended with a Lilledahl reversal to win 21-5 by tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 5-0.</p>\n                <p>133 Pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs Gauge Botero (MICH)</p>\n                <p>After a slow start to the match, Marcus Blaze got things started with a takedown. The freshman got over a minute of riding time, another takedown and four near-fall points to end the period up 10-1.</p>\n                <p>Gauge Botero was able to get Blaze to under a minute of riding time, but the Perrysburg, Ohio, native escaped and then secured his third takedown of the match. Blaze let Botero up and then took him down immediately to get a 17-2 tech fall victory late in the second period.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 10-0.</p>\n                <p>141 Pounds: Nate Desmond (PSU) vs No. 26 Dylan Ragusin (NU)</p>\n                <p>Nate Desmond got the call and was close to securing a takedown in the first period, but Dylan Ragusin didn\u2019t let it happen and guarded it well. The first period was notched up at 0-0.</p>\n                <p>Ragusin escaped from Desmond early and continued to show strong defense until Desmond got a hold of his leg and got the takedown. Ragusin got awarded a stall point and the reversal and took a 4-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>Desmond was on another level in the third period with a reversal after slamming Regusin on the mat. Ragusin was able to escape to tie the match at five.</p>\n                <p>Desmond got the takedown in sudden victory to get the 8-5 as he wrapped around Ragusin and threw him down on the mat. Penn State leads 13-0.</p>\n                <p>149: Pounds: No. 4 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs No. 13 Lachlan McNeil (MICH)</p>\n                <p>These two last wrestled at the NCAA championships, with the outcome being in Shayne Van Ness\u2019s favor. After the first period, neither wrestler was able to find the score sheet.</p>\n                <p>Lachlan McNeil escaped first and gave Van Ness a point for illegal touch to the back of the head. The junior then got the takedown and was on top of McNeil for the rest of the period.</p>\n                <p>McNeil got two stalling calls, which awarded Van Ness a point and the junior built off that with a takedown to take an 8-1 lead. With the riding time, Van Ness gets the major decision victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 17-0.</p>\n                <p>157 Pounds: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs No. 13 Cameron Catrabone (MICH)</p>\n                <p>Cameron Catrabone got the action started with an early takedown, but Duke escaped. After a stoppage for potential injury, Duke was on top and Catrabone got his fourth point of the period. Catrabone ended the period on top 4-1.</p>\n                <p>Catrabone got the escape to start the second, but Duke started to get aggressive and took Catrabone down soon after. The freshman continued to lead the charge and took a 7-6 lead going into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Catrabone got the takedown and Duke immediately escaped, got a takedown of his own to take an 11-9 lead. Catrabone escaped and with riding time, Duke got the victory 12-10.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 20-0.</p>\n                <p>165 Pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs Justin Gates (MICH)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink started with a takedown in the opening 30 seconds and another one a minute later to take a 6-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>To start the middle frame, Mesenbrink got a reversal and continued to be on top of Justin Gates, who eventually escaped, and then got taken down by the junior. Mesenbrink got his fourth takedown to take a 14-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>The third frame started in neutral and Mesenbrink took Gates down twice and got the 20-5 tech fall victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 25-0.</p>\n                <p>174 Pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs No. 11 Beau Mantanona (MICH)</p>\n                <p>A lot of back-and-forth action between Levi Haines and Beau Mantanona, with Haines getting the takedown after Mantanona almost had his leg for a takedown. The senior continued to control the match and led 6-1.</p>\n                <p>Haines continued to be on top in the second with another takedown and over two minutes of riding time.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions continued to take a neutral starting position. Haines secured three more takedowns to get the 19-4 tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 30-0.</p>\n                <p>184 Pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs No. 7 Brock Mantanona (MICH)</p>\n                <p>The match started with hand fighting between the two until Rocco Welsh grabbed Brock Mantanona\u2019s leg and got him down on the mat to score the first points of the match.</p>\n                <p>Welsh escaped to extend his lead to 4-0. The sophomore also added over a minute of riding time.</p>\n                <p>Mantanona got his first escape of the match to lessen the lead to 4-1, but with the riding time, and a late takedown, Welsh got the victory, 8-1.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 33-0.</p>\n                <p>197 Pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs No. 20 Hayden Walters (MICH)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr scored the only points of the first period with a takedown on Hayden Walters. Barr added a second takedown in the second period. Walters was called for his first stalling call of the match, and Barr added his third takedown to take a 9-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Barr added another takedown and got a stalling point due to Walters being inactive. The sophomore continued to score more takedowns with another one with 35 seconds left in the final frame.</p>\n                <p>Barr gets his sixth takedown of the match and the tech fall victory 19-4, extending Penn State\u2019s lead 38-0.</p>\n                <p>285 Pounds: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs No. 5 Taye Ghadiali (MICH)</p>\n                <p>It was a stalemate between the two heavyweights and Cole Mirasola had a chance to secure points, but was unable to get Taye Ghadiali on the ground, something we\u2019ve seen earlier this season.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola started on the bottom and struggled to get up as Ghadali tossed and turned Mirasola all over the mat. Mirasola eventually escaped and almost got another takedown, but it was Ghadali who got the takedown and the lead 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Ghadali escaped, and Mirasola continued to make attempts to take Ghadali down, but couldn\u2019t get the job done. It looked like, at the end, that Mirasola could\u2019ve been awarded a takedown, but it wasn\u2019t called.</p>\n                <p>Penn State gets the win 38-3.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>While the snow fell in State College, No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey avoided the poor Pennsylvania weather with a trip to Missouri for the final road series of the 2025-26 regular season against the Lindenwood Lions.</p>\n                <p>In an eventful five-goal first period, Danica Maynard recorded four points and was one of four different goal scorers in what was a 6-3 win over the Lions in Penn State\u2019s 20th conference win of the season, a new AHA record</p>\n                <p>The freshman defenseman now has 30 points this season, and it is her second four-point performance she has recorded this season</p>\n                <p>Perhaps the blue and white dealt with some jet lag following their flight to Missouri, as they allowed a goal just 2:23 into the game. Just the eighth time Penn State has allowed its opponent to score first and has done so in back-to-back games.</p>\n                <p>Lindenwood\u2019s Zsofia Pazmandi performed a toe drag to evade defenseman Grace Tullock and got a shot off. Katie DeSa made the initial save, but Pazmandi jumped on her own rebound to put the Lions up early.</p>\n                <p>That goal sparked something in the Nittany Lions' offense.</p>\n                <p>Only 28 seconds after going down 1-0, Maynard picked up the puck at her own blue line and skated up the far side boards in front of the benches, split two Lions skaters, and fired a shot off of Lindenwood goaltender Lexington Secreto. Grace Outwater put the rebound in on a wide-open net to knot the game at one.</p>\n                <p>Outwater has scored in each of her last eight games with 11 total points in that stretch.</p>\n                <p>From there, Penn State\u2019s offense continued to spearhead its attack down Lindenwood\u2019s throat and added three more goals to score four unanswered goals within the first ten minutes of action.</p>\n                <p>Maynard would soon be awarded for her efforts on Penn State\u2019s first goal after Pazmandi was assessed a two-minute minor penalty for interference.</p>\n                <p>After a successful clear from Lindenwood, the Nittany Lions drove their way back into their offensive zone. After a few give-and-gos with Kendall Butze, Maynard crept in from the blue line to the top of the slot and sent the puck pass from Katelyn Roberts through traffic to put the blue and white up 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Roberts continued the trend set by Maynard of assisting on one goal and scoring on the next. After a two-minute scoring break, Roberts caught a pass the length of half the ice from Butze and fed a centering pass to Mya Vaslet, who was brought down on a trip.</p>\n                <p>No power play needed for the senior winger as she picked up the puck after Secreto\u2019s save, transferred to her backhand and slid the puck past the goal line to put Penn State up 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Following a faceoff in the defensive zone, Maynard showed off her speed the entire length of the ice and delivered a cross-crease pass to Maddy Christian, which capped off the Penn State scoring in the opening period.</p>\n                <p>After allowing four goals on seven shots, coach Taylor Wasylk pulled Secreto for Madison Bowtell.</p>\n                <p>Showing no discouragement of a 4-1 deficit, Lindenwood\u2019s offense challenged DeSa and the Penn State defense early in the second period, including a 2-on-1 only 30 seconds in.</p>\n                <p>Despite a challenging first period, the blue and white continued their scoring spree in the second period, just a minute after Lindenwood\u2019s scoring opportunity.</p>\n                <p>Abby Stonehouse blocked a shot with her skate and deflected the puck into the Nittany Lions\u2019 offensive zone. Stonehouse and Robert\u2019s combined presence forced Lindenwood to keep the puck in its own defensive zone. Taylor Lum deked around a skater and delivered a pass to McKenna Walsh, who easily tapped it between the legs of Bowtell.</p>\n                <p>Just over six minutes into the second period, the black and gold finally found the reward they were searching for.</p>\n                <p>After forcing a turnover at the blue line on a poke check against Stonehouse, Paige Cline cut to the net on a 2-on-1 with Molly Henderson. Henderson set a screen on Butze, allowing Cline to put one past the blocker of DeSa and cut the deficit to 5-2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State nearly answered just moments after, but the sophomore goaltender Bowtell made an impressive save to prevent the Nittany Lions from flipping the momentum.</p>\n                <p>Lum continued to play with a crash-the-net style with passes to the crease. Lum created another scoring opportunity with this style, which led to Shelby Shane scoring her first collegiate goal, the sixth of the evening for Penn State</p>\n                <p>Despite trailing 6-2, Lindenwood continued to play as though it were ahead. While skating at 4-on-4, Tatiana Blichova sent a pass off the glass to Henderson, who dragged the puck around Tullock for a shot on goal. DeSa lost the puck behind her, and it was poked in by Josey Dunne-Weeks to cut the Penn State lead in half.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions continued to dominate, but it was Bowtell who dominated in the crease. The 5-foot-5-inch netminder stopped all 11 shots she faced in the third period and made 29 saves on 31 shots in the loss.</p>\n                <p>Bowtell stood tall on multiple 2-on-1 cross-crease opportunities, and capped off her third-period performance with a highlight-reel worthy save on a breakaway from Outwater.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions improved to 27-4 and will play in their final road match of the regular season at 2 p.m. on Saturday against Lindenwood.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Coming off a thrilling 7-4 extra innings win over Missouri in its season opener, Penn State faced Boston College in the second game of its doubleheader on Friday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions displayed pitching excellence and carried their offensive momentum into this game, picking up the shutout win over the Eagles, 7-0.</p>\n                <p>After junior Bridget Nemeth closed the door and picked up the win in the blue and white\u2019s last game, coach Clarisa Crowell gave her the start against the Eagles. While senior Halie Pappion got the task to face the Nittany Lions\u2019 lineup after they started rolling late against Missouri.</p>\n                <p>It didn\u2019t take long for Penn State to strike on offense as the blue and white carried its momentum right into this game early in the first. Junior Michela Barbanente reached base on a one-out walk and then swiped second base for her first steal of the campaign. With a runner already in scoring position, junior star Brooke Klosowicz picked up right where she left off last season.</p>\n                <p>The slugger powered a two-run home run deep over the left field fence, giving the Nittany Lions an early 2-0 lead. While Penn State threatened again with a few runners later in the inning, Pappion minimized the damage and allowed no more runs.</p>\n                <p>The hot bats continued in the second, pressuring Pappion into escaping another jam. Senior Madison Seidel led off with a triple dropped into right center and freshman Breanna Hanik followed with a walk.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions stayed aggressive on the base paths early, as Hanik swiped second base and set Penn State up with runners on second and third. However, Pappion settled and got out the next three blue and white batters, which prevented any runs.</p>\n                <p>Despite a productive first few innings for the blue and white, the bats settled down. Yet, Nemeth was plowing through the Eagles\u2019 lineup and allowed no runs. The Glendora, California, native threw a dominant three scoreless innings, surrendering just one hit and one walk.</p>\n                <p>Since Nemeth already pitched 2.1 innings in the earlier doubleheader game, Crowell turned to her bullpen at the start of the fourth and brought in freshman Mackenzie Duncan. The Winter Garden, Florida, native ran into some trouble when Boston College had a runner in scoring position, but Meghan Schouten flew out to right fielder Cara Bohner for the third out.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State\u2019s bats went cold for three innings, they came alive again in the fifth. Needing some offensive momentum, freshman Kirsten Finarelli delivered her first collegiate dinger into right and gave the Nittany Lions another insurance run, 3-0.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Natalie Lieto followed with a walk, which brought in sophomore Bailey Kendziorski, who ended Pappion\u2019s outing. Despite freshman Allison Oneacre walking, Bohner grounded into a fielder\u2019s choice and Oneacre was out at second.</p>\n                <p>Duncan mowed down the Eagles\u2019 batters in the bottom half of the fifth. The left-handed pitcher struck out all three players she faced and preserved the three-run lead going into the later innings.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s bats carried the momentum from the last inning into the sixth. Hannik reached base on a five-pitch walk, and junior Kaylie Walters followed with a single. The blue and white were relentless on the base paths as Hannik stole third and then scored off an error by the Eagles\u2019 shortstop Janis Espinoza.</p>\n                <p>Despite not scoring any more runs in the inning, the Nittany Lions took a 4-0 lead late. After another shutdown inning by Duncan, Penn State pulled away in the seventh.</p>\n                <p>Boston College\u2019s first baseman Emma Knight surrendered the Eagles' third error of the game, allowing a leadoff runner. Lieto then smashed a double into deep center field, but Finarelli didn\u2019t score until Oneacre knocked in both runs on a single, making it 6-0. She also made it to second off another fielding miscue by Boston College.</p>\n                <p>A few batters later, Seidel knocked Oneacre in from third on a groundout to second, and Penn State took a commanding 7-0 lead into the bottom of the seventh. Duncan delivered an impressive collegiate debut, throwing 4 scoreless innings in relief, allowing just 2 hits and striking out 6.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State continues its road trip in Clearwater, Florida, and faces Eastern Kentucky in its first game of Saturday\u2019s doubleheader at noon.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Taylor Mouser has been at Penn State for two months as the new offensive coordinator, and in that timespan, he slammed a Bud Light at both Beaver Stadium and Pegula Ice Arena for men\u2019s hockey games.</p>\n                <p>But he does more than crush cans of beer. He\u2019s been Matt Campbell\u2019s right-hand man at Iowa State, becoming \u201cone of the up-and-coming bright minds in college football\u201d as explained by Campbell.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve watched him mature in terms of who he\u2019s become as a play-caller, a great leader of people,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWhen you put the coordinator title to any of these coaches, I think you\u2019re expecting a gentleman and somebody that\u2019s got unbelievable leadership ability and the ability to align and unify a group, and Taylor\u2019s done a great job of that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mouser spent all 10 seasons with Campbell at Iowa State, and took on titles of graduate assistant, assistant director of scouting, senior quality control on offense and tight ends coach before becoming the offensive coordinator the past two seasons.</p>\n                <p>He additionally spent one year with Campbell when he was the head coach at Toledo as a graduate assistant.</p>\n                <p>So when Campbell left for Penn State and presented Mouser with an opportunity to be the offensive coordinator and tight ends coach for the Nittany Lions, Mouser said it \u201cwasn\u2019t a hard decision at all.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After all, when Mouser finished his time playing defensive line for Division II Adams State in Colorado, he was working at Little Caesars trying to get into the coaching world and Campbell was the only one who picked up his calls.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only person that hit me back,\u201d Mouser said. \u201cI don\u2019t forget that, and the loyalty that he\u2019s given me to be able to promote me to a spot where I got to be the offensive coordinator for the last couple years at Iowa State, and have success. So, it didn\u2019t necessarily matter. It was Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In his short time in State College, Mouser has been impressed by the tradition in the program but also the support from the fanbase. He loved his time going to the men\u2019s hockey games, saying he typically doesn\u2019t get to be a fan, though offensive line coach Ryan Clanton referred to Mouser as the \u201cbiggest hockey fan\u201d in Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s been a culture shift for Mouser, and while there\u2019s adjusting to do off the field, there\u2019s also changes on the field.</p>\n                <p>Mouser made it clear that what worked for the Cyclones might not fly for the Nittany Lions and yet, the belief in those around him show that the 2025 Football Scoop Tight Ends Coach of the Year has what it takes to succeed as a play caller no matter where he is.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's a special dude. He can wear every hat,\u201d quarterbacks coach Jake Waters said. \u201cHe's extremely smart, football wise, extremely competitive. Wants to be the best and then he cares about relationships a lot.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Building relationships is part of the identity that Mouser has created. Clanton said \u201cif you believe in something, he believes in it.\u201d Waters said he\u2019s never met someone who met Mouser and said they didn\u2019t like him.</p>\n                <p>Coming off of a 2025 season where ex-offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki and his play calling left much to be desired, he brings a fresh face to the role with high expectations.</p>\n                <p>Mouser believes in himself, as do many others in his circle, and is ready to put in the work to represent Penn State and what it took for him to get to this point.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis place is incredible, and it\u2019s a school that you dream about when you\u2019re a small school guy. I played at a Division II,\u201d Mouser said. \u201cAs a kid, you watch Penn State football games and the history here. You know about it. Even the idea of coming and coaching at a place like this, it\u2019s so far-fetched. It doesn\u2019t even enter your mind when you know where I was at before.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>As the spring lingers in Happy Valley, the Nittany Lions have a look at creating a productive season. Ending their 2025 campaign 33-23, their final game against Nebraska resulted in a 6-3 loss.</p>\n                <p>Looking to bounce back in the 2026 season, the blue and white hope to reach the postseason once again.</p>\n                <p>After not being able to secure the Big Ten championship, Penn State looks to exceed expectations this season.</p>\n                <p>For the topic of the postseason to even be brought up, it's important to know how well the Nittany Lions perform in the regular season.</p>\n                <p>Facing off in Big Ten play is what's most important to monitor. The Nittany Lions can compete with any of their conference rivals; the style of play and the depth of the bullpen are the pivotal keys for the squad.</p>\n                <p>Regular season stakes</p>\n                <p>A month into baseball season, the Nittany Lions will face off against the Hawkeyes for a three-game home series. This weekend will be the first look into how Penn State can play within the conference.</p>\n                <p>In early April, Penn State takes a trip to Haymarket Park in Lincoln to face off against Nebraska for a three-game weekend series.</p>\n                <p>The Washington Huskies visit State College in May for a Big Ten weekend.</p>\n                <p>How the Nittany Lions perform in their three-game series is a major determinant for how the squad will progress in the postseason.</p>\n                <p>When the stakes are high, as history has shown, conference play can be tricky. Maryland and Nebraska are the toughest postseason matchups the blue and white can face.</p>\n                <p>NCAA regional play</p>\n                <p>Beyond the Big Ten, Penn State\u2019s challenges rise in the NCAA regional bracket.</p>\n                <p>The biggest problems stem from the power-hungry programs in the ACC and SEC. Dominating the College World Series, the last time a Big Ten school won was back in 1966, when the Ohio State Buckeyes won it all.</p>\n                <p>In 2019, Michigan reached the final but didn\u2019t win the hardware.</p>\n                <p>Teams in the south thrive on extra base hits and home runs, so one poor pitch from the Nittany Lion bullpen can change the game within seconds.</p>\n                <p>No matter the opposition, the blue and white go up against their postseason fate on the execution of pitching, a very clean defense, and scoring early runs.</p>\n                <p>While there are many months before the Nittany Lions face the playoffs, how the regular season unfolds is a focal point.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Following an 18-14 victory over Colgate in Holuba Hall last weekend, the Nittany Lions will be back indoors for a matchup with Villanova on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s win against the Raiders was fueled by offensive production that was relatively evenly distributed, with nine different Nittany Lions finding the back of Colgate\u2019s net.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore attackman Hunter Aquino recorded a team-high six points in the victory, four of which were goals. Aquino was one of three Penn State players to record a hat trick, joining fellow attackman Kyle Lehman and midfielder Michael Faraone.</p>\n                <p>Aquino\u2019s points came on a team-high 14 shots, a mark only Lehman came close to matching with nine. The attack unit of Aquino, Lehman, and freshman Jack Iannantuono combined for 14 points and eight goals in the win over Colgate.</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s game will be the season opener for the Wildcats. They also opened their season against Penn State last year, where the Nittany Lions secured a 15-5 victory in Villanova, Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Villanova went 8-7 last season, with a 4-1 record in conference play. That campaign ended in the second round of the Big East Tournament, when they were eliminated by Georgetown.</p>\n                <p>The Wildcats placed second in the season-opening Big East coaches\u2019 poll, receiving the only first-place vote not given to No. 5 Georgetown. They also received votes in the preseason Inside Lacrosse rankings, though they were unable to crack the top-20.</p>\n                <p>The team\u2019s biggest weapon offensively will be Colin Michener, who was tied for the team lead with 40 points last season. The 6-foot-3 senior scored 26 goals in 2025, a mark that ranked second on the team, and his 14 assists were the most by any Wildcat.</p>\n                <p>Michener, a senior out of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, is a two-time All-Big East second team honoree and has scored 63 goals for the Wildcats through just two seasons on the field.</p>\n                <p>Jake Melchionni, a junior LSM for Villanova, received two preseason awards, being named a third-team All-American by Nike Lacrosse and getting a second-team nod by USILA. Fellow pole Jack Shoemaker was also honored as a USA Lacrosse preseason All-American honorable mention.</p>\n                <p>The trio of Michener, Melchionni and Shoemaker were each named to the preseason All-Big East team, all being unanimous selections.</p>\n                <p>Penn State holds a 21-9 all-time record against the Wildcats and has faced them in all but one season since 2008. The Nittany Lions currently hold a two-game winning streak over Villanova, following a two-game losing streak in 2022 and 2023.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State traveled to Clearwater, Florida, for its season opener against Missouri on Friday morning. The matchup was the first game of the Nittany Lions\u2019 doubleheader as the blue and white looked to start its campaign off strong with a solid win over a nonconference opponent.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions pulled off an impressive season opener win in extra innings, with clutch pitching and timely offense, 7-4.</p>\n                <p>While coach Clarisa Crowell started junior McKenna Young on the bump, Missouri gave the ball to senior Cierra Harrison. Both right-handed pitchers started the game off strong with two strikeouts each in the first.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions put pressure on Harrison in the second with a couple of base hits by Natalie Lieto and Cara Bohner, but they were both stranded after Madison Seidel struck out for the third out. After being held scoreless in the top half, the Tigers cracked through in their half of the second.</p>\n                <p>Young walked Madison Uptegrove on four pitches with one out, and then Abby Hay reached on an error by Bohner in right field. Kayley Lenger loaded the bases with a shallow single to center, which led to a sacrifice fly that plated the opening run, 1-0. In her first jam of the season, Young minimized the damage and forced a groundout from the next batter.</p>\n                <p>Missouri took the early lead, but it didn\u2019t last long as Penn State would quickly respond with some runs of its own in the next inning. The top of the lineup delivered the offensive punch, beginning with a Kaylie Walters walk. With just one out, Michela Barbanente knocked in Walters on a hard-hit ball to the right-center gap.</p>\n                <p>Barbanente sped around the bases and reached third for an RBI triple and set up star Brooke Klosowicz for an opportunity to give Penn State its first lead of the season. The Johnsburg, Illinois, native delivered with a single into right field and put the Nittany Lions up 2-1.</p>\n                <p>However, the Tigers quickly evened the score back up in the bottom half. Young struggled with control and walked three Missouri batters, which led to a bases-loaded jam with two outs. The Brodhead, South Dakota, native couldn\u2019t find the strike zone and walked in a run. With the game tied at two, Crowell brought in Abigail Britton, and she stopped the bleeding with a groundout.</p>\n                <p>While the fourth began promising after Bohner ripped a triple to left field, Harrison stayed composed and struck out the next three Penn State batters looking to prevent Bohner from scoring.</p>\n                <p>After Britton delivered a shutdown inning, the blue and white broke through on offense in the fifth. Harrison was on a roll and retired five straight Nittany Lions until freshman Kirsten Finarelli lined a two-out single up the middle. In one of the biggest at-bats of the day, Lieto doubled to right field and plated Finarelli, giving Penn State a 3-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Britton retired the first five Missouri batters she faced until she lost control and hit Emma Jackson with one out. The sophomore then walked pinch-hitter Saniya Hill, prompting Crowell to bring in freshman Brevyn Kellepouris.</p>\n                <p>The left-handed pitcher surrendered an RBI single by Uptegrove, which tied the game again, 3-3. However, with runners on first and third, the Olathe, Kansas, native kept her composure and struck out the next two Missouri batters swinging, keeping the game knotted.</p>\n                <p>Penn State went down quietly in its half of the sixth, but Kellepouris found herself in a jam later in the inning. Sophie Smith smashed a leadoff double down the right field line and a sacrifice bunt quickly advanced her to third. Yet, Kellepouris escaped the scoring threat by retiring the next two batters on a lineout and groundout.</p>\n                <p>Pressure mounted as the game headed to the seventh, still tied, and neither squad produced much offense in the inning, so the tight contest headed to extra innings.</p>\n                <p>Finarelli began the eighth on second as the blue and white\u2019s ghost runner and she quickly moved to third off a sacrifice bunt by Lieto. Freshman Allison Oneacre plated Finarelli with a short sacrifice fly and the Nittany Lions took a 4-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>Kellepouris stayed in the game and faced the bottom half of the Tigers' lineup. While she got the first out off catcher\u2019s interference, Kayley Lenger knocked a single up the middle and plated the tying run, 4-4. Lenger also advanced to second base off the throw to home, so Missouri quickly had Penn State on its heels.</p>\n                <p>The freshman struck out Smith for the second out, but walked the next two batters for a two-out bases-loaded situation with the season opener on the line. Crowell called upon junior Bridget Nemeth to extend the game. The Glendora, California, native forced a groundout to second baseman Barbanente, who flipped it to shortstop Walters for the crucial third out.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white came away empty in its half of the ninth, so Nemeth needed a scoreless inning of her own. After a successful sacrifice bunt to first base, the Tigers had a runner on third and a chance to end the game. Yet, Nemeth rose to the occasion and retired the next two Tigers, forcing a tenth inning.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offense finally broke Missouri reliever Courney Donahue after just one run in four innings. With one out and Barbanente on third, Finarelli slipped a single to shallow right field and plated the go-ahead run, 5-4. The Lehman, Pennsylvania, native also advanced to second on the hit due to a fielding miscue by right fielder Claire Cahalan.</p>\n                <p>The scoring didn\u2019t stop there as Oneacre smashed her first collegiate home run to deep left field and added massive insurance runs, extending the lead 7-4. Now in a prime position to win the season opener, Nemeth retired the Tigers in order and secured the nonconference victory for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State plays the second game of its doubleheader against Boston College at 1 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>As the month of February begins, the Nittany Lions softball season awakens. Penn State softball kicks off its season playing in the beautiful Sunshine State. The NFCA Leadoff Classic will be held in Clearwater, Florida, from Feb. 6-8.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white will face five opponents this upcoming weekend. After a record-breaking 2025 season, Penn State has a chance to follow up with another successful season. To start the weekend, the Nittany Lions will play a doubleheader on Friday against Missouri and Boston College.</p>\n                <p>Continuing the weekend with yet another double header on Saturday, going up against Eastern Kentucky and BYU.</p>\n                <p>Eastern Kentucky</p>\n                <p>The first pitch of the day will be at Noon, Saturday. Where the Nittany Lions will face off against Eastern Kentucky for their third game of the NFCA Leadoff Classic.</p>\n                <p>Eastern Kentucky was the No.1 team in the ASUN conference last season. Going 17-5 within their conference and 38-16 in their 2025 run. Chasing another successful season after coming off a Gold Division championship season.</p>\n                <p>The ASUN Preseason coaches poll placed the Colones at the No.2 spot.

Scoring 52 times and driving in 45 runs, the Perland, Texas native hit the second- highest total in the ASUN.</p>\n                <p>The Colonels\u2019 rising star, sophomore Jada Mcleod will be a leading factor in the afternoon matchup. McLeod, an infielder, was an ASUN All-Freshman team and a Third Team All-ASUN honoree.</p>\n                <p>Bringing in five home runs, seven doubles, one triple, 27 RBI\u2019s, and 35 hits in her inaugural season as a Colonel.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions prepare to face off against a dominating ASUN conference team.

Finishing No.16 nationally with a total of 80 homers, No.23 in double plays per game and No.23 in slugging percentage.</p>\n                <p>Ranked No.11 on D1 Softball\u2019s preseason outfielder ranking, Brittingham is also No.14 for utility player ranking by Softball America, and No.49 on D1 Softball D100 preseason player rankings.

A 17-4 victory for the Nittany Lions in five innings.</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s matchups for the blue and white will be a must-watch.

    "title": "Looking at Penn State basketball\u2019s Justin Houser\u2019s development as he sees more minutes due to injuries",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State originally planned for freshman Justin Houser to potentially redshirt this season while giving center Yanic Konan Niederhauser a 7-footer he could play against in practice.</p>\n                <p>Instead, with Konan Niederhauser leaving for the NBA this past offseason, Houser is on a different development path as he\u2019s a depth piece. Big men Ivan Juri\u0107, Tibor Mirti\u010d and Sa\u0161a Ciani have all missed the last two games due to injuries, so Houser\u2019s seen an uptick in playing time, including a career high in minutes during Penn State\u2019s 110-69 loss to Michigan on Thursday night.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's the biggest guy on the team when Ivan is not there, so he's got to play, and it's great for him as a freshman to play 21 minutes in a Big Ten game against the No. 2 team in the country,\u201d Mike Rhoades said postgame. \u201cIt makes you realize where you're at, how much work you have ahead of you, and you got to build on it. He battled. He was nervous early, and then I thought he battled as he went on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Houser hasn\u2019t started either game as the Nittany Lions opted for a small-ball lineup with forward Josh Reed at the five to begin both matchups, but he\u2019s come in off the bench early. The 7-footer subbed in at the 16:47 mark of the first half in Thursday\u2019s game.</p>\n                <p>The Phelps School product was up against a tough Michigan frontcourt with players like 7-foot-3 center Aday Mara. Houser ended his night with six points, two rebounds and two blocks on 2-of-5 shooting, and he picked up four fouls as well.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades has said previously that the speed of a game catches up to Houser at times, and he reiterated during Tuesday\u2019s press conference that Houser has to get bigger. Houser\u2019s listed weight is 235 pounds, and Rhoades said the goal is 250 pounds.</p>\n                <p>While Rhoades outlined the work Houser still needs to do, he gave some praise to the young 7-footer, too. During his limited playing time this season, him giving full effort is apparent.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEspecially since Christmas time, I think he's just really improved, and some things are becoming clearer for him,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cHe loves basketball. He loves being here at Penn State. When you're a big guy like him, freshman bigs don't understand how physical the Big Ten is until they get hit a couple times.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Houser has seen at least five minutes of playing time in three games this season. Last Sunday, he chipped in three rebounds, two points and a block while only recording one foul in eight minutes during Penn State\u2019s 77-75 win over Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Earlier this season, Houser played 13 minutes against Pitt on Dec. 21, and while it was an 80-46 loss for the Nittany Lions, he helped provide a spark to begin a comeback attempt before it fell apart. Houser totaled five points and a block with four fouls versus the Panthers.</p>\n                <p>Throughout his first year in Happy Valley, Houser gets to work with assistant coach Brent Scott, who developed Konan Niederhauser into a first-round NBA draft pick. Houser said his defense has taken the \u201cbiggest jump,\u201d saying he thinks he\u2019s improved tenfold.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's been great working with coach Scott,\u201d Houser said Tuesday. \u201cI mean, he's helped me a lot after practice. I\u2019m watching film with him. He's working me out. He's helping me improve my skills a lot, which has been awesome.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Houser is a raw talent who isn\u2019t expected to see much playing time when the depth chart is fully healthy. Juri\u0107, who was listed as \u201cquestionable,\u201d still has uncertain availability with Rhoades saying he hopes to have Juri\u0107 back for the upcoming USC game on Sunday, while Ciani and Mirti\u010d have yet to shake off the \u201cout\u201d tag on the availability report.</p>\n                <p>In other words, Houser could still be tasked with a sizable role in the rotation against the Trojans. It\u2019s a different reality from developing under Konan Niederhauser, but Rhoades has one main message to Houser.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI just tell him to go out there and play harder than the guy you're going against,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cLet's just start with that. I say that to him all the time. Outrun him, outplay him, be more physical than him, and if you get lost in that, then you're not overthinking the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Julia Frederick | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s 11:15 a.m. on the first day of classes and my mind is screaming, \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d</p>\n                <p>English 515: Creative Nonfiction Workshop/Appropriation is the second graduate-level class I\u2019ve taken in my integrated bachelor\u2019s/master\u2019s program.</p>\n                <p>Going into it, I was incredibly excited. I love writing (if you couldn\u2019t tell by the fact that I write these columns for fun) and creative nonfiction is the niche within English that I plan on getting my master\u2019s degree in.</p>\n                <p>As class began, we went around the room introducing ourselves. Each of my classmates sounded so sophisticated, intelligent and confident. Just hearing them speak for a few minutes, I could tell that they were talented writers.</p>\n                <p>Despite the kindness of my professor and fellow classmates, I quickly felt out of place. They had their acts together and I most certainly didn\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>After that first class, I found myself struggling to write. I told myself that whatever I wrote needed to be perfect. I had to prove to everyone, and myself, that I belonged.</p>\n                <p>Words failed me as I stared at a blank Google Doc.</p>\n                <p>On the phone with my mom, I told her bluntly: I feel completely out of my depth.</p>\n                <p>I can imagine that for graduating students in the midst of starting new jobs, internships, or graduate programs, I\u2019m not alone in this feeling.</p>\n                <p>Something I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of is \u201cimposter syndrome.\u201d Psychology Today describes it as feeling \u201cundeserving\u201d of accomplishments and as doubting competency and intelligence.</p>\n                <p>If you were a so-called \u201cgifted kid\u201d or are, as Psychology Today puts it, a \u201chigh achiever,\u201d you\u2019re more likely to deal with this internalized feeling of not being enough. In fact, the outlet also says \u201caround 70 percent of adults may experience impostorism at least once in their lifetime.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Psychology Today indicates that to overcome imposter syndrome, you should stop comparing yourself to others and remember all that you\u2019ve accomplished.</p>\n                <p>You passed the interview process. Your application was accepted. You earned the right to be here.</p>\n                <p>On a different note, we often go into things expecting them to be easy. However, as is frequently the case in the great unfolding of life, things aren\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>As an anxious individual, challenge can sometimes manifest as discomfort. I so desperately want to feel like I\u2019m part of the group, especially in the field I hope to enter. When things feel off, it feels safer to retreat than to engage.</p>\n                <p>Let me remind you that just because things are difficult doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t worth doing.</p>\n                <p>Whether it\u2019s a new job, graduate school, or whatever your next step is, it\u2019s likely not going to be what you\u2019re used to. Give yourself time to adjust.</p>\n                <p>Everyone was once the newbie at something. It\u2019s OK to feel a little overwhelmed. The important thing is seeing it through.</p>\n                <p>Finally, let me share with you one of my favorite poems, \u201cWild Geese\u201d by Mary Oliver.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019ve turned to it in many a stressful and uncertain moment and it helps bring me a sense of calm.</p>\n                <p>I encourage you to read the whole thing, but the first line sums up what I hope you get out of this column: \u201cYou do not have to be good.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That sounds bad taken out of context, but what Oliver is getting at is you don\u2019t need to be perfect. You need to be you, and that\u2019s enough.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m looking forward to my next 515 class. I\u2019m not going to let self-doubt ruin what I\u2019m sure will be a rewarding opportunity for growth.</p>\n                <p>As Mary Oliver says, \u201cthe world offers itself to your imagination.\u201d Go forth and do great things.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s gymnastics takes a trip to the Midwest for a meet against Nebraska on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>This is the Nittany Lions\u2019 second Big Ten matchup, and they are coming off of a win against Illinois 316.800-311.000. The blue and white are having a strong season so far, with all wins except for a second-place finish at the Sam Mikulak Invitational earlier this season.</p>\n                <p>The Cornhuskers have seen less action than the Nittany Lions this season, competing in the Rocky Mountain Open against Oklahoma, Stanford, USAF Academy, Arizona State and the Rocky Mountain Mavericks. Ultimately, Nebraska finished in third, and also took a loss against Ohio State last Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a break after this meet, resuming the season on Feb. 20 for the Winter Cup, so seeing it have a chance to push for a win and end on a good note is expected.The Cornhuskers need a solid win to head in the right direction, so putting up a solid lineup and finding ways to push the Nittany Lions is another thing to expect.</p>\n                <p>Looking at areas of focus for the Nittany Lions, pommel horse and vault will be important since those are where most of the top numbers are coming from. Ricky Perez and Landon Simpson are looking strong to lead on pommel horse, with both gymnasts consistently putting up 13.500 and above all season. Simpson also comes in strong on vault, with Shaun Smith also having high numbers on the event.</p>\n                <p>The Cornhuskers have a few options to go head-to-head on vault against the Nittany Lions, with Luke James having 14.500 against Ohio State and Alex Nitache, who put up a 14.300. Nebraska likely chooses Nathan York for pommel horse, who secured a 14.000 against Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska will need to consider using athletes like James and York across multiple events and spread out its roster to target the areas the Nittany Lions excel.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has figured out its groove this season, having worked out the holes in its lineups and moved gymnasts around to be effective in more than one event. Nebraska has been using the same athletes in the same event and has not quite found a way to have high scores across multiple apparatuses.</p>\n                <p>Looking at starting a winning streak will be important for the Cornhuskers to have a successful rest of the season. With the strong roster of the blue and white, this meet could be a tool to test out what a possible lineup for Nebraska could look like against a more settled team.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

However, its success ran out in the postseason.</p>\n                <p>After defeating fifth-seeded St. Bonaventure 11-8 in the first round of the Atlantic 10 tournament, the Spiders scored the same amount of goals against No. 1 UMass, but ultimately fell 16-11.</p>\n                <p>Richmond had a pair of high-scoring attackers who led the team last year in Colleen Quinn and Alexis Morton.</p>\n                <p>While Quinn graduated, Morton is back for her senior year after a successful Year 3. The Manhasset, New York, native recorded 39 goals and 37 assists for 76 points \u2014 the second-most on the team.</p>\n                <p>On the goalkeeping end, junior Abby Francioli is back for another year after starting all 19 games last year.</p>\n                <p>Through 963 minutes, Francioli recorded 155 saves with a 46.5% save percentage.</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s matchup will likely be a battle in the net, as the Nittany Lions have a dominant goalkeeper of their own.</p>\n                <p>After cruising through her freshman year and being named Big Ten Freshman of the Year, Sydney Manning has been the go-to goalie for the blue and white. Last year, Manning recorded 110 saves in her 12 starts.</p>\n                <p>Despite Richmond being without last year\u2019s top scorer, it will still have plenty of other high-power attackers to challenge Manning.</p>\n                <p>The Spiders return their third, fourth, fifth and sixth leading scorers from last year, as Mortion and Juliana Stanley combine for 74 goals.</p>\n                <p>In just seven combined starts, Charlotte Edwards and Birdget Lonsinger also scored 31 total goals and will likely improve that number with more time on the field this year.</p>\n                <p>Just as Manning is challenged in the net, however, the Nittany Lions have plenty of offensive strength that should challenge Francioli.</p>\n                <p>Senior Erika Ho returns for her final season after leading the team with 46 goals last year. Twenty-goal-scorer Emma Kelly and 49-point scorer Kelly MacKinney will also take the field and earn many starts this year, providing further challenges to Richmond.</p>\n                <p>While both sides have their fair share of strengths heading into Saturday\u2019s game, the Nittany Lions will look to keep their undefeated all-time 11-0 record against Richmond alive.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s historic 2024 season earned the program its first NCAA Regional berth since 2011. The Nittany Lions were unable to build on that momentum in 2025, finishing 25-27 and falling in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white return significant experience and star power on both sides of the ball, and if all the pieces come together, coach Clarisa Crowell\u2019s squad could see its second Regional appearance in three years.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has made 11 NCAA Tournament appearances, but has never advanced past the Regional round. A push for the program\u2019s first Super Regional, and potentially a trip to the Women\u2019s College World Series in Oklahoma City, is possible in 2026, but the path won\u2019t be easy.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look at some of the top national competition Penn State will have to face in pursuit of a deep postseason run.</p>\n                <p>The SEC</p>\n                <p>The SEC is expected to be the most dominant conference in college softball this season. In 2025, the SEC set an NCAA record with 14 teams reaching the tournament, the most by any conference in history.</p>\n                <p>Twelve of the 25 teams in ESPN/USA Softball\u2019s preseason poll reside in the SEC, including half of the top-10. If the Nittany Lions reach the postseason, they\u2019ll likely have to get through at least one SEC team.</p>\n                <p>The team to beat is reigning national champion Texas. The Longhorns enter 2026 tied for the preseason No.1 spot with last year's runner-up Texas Tech. In each of the last four seasons, the preseason No. 1 team has won the national title.</p>\n                <p>Last season, Texas led Division I with 630 hits, finished second with 460 RBIs and third with a .352 batting average. The Longhorns return standout hitters senior Reese Atwood and junior Katie Stewart.</p>\n                <p>Atwood hit .393, with 21 home runs and a nation-leading 89 RBIs, earning her second-straight unanimous NFCA First Team All-American honor. Stewart hit .381 with 17 home runs and 80 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>Texas also returns its ace Teagan Kavan, who went 28-5 with a 2.16 ERA and 230 strikeouts in 207 innings pitched.</p>\n                <p>Other SEC contenders include Oklahoma, Tennessee, Florida and Arkansas.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will face Tennessee in Knoxville on Feb. 27 and 28. The Lady Volunteers owned the nation's lowest ERA last season at 1.82.</p>\n                <p>Since 2000, the Nittany Lions have made nine Regional appearances, and four have been hosted by SEC teams. Two of those, including the most recent one, were at Texas A&amp;M.</p>\n                <p>If history is any indicator, then Penn State might once again draw an SEC team if the Nittany Lions hear their name called on Selection Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Texas Tech</p>\n                <p>Texas Tech is coming off a historic season, finishing one win shy of a national title in its first-ever WCWS appearance.</p>\n                <p>The Red Raiders made headlines in the 2024 offseason by landing former Stanford ace NiJaree Canady, who led the Cardinal to two WCWS appearances and was named the 2024 USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year.</p>\n                <p>In her first season at Texas Tech, Canady posted a 34-7 record, 1.11 ERA and 319 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>This offseason, the Red Raiders added three NFCA All-Americans via the transfer portal, highlighted by Ohio State\u2019s Jasmyn Burns, former Florida Gator Mia Williams and ex-Tennessee slugger Taylor Pannell.</p>\n                <p>The Red Raiders bolstered their pitching depth with former UCLA arm Kaitlyn Terry, who owns a 2.50 career ERA.</p>\n                <p>The Red Raiders are expected to control the Big 12, with Arizona and Oklahoma State being the only other top-25 teams in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Florida State and Clemson</p>\n                <p>The last leg for Penn State would be the ACC, likely led by Florida State or Clemson.</p>\n                <p>The Seminoles enter the season ranked No. 7 and return strong duos on both sides of the ball. Pitchers Jazzy Francik and Ashtyn Danley were the ACC\u2019s top two arms, combining for a 1.55 ERA and just five total losses.</p>\n                <p>Offensively, Isa Torres and Kennedy Harp anchor the lineup. Torres led Florida State with a .436 batting average and struck out just five times. Harp hit .412 with 49 RBIs and tied for the nation 's-best mark of 10 triples. As a team, the Seminoles posted the ACC\u2019s second-highest batting average at .346.</p>\n                <p>Clemson, a program that debuted in 2020, is the only team on this list without a WCWS appearance. The Tigers reached a Super Regional last season before falling to Texas.</p>\n                <p>Clemson returns reigning ACC Freshman of the Year Macey Cintron, who went 8-2 with a 2.25 ERA. At bat, Cintron hit .292, recording 51 RBIs. Julia Knowler also returns after driving in 62 runs, batting .313 and hitting 15 home runs</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State baseball is on the rise. After recent success under coach Mike Gambino, the blue and white will seek to remain competitive in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Last season, the Nittany Lions marked one of their more successful years in recent history, finishing 33-23. In 2024, Penn State reached the Big Ten Tournament Championship, narrowly losing to Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>If anything, all indications are pointing to a successful season ahead. And, as the backbone of the roster, Penn State\u2019s outfield will have a shot to replicate its dominance from last year.</p>\n                <p>Luckily, Gambino and the Nittany Lions are welcoming continuity with four of their six outfielders returning. Penn State will embrace its large veteran presence.</p>\n                <p>Here is what you need to know.</p>\n                <p>Returners</p>\n                <p>Last season, Penn State was on the opposite end of the spectrum. The team welcomed a clean slate of outfielders, and it paid dividends.</p>\n                <p>College baseball has revealed several key factors to success, one of which is consistency. The Nittany Lions built their roster around the outfield, which generated an explosive offense last season. Among those talents was Paxton Kling, who led the team in batting average and left for the MLB Draft.</p>\n                <p>However, not far behind him was Jack Porter. Now, in his redshirt junior year, Porter will seek to replicate his past success.</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-1 Clearwater, Florida, native provides a versatile ability to aid with his hot bat. While batting .310, he also tallied 57 hits with a .549 slugging percentage. Porter will undoubtedly be the focal point of the offense as he started and played in 47 games last season.</p>\n                <p>Right behind him was Jesse Jaconski, who, like Porter, presents a utility threat, being able to play multiple positions. The former North Carolina and Hartford Community College transfer played a major role in last year\u2019s excellence from inside the batter\u2019s box.</p>\n                <p>Jaconski, a right-handed senior, started and played in 55 games, and marked the third-highest batting average at .298. But it's all about the power. His extreme efficiency accounted for 61 hits, 54 RBIs and 12 home runs.</p>\n                <p>Aside from two of last year\u2019s stars, Penn State will also welcome back Cohl Mercado, who played more of a backseat role. The 5-foot-8 redshirt junior, formerly transferred from Boston College, found a unique role in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Mercado started 38 games last season and played in 46 games, tallying a .230 batting average. He contributed 32 runs and 31 hits and endured spurts of struggle. While he wasn\u2019t a regular starter, there is momentum for him to fill out the final projected starting role on Opening Day.</p>\n                <p>Jack Messina is the final returner for Penn State, who is listed as a first baseman and outfielder. The State High product played in one game last season and tallied one at bat. He will likely be a bench reserve once more for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Transfers</p>\n                <p>Last year, the Nittany Lions proved the transfer portal is vital to success. Now, in a less urgent situation, Penn State\u2019s transfer prospects will look to add depth and balance to the lineup.</p>\n                <p>Penn State acquired two transfer prospects in this year\u2019s cycle, both of which came from non-power conference schools.</p>\n                <p>Maddox McDonald, a Trinity transfer, had success in Division III, leading the Bantams to a SCAC regular-season title, SCAC tournament title and the Division III regional final.</p>\n                <p>The stat sheet appears even better. McDonald appeared in 81 games, making 76 starts over his two seasons with the program. He batted .329 with a .532 slugging percentage across his collegiate career. As a steady bat, he also presents loads of speed, having successfully stolen 19-of-22 bases last season.</p>\n                <p>McDonald certainly will be in the mix for a starting role with the Nittany Lions, most likely in center field.</p>\n                <p>Justin Turcovski rounds out the small incoming class as a former Pitt-Johnstown transfer. The 5-foot-10, redshirt senior, will aid Mercado and Messina as the left-handed bats in the outfield.</p>\n                <p>This gives Turcovski a good chance to be featured in the lineup. Nevertheless, he had much success in his long tenure with the program. The Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, native played in 156 games, making 149 starts in his four seasons.</p>\n                <p>Turcovski has been a very consistent player over his career, batting .282, slugging .505 and securing a .373 on-base percentage. While he likely won\u2019t be in the starting mix, he might be featured as a player off the bench and used sporadically</p>\n                <p>Projected Starters</p>\n                <p>While Porter is the most experienced player amongst the group, he was used as a designated hitter last season. Still, he will likely aid Jaconski as the other veteran outfielder. These two will likely start in right and left field.</p>\n                <p>Behind these two, McDonald is most likely to start in center field, given his speed and reliable bat, providing highlight-level plays to patrol the grass.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>While a majority of Penn State\u2019s team can expect to see new faces sprinkled throughout in Kayla Treanor\u2019s first year, the defense and goalkeeper situations should remain fairly steady from last year.</p>\n                <p>With a majority of last year\u2019s line returning for another year, here\u2019s a look at the Nittany Lions\u2019 defenders and goalkeepers entering this season.</p>\n                <p>Returning defenders</p>\n                <p>Among the returners, redshirt sophomore Cailin Hetrick stands as one of two defenders who started all 16 games last year.</p>\n                <p>Despite her youth, Hetrick recorded 17 ground balls and caused eight turnovers while only giving up seven balls.</p>\n                <p>Alongside Hetrick is senior Maggie Driver, who took a big leap in Year 3 with 16 starts. Driver played arguably more aggressive defense, picking up 18 caused turnovers and 30 ground balls.</p>\n                <p>Lauren Tinson and Lily Spilker each found their spots in the starting lineups eight times apiece last season, making their marks on the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Tinson\u2019s stats weren\u2019t super flashy, but she recorded nine ground balls and five caused turnovers nonetheless. Spilker saw the same success with ground balls, but also forced 16 turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Ava Stummer, Lily Strohecker and Brooke Lattanzi all had little to no playing time last year and will look to see the field more this season.</p>\n                <p>Freshmen defenders</p>\n                <p>Compared to the rest of the position groups, Penn State\u2019s defense has the smallest freshman class with just two athletes.</p>\n                <p>Sarah Ann\u00e9 comes to Happy Valley as a two-time Utah Women\u2019s 5A State champion, earning the honor in 2022 and 2024. In that year, she was named the Utah State Playoff MVP and earned All-American honors from USA Lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>Susannah O\u2019Connell joins the Nittany Lions from a little closer to home, hailing from Summit, New Jersey. There, O\u2019Connell served as a tenacious defender, breaking her high school\u2019s record for most caused turnovers while earning USA Lacrosse All-American honors and being named a two-time All-State honoree.</p>\n                <p>Goalkeepers</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 premiere goalie over the past two years has been Sydney Manning, who\u2019s started in all but six games.</p>\n                <p>Now in her junior year, Manning will look to continue that stretch and improve on her performance. In her freshman year, she recorded a 41.3% save percentage and improved to 43.7% last year.</p>\n                <p>Out of the other three goalies on Penn State\u2019s roster, only Emily Bette has seen playing time, recording seven minutes in 2023. She will likely be the backup keeper for her senior year.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Arden Jansen and freshman Makenna Gagliardi have yet to see action for the blue and white and likely won\u2019t this year. Jansen won the district and league championship for Radnor High School in 2024, while Gagliardi was the 2023 and 2024 Suffolk County champion.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Veronica Figg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Press Cider &amp; Craft Beverage Taphouse opened last October at 113 Heister St. I\u2019ve passed by it multiple times on my way to class, but I\u2019ve never had the chance to go. I recently got the opportunity to try out their menu on a hopping Friday night where not only the drinks warm you up, but the atmosphere as well.</p>\n                <p>The Press invites you to take a seat wherever you like via a chalkboard near the entrance, and tells you to order at the bar when you\u2019re ready. The Press was lively when I arrived, with music playing from the speakers at a volume that was comfortable enough to hear your friends speaking. The taphouse has very warm lighting that gives the space a welcoming vibe.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s a drinks-only establishment with a bring-your-own-food invitation. I brought a wrap with me from On a Roll at Redifer Commons in Penn State\u2019s South Food District. My wrap had roast chicken, mayonnaise, sliced tomatoes, red wine vinegar, olive oil and Italian seasoning. I also got Miss Vickie\u2019s Salt and Vinegar chips as a side.</p>\n                <p>The Press\u2019s menu is organized into four sections: cider, wine and mead, craft PA beer, craft cocktails and non-alcoholic options. I ordered a flight of four 4 ounce samples and asked the bartender for recommendations on both their sweetest drinks and other popular favorites. He recommended I try number nine and number four as sweet options, and number two and number nine for favorites.</p>\n                <p>Number Nine: Chucklin Berry</p>\n                <p>Chucklin Berry was the sweetest drink and my favorite of the night. This is no surprise for a person with a love of sweet drinks (think strawberry daiquiris). It smelled sweet, but in a pleasant, fruity way. The drink was a cider with blueberry, strawberry and raspberry flavors, and the fruitiness of the drink made it very sweet.</p>\n                <p>The aftertaste was a very sweet strawberry flavor, and that paired with the blueberry was more pronounced in the drink over the hint of raspberry. This made for the cider to be smooth with a bit of a tang.</p>\n                <p>However, the hint of raspberry tied the drink together for a great three-berry flavor combination. I finished the whole thing and would recommend it for any fellow sweet drink lovers out there.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 10/10</p>\n                <p>Number Four: Cranpus</p>\n                <p>Number four was my second favorite. Cranpus was a half-cider, half-wine combination drink.</p>\n                <p>It smelled the sweetest, which made sense since it was half-wine. It was not as smooth as the number nine and in fact was a little sharp. This sharpness could have been from the drink\u2019s higher ABV.</p>\n                <p>I could taste the wine right away. The cranberry and pomegranate were the flavors that stood out the most, and they overpowered the subtle hints of raspberry.</p>\n                <p>Even with the overwhelming taste of cranberry and pomegranate, it was still one of my favorites and had a very sweet and fruity aftertaste.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Numbers nine and four tasted the best with my wrap and chips, with the sweetness of the drinks acting as a nice juxtaposition to the salty chips. This made for a great flavor combination.</p>\n                <p>Number 2: Ginger? I Pear-ly Know Her</p>\n                <p>This drink was dry, which is expected in an off-dry cider. What was not expected was the bitterness in both taste and smell.</p>\n                <p>The ginger also overpowered the pear where I could still taste it and it struck a nice balance, but I wished the pear would have been a little stronger overall. This drink wasn\u2019t my favorite, but for any ginger-lovers out there, this is the drink for you.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 6/10</p>\n                <p>Number 10: Monkey Step Wine Spritzer</p>\n                <p>I thought I was going to like this one because it was wine \u2014 I was wrong.</p>\n                <p>This drink smelled and tasted the most bitter, but still maintained a smooth finish.</p>\n                <p>The lavender was so overpowering I could not taste the blueberry flavor at all. The too-much lavender taste made this my least favorite drink of the four. However, for those of you who love the seasonal Starbucks Lavender menu, this would be heaven in a glass.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 4/10</p>\n                <p>Veronica\u2019s Food Sensitivity Corner</p>\n                <p>As a student who was recently diagnosed with a dairy sensitivity, I am always on the lookout for foods that fit my new dietary needs, and I am also aware there are other students who may have similar needs as well.</p>\n                <p>The ciders, wines and meads offered at The Press are all gluten-free.</p>\n                <p>I will definitely be returning to The Press in the future to get another glass of the Chucklin Berry and bring my friends along with me. For delicious drinks with a side of warm atmosphere, look no further than The Press.</p>\n                <p>A downside is The Press is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, but it\u2019s open on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 6 p.m. to midnight, and on Saturdays from 2 p.m. to midnight and Sundays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Over the past several weeks, Penn State has broken nearly a dozen school and NCAA records in various events.</p>\n                <p>Between Allon Clay\u2019s 1000-meter school record at the Nittany Lion Challenge and Handal Roban\u2019s 800-meter school record at the Penn State National Open, the Nittany Lions have looked unstoppable.</p>\n                <p>For the men\u2019s squad in particular, that success will pay off with the postseason drawing near.</p>\n                <p>In last week\u2019s USTFCCCA poll, the Nittany Lions were ranked No. 4 \u2014 the highest in program history. Coupled with four athletes with top-five marks in the country this season, the men\u2019s team is capable of winning its first Big Ten indoor title in program history.</p>\n                <p>Since the western expansion to the Big Ten, Oregon and USC have been the frontrunners in the conference, with Ohio State, Purdue and a few other schools popping up here and there.</p>\n                <p>While the Ducks and Trojans remain powerhouses this year, Penn State\u2019s success has been unmatched and may be enough to dethrone Oregon.</p>\n                <p>Across the board, the Nittany Lions have seen success in nearly every event, including Ajani Dwyer in the short sprints, Jake Palermo in the long sprints, Roban, Clay and Yukichi Ishii in middle-distance, Nick Sloff in long-distance and several dominant throwers.</p>\n                <p>According to the current top marks in the Big Ten this season, Penn State is expected to finish runner-up to Oregon with 87 points, falling short by 27 points.</p>\n                <p>However, with the current rate of growth by this year\u2019s squad, nothing is out of the question for the blue and white as its athletes have shown they\u2019re still far from the top of their games.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s 60-meter and 200-meter, Dwyer holds the No. 1 and No. 2 times in program history, respectively. While those times both lead the conference so far, the second-team All-American has stumbled out of the blocks in almost every race and is far from his potential.</p>\n                <p>After setting a new school record in 45.65 in the 400-meter last year, Jake Palermo is already just 0.33 seconds from that mark despite running just one race this year. In addition, he too leads the conference in his respective race.</p>\n                <p>Ryan Henry and Dylan Lambrecht each have top-five Big Ten marks in the shot put after setting the No. 4 and No. 5 marks in school history in January.</p>\n                <p>The weight throw has experienced similar success as Collin Burkhart threw a personal-best 21.22m throw last weekend to set the No. 5 throw in school history and the conference this season.</p>\n                <p>While those marks alone represent a successful Penn State squad, the mid-distance and distance groups push the team\u2019s Big Ten chances over the edge, with school records in the 800m, mile and 3000-meter this season.</p>\n                <p>Over the past month, Sloff has broken the school record in the mile and 3000m while setting the No. 2 mark in the 5000-meter.</p>\n                <p>However, the 1000m and 800m have seen the most success so far.</p>\n                <p>At the Nittany Lion Challenge, Clay, Roban, Ishii and Sloff set the No. 4, 8, 9 and 10 marks in NCAA history in the 1000m while Clay broke the school record. Two weeks later at the National Open, Roban and Clay ran the No. 2 and 5 marks in NCAA history in the 800m, also setting the top-two marks in school history.</p>\n                <p>With a little less than a month until the Big Ten championships, the Nittany Lions are in a strong position and capable of winning their first indoor conference title this season.</p>\n                <p>MORE TRACK AND FIELD COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn started its February off strong, earning an 85-82 overtime win on the road against Purdue on Wednesday night. This marked the Lady Lions\u2019 first victory since Dec. 20, and their first in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Now with some momentum on its side, the blue and white welcome a tough task in No. 12 Michigan State. Tipoff is set for 1 p.m. on Saturday at Rec Hall</p>\n                <p>The Spartans were also in action on Wednesday night, but didn\u2019t have as much to celebrate as Penn State did. Michigan State fell to No. 22 Maryland 86-70 on its home floor.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions put themselves up against one of the top scoring teams in the Big Ten. The Spartans average 85.5 points per game, which is third in the conference behind only Michigan and UCLA, who are the Big Ten\u2019s top two teams.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white may struggle with the high-octane Michigan State offense, as Penn State has held a conference opponent to under 80 points just twice this season.</p>\n                <p>Defensively, the Spartans hold opponents to 63 points per game, which is 11.5 points less than the Lady Lions' average per contest.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s win over the Boilermakers was paced by a 30-point performance from 5-foot-8 guard Kiyomi McMiller. This marked the sophomore\u2019s 22nd double-digit outing this season, along with the second time she\u2019s reached 30 points. Additionally, McMiller recorded five rebounds and a team-high nine assists.</p>\n                <p>McMiller\u2019s 19.4 points per game lead the Lady Lions and is tied for fourth in the Big Ten. The Silver Springs, Maryland, native also paces the offense with 4.5 assists per game.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State\u2019s leading scorer in its loss to the Terrapins was 6-foot-3 forward Grace VanSlooten, who scored 19 points. The senior also led the Spartans' box score with nine rebounds and four blocks.</p>\n                <p>VanSlooten is Michigan State\u2019s top scorer with 15.3 points per game. She\u2019s also the Spartans' leading shot blocker, with 24 on the season.</p>\n                <p>These two teams are similar in the way that both have multiple offensive weapons and don\u2019t rely on one go-to scorer.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle is right behind McMiller on the stat sheet, averaging 19.3 points per game. The redshirt junior recorded her seventh double-double of the season against Purdue, with 19 points and 20 rebounds.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions also see high production from sharpshooter Moriah Murray, who averages 10 points per game. The 5-foot-8 guard scored 15 points on Wednesday night after going 5-for-6 from beyond the arc. Murray\u2019s 2.8 made three-pointers per game are tied for the most in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State provides a balanced offensive attack, with five players averaging double-digit points. After VanSlooten, the Spartans second highest scorer is 5-foot-9 guard Kennedy Blair.</p>\n                <p>Blair netted 15 points against Maryland and averages 13.8 points per game on the season. The redshirt sophomore\u2019s 5.5 assists per game lead the team and is the fourth-best mark in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>As Penn State tries to build off its first conference victory, Michigan State enters Saturday's matchup looking to get back in the win column after dropping its last two games.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>ANN ARBOR, MICH. \u2014 At the University of Michigan, in the shadows of the Big House, lies Crisler Arena. Inside the complex lies a modern-day coliseum, which houses some of the best basketball the Big Ten has to offer. Coach Dusty May has led the No. 2 Wolverines to their best start in program history after a 110-69 drubbing of the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>21-1 Michigan fosters a program levels above the operation currently running in Happy Valley, built upon core principles that define the team over individuals in the NIL era.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a team of elite talents all coming together with a common goal,\u201d guard Nimari Burnett said.</p>\n                <p>May\u2019s success is derived from the established Michigan program attracting talent from around the country, then guiding it to camaraderie that keeps players in Michigan long term. Even after an 8-24 season, the team rebuilt to a top program in the country with a core of talented veterans staying the course.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(May) recruited a bunch of unselfish guys willing to do whatever it takes to win,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cWe love to see each other succeed while being elite talents.\u201d</p>\n                <p>But on top of the dominant play on the court, Michigan has the basketball experience perfected. Penn State basketball and the Bryce Jordan Center could take some notes.</p>\n                <p>An elite program and sustained success leads to gameday tradition that fosters an unforgettable experience. Much like Penn State football\u2019s success bred a fanbase known for its signature voice during plays, Michigan basketball has developed a devoted following united with sound.</p>\n                <p>A flock of students clad in pink, blue and maize entered the arena through the gates of Michigan Stadium. They filled up a student section the size of Penn State\u2019s early, then filled into sections 132 and 128 above the Wolverines\u2019 exit gate. 12,000 fans surrounded the students to create a full arena that hasn\u2019t been seen in Happy Valley in years.</p>\n                <p>Lights strung onto the guardrails of the staircases flashed, adding to the mystique, while fans sounded a boisterous yell for big moments, even in a small game for the home team. The fans united for a signature dance, similar to that of the Roar Zone, to honor veterans and to sing happy birthday to one of their players.</p>\n                <p>While the game itself was a breeze for a talented roster, with one media member quipping \u201cit was nice to have everything written by halftime\u201d after the game, the crowd continued to stay invested, blowing the Nittany Lions\u2019 home environment out of the water.</p>\n                <p>Even in the blowout, the people in the arena were brought together behind a story shared for \"Block Cancer\u201d night. A Michigan alumnus named Alyssa was brought in front of the crowd. She was diagnosed with cancer four months after the birth of her son and leaned on the University of Michigan Health to battle her diagnosis. 22 years later, her son has graduated from Michigan, and she stood healthy in front of her alma mater to a smattering of cheers as she delivered a message to an attentive community.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFind a way to enjoy life and always find a silver lining,\u201d Alyssa said as the crowd united behind her.</p>\n                <p>Crisler Arena was built in 1967, but it feels like luxury compared to the newer BJC due to renovations in the 2000s and investments into the building. It contains a museum, merchandise stores and features that feel like a professional environment rather than a college venue. The Bryce Jordan Center, much like the program it houses, feels like it has an identity crisis, holding back its potential.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a large donor base, a large arena to work with and some of the most passionate sports fans in the country. The school has everything needed to foster a program that can reach the heights of the Wolverines. But to do so, they must be willing to invest in basketball like Michigan to build a tradition that can withstand struggles and place Penn State in the upper class of college basketball.</p>\n                <p>However, the process won\u2019t be quick. Mike Rhoades continually talks about how the path to success in the NCAA is utilizing the transfer portal to build an older, experienced roster.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have to have a level of urgency in the program to move forward, and I'll do that,\u201d Rhoades said on Jan. 27. \u201cThe culture of college basketball now is to get older quicker.\u201d</p>\n                <p>However, that is unsustainable for a program like Penn State, which lacks the foundation to replenish those assets yearly. If Penn State wants to truly become a contender long-term, it has to start from the ground up, rather than putting band-aids on a terminal illness. The quick fix isn\u2019t compatible with the problem at hand.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has successfully built wrestling, volleyball and hockey into national mainstays over the last two decades and rebuilt a football program from sanctions unheard of at the time. The road to relevancy in college basketball will never get easier, but it's never too late to start climbing a mountain that won\u2018t move itself out of the way.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Penn State coming out victorious on Thursday was a tough task in itself. The Nittany Lions were entering a hostile environment at the Crisler Center against the No. 2 team in the country, Michigan.</p>\n                <p>This doesn\u2019t even factor in that Penn State was without key impact players, which left the team with just eight players.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019re undermanned,\u201d Mike Rhoades said. \u201cTheir size and length really hurt us early, and they got it going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State scored the first two points of the game, and proceeded to give up the next 15, and Michigan didn\u2019t look back from there.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe really made it hard on ourselves early in the game and put ourselves in a hole,\u201d Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>The biggest player missing from the lineup \u2014 literally and metaphorically \u2014 was 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107, who played a big role in Penn State\u2019s close loss to the Wolverines to begin 2026.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions fell to the Wolverines, 74-72, on Jan. 6, with Juri\u0107 scoring 20 points and four rebounds. The Zagreb, Croatia, native was 6-of-13 from the field and 2-of-5 from behind the arc.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously, they\u2019re injury-depleted,\u201d Michigan coach Dusty May said. \u201cJuri\u0107 had his way with us up there. We were looking for the challenge to see if we could do a better job on him because he\u2019s strong, he punishes switches, he made a couple threes against us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Juri\u0107 out of the lineup, and Sa\u0161a Ciani also ruled out before the game, Penn State started Josh Reed at center, lining up against 7-foot-3 Aday Mara for the opening tip-off.</p>\n                <p>When the 6-foot-8 forward wasn\u2019t the big man on the court, true freshman Justin Houser was the big man. Houser tallied the most minutes in a single game in his freshman season with 21.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, the Nittany Lions didn\u2019t have any answer for the paint presence of the Wolverines. Mara tallied 11 points and six rebounds, while 6-foot-9 forward Morez Johnson Jr. scored 12 points with eight rebounds.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen we played them at our place, I thought we out-toughed them and outplayed them, but we didn\u2019t win the game,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThey just beat us in all facets of the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Penn State didn\u2019t have any answers for Michigan\u2019s offense, allowing 110 points, the Wolverines seemingly had every answer for the Nittany Lions\u2019 offense until the game was out of reach.</p>\n                <p>The difference in the two defensive units wasn\u2019t close, as Michigan out-rebounded Penn State 44-21. This led to 22 second-chance points compared to the Nittany Lions\u2019 six.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t stop them either,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThey got themselves going, and they really scored a lot of (points). I mean, they hit a bunch of threes, but they really scored around the basket and that had us leaking.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades hopes to \u201chave (Juri\u0107) for the next game, when Penn State takes on USC. A unit that was fully depleted ultimately didn\u2019t stand much of a chance against a Michigan unit that\u2019s now 21-1.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe knew the situation we were in,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI felt we had to make 10 to 12 threes to give ourselves a chance today, and we didn\u2019t, but we didn\u2019t stop them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "How Matt Campbell is instilling core values into his version of Penn State",
    "author": "Lexie Linderman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Every morning, Matt Campbell parks his Ford Explorer in the Lasch Building parking lot and heads inside. The \u201cwhirlwind,\u201d as he called it, of the last two months has somewhat settled down, although he\u2019s still got a few more weeks on the road recruiting.</p>\n                <p>As Campbell walks through the halls of his new home, a family has somehow already been built. Penn State lost 50 players to the transfer portal and had just two 2026 signees, but Campbell and his staff put their heads down, meeting every day to discuss roster outlook.</p>\n                <p>Who was staying, who was leaving \u2014 they went through all of it all the time. But as Campbell looked to fill the holes and form a roster, he made one thing clear: If you want to be a Nittany Lion, you better embody the traits required of one.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like we went with the mentality of not wavering from who we want this football team to be,\u201d Campbell said Tuesday. \u201cWhat are the value systems of character, and young men that love the sport of football, young men that love Penn State, and I would say, most importantly, young men that understand the value of an education from this institution. Those core values were really critical for us to kind of build this football team forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It was the same required values for the staff, most of whom have an unwavering loyalty to Campbell. Offensive line coach Ryan Clanton called his boss \u201cthe best head coach in the nation\u201d without hesitation \u2014 the two have only been working together for three seasons, with 2026 set to be his fourth.</p>\n                <p>But it doesn\u2019t feel that way to Clanton. Campbell treats him the same now as he did on Day 1, and Clanton knows that\u2019s hard to find in today\u2019s era of college football, so he certainly doesn\u2019t take it for granted.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt felt like a family the day I arrived. It's never been different,\u201d Clanton said. \u201cIn all the years I've worked for him, it's never been like, \u2018well, I thought he was like this, and he's really like that.\u2019 He drives a Ford Explorer, you know, he's just like a normal dude, right?\u201d</p>\n                <p>The most loyal of them all is offensive coordinator Taylor Mouser, who was working at Little Caesars 12 years ago and calling every school in the country trying to find someone that would take a chance on him, even if it was just in the smallest role available.</p>\n                <p>Campbell was the only one who answered. Since then, Mouser has been with Campbell.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat that guy has done for me in my life, I'd still be at Little Caesars if it wasn't for coach Campbell, and I don't forget that,\u201d Mouser said. \u201cAnd it doesn't matter if he's made me the GA or he's made me the offensive recruiting quality control, whatever it is. I've tried to do it all just to repay him back for being the only guy that returned my phone call.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mouser and Clanton\u2019s devotion trickles down to every member of the staff, especially those who came from Iowa State. Safeties coach Deon Broomfield said Campbell has helped him learn and grow as a father and a husband, while quarterbacks coach Jake Waters knows he\u2019s working with a guy he loves and trusts.</p>\n                <p>Those relationships caught defensive line coach Ikaika Malloe\u2019s eye when defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn asked him to move cross country to Penn State. Malloe even drew similarities between Campbell and former Washington head coach Chris Petersen, who Malloe spent three seasons coaching under.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA guy that I hold dear to my heart is Chris Petersen. And his whole foundation was relationships, and that's what that guy is all about,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cSo I was excited to be a part of that and kind of join that, his philosophy, and the way he does it is very old school. It really is. You kind of earn your keep, and you get up and you work.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s often said that players are a reflection of their coaches, and coaches are a reflection of their players. And that\u2019s exactly how Campbell wants it. He\u2019s set on embodying the history and values of Penn State \u2014 unselfishness, integrity, humility, class and culture.</p>\n                <p>But Campbell also knows culture isn\u2019t built in a day, and it isn\u2019t just a word to throw around. \u201cIt\u2019s how you live, it\u2019s how you act, it\u2019s how you carry yourself,\u201d he says. And he\u2019s ready to inject that into a Penn State football program that lost it a year ago.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe sit in the proudest football tradition in all of college football. Do we understand that it's about those that came before us?\u201d Campbell said. \u201cDo we understand what we play for is bigger than us? Man, do we understand all the other things that come with football? Situational football, get in the best shape, playing for each other, all things that are critically important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State enters 2026 off its best season under coach Mike Gambino after going 33-23 with a 15-15 Big Ten record. A major part of the success was both stellar infield play and consistent hitting in the lineup.</p>\n                <p>However, after losing key players to the draft and graduation, Gambino looked to the transfer portal for talented additions. Along with the freshman class, the portal brought in several infielders who have the chance to fill much-needed voids.</p>\n                <p>The only certainty in the infield for Gambino is Bryce Molinaro starting at third base. Molinaro was drafted by the Washington Nationals, yet he elected to return for his junior year. The Drums, Pennsylvania, native started all 56 games at third base last season. He finished with a .267 batting average and 61 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt junior\u2019s RBI count sat at second all-time for a Nittany Lion in a single season.</p>\n                <p>The opposite corner was home to both Joe Jaconski and Cole Wagner throughout the season. The 2025 campaign marked Jaconski\u2019s last as he used all years of eligibility.</p>\n                <p>With both consistent hitters gone, many possibilities begin surfacing for the first base position. The front-runner for the open spot is Michael Anderson. The Havertown, Pennsylvania, native returns to his home state after spending his junior season with Arkansas. However, he last played a full season in his sophomore year at Rhode Island.</p>\n                <p>The senior finished with a .252 batting average and hit 13 home runs before going to Arkansas.</p>\n                <p>As for the middle infield, Gambino has a variety of returning and new players he could use at both positions. Jayden Davis could make an impact in his first year at Penn State, coming from a competitive SEC group. The Cookeville, Tennessee, native\u2019s best season with Vanderbilt came his sophomore year, where he hit .315 with 38 RBIs. His most recent season was cut short by surgery after an April injury.</p>\n                <p>With second base being his primary position and being a senior addition from the portal, Davis could hold the starting role at second for Gambino\u2019s unit.</p>\n                <p>Shortstop seems to be up in the air after Ryan Weingartner was drafted to the St. Louis Cardinals. Weingartner started all 56 games at shortstop, leaving possible competition for the vacant position.</p>\n                <p>Spencer Barnett could potentially come out of that competition with the new starting job. Barnett had a batting average of .278 and 26 RBIs after his last season with West Virginia. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, native displays versatility as he has played second base, shortstop and third base throughout his career.</p>\n                <p>Although finding more time at second and third base, Barnett has given up fewer errors at shortstop.</p>\n                <p>The rest of the infield consists of freshmen and new players from the portal who could use this season to learn and improve for next season. They could also be potentially called in as a backup option.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

The Wolverines dominated the entire game as they outscored the blue and white 56-24 in the opening half.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started off with the first basket by Freddie Dillione V, and then proceeded to get outscored 15-0, leading to a timeout on the floor with the Nittany Lions trailing 15-2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got its next points of the night from a Melih Tunca free throw attempt with 12:18 left in the first half. Dillione V put the squad on his back offensively, but anytime he scored a basket Michigan would answer back.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions offense was struggling with Kayden Mingo scoring his first points of the game with just under six minutes left in the half. Meanwhile, Michigan big man WIll Tschetter was spreading the ball all over the court as he had back-to-back assists on two-straight three pointers.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got bullied all around the court. The Nittany Lions allowed the Wolverines to score seven of the last eight field goals with 3:24 left in the half.</p>\n                <p>Morez Johnson Jr. drove through the entire team on the court, capping it off with a slam dunk, an easy layup and a fade away for three-straight baskets to extend Michigan\u2019s lead to 31. The Wolverines outscored Penn State by 32 in the opening half. The Nittany Lions entered halftime with a 56-24 deficit.</p>\n                <p>Michigan opened the second half on a 7-0 scoring run. Tunca scored the first points for Penn State, again from the free throw line. Michigan\u2019s defense had back-to-back blocks by Aday Mara.</p>\n                <p>Tschetter continued to fool the Nittany Lions as he did all night. The graduate student had a lob to Oscar Goodman for the easy dunk to give the Wolverines a 78-40 lead.</p>\n                <p>Mara continued to showcase his defensive abilities with another big block against Josh Reed. The Wolverines clamped Penn State from beyond the arc as the squad went 2-of-17 from downtown.</p>\n                <p>Penn State made Goodman look like he was the star player on the court. The redshirt freshman tallied six points.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defense was atrocious, allowing the Wolverines to shoot 63% from the field, and just as bad was the blue and white\u2019s offense, which shot 35% from the field.</p>\n                <p>The only decent stat the Nittany Lions had was from the free-throw line; the squad shot 77% from that spot, which was still worse than Michigan\u2019s 88 percent from the line.</p>\n                <p>After his second three-pointer of the game, Tschetter got the Wolverines to 100 points and then over that amount with back-to-back threes. Nimari Burnett was the main source of offense for the Wolverines, shooting 70% from downtown and leading the team in scoring with 31 points, which was half of what Penn State scored as a team.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got outrebounded 44-21 throughout the entirety of the game. Penn State got dominated with even less than a minute in the game, allowing Michigan to score two baskets off of lob passes. Penn State lost by 41, 110-69.</p>\n                <p>Injury report</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were without Ivan Juri\u0107, Eli Rice, Tibor Mirtic and Sasa Ciani for the game.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to the Bryce Jordan Center for a matchup with USC at noon Sunday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State is coming off its closest dual of the season with a 26-12 victory over Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>Now, the Nittany Lions will travel to face Michigan in an expected raucous environment at the Crisler Center. Last season, Penn State shut out the Wolverines, 39-0, in the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how the 2026 edition of the dual sets up.</p>\n                <p>125 pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 26 Diego Sotelo (UM)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl will take on Diego Sotelo for the first time in their careers. Against common opponents, Lilledahl is 15-3, while Sotelo sits at 16-9, giving Lilledahl the advantage.</p>\n                <p>This season, no wrestler has been able to keep up with Lilledahl\u2019s lightning pace as he\u2019s given Penn State the best option to lead off a dual. With the Nittany Lion\u2019s pace, Sotelo will have to stay steady as Lilledahl tends to get started quickly.</p>\n                <p>133 pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. Gauge Botero (UM)</p>\n                <p>After multiple tough matches for Marcus Blaze, the competition lightens up against the Wolverines. Gauge Botero holds a 4-11 record on the season and has struggled to keep up with the top competition.</p>\n                <p>This match could end quickly with Blaze\u2019s low, quick style, and if Lilledahl gets the dual started off on the right foot, Blaze could fully take the life out of the Crisler Center with a quick match.</p>\n                <p>141 pounds: No. 12 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 26 Dylan Ragusin (UM)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis will attempt to get back on the right track after losing by pinfall to Brock Hardy. Davis got out the gates quickly against Hardy, but got into a precarious position, allowing Hardy to take advantage.</p>\n                <p>Davis will face Dylan Ragusin, who\u2019s 6-3 on the season. The two wrestlers have a similar number of matches this season, but Davis has a tendency to come out on top against wrestlers ranked below him.</p>\n                <p>149 pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 13 Lachlan McNeil (UM)</p>\n                <p>The 149-pound bout is a rematch of the NCAA Tournament last season. Shayne Van Ness came out on top with a 7-2 decision against Lachlan McNeil, who was at North Carolina at the time.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness has wrestled on a new level this season and is the current top-ranked wrestler at the weight class. McNeil holds a formidable 11-3 record on the season, but Van Ness is on another level, with the next highest ranked Big Ten wrestler being Maryland\u2019s Carter Young at No. 4.</p>\n                <p>157 pounds: No. 4 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. No. 13 Cameron Catrabone (UM)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke lost his first match of his collegiate career to Antrell Taylor of Nebraska. However, he\u2019ll face Cameron Catrabone, who\u2019s dropped four matches this season.</p>\n                <p>Duke couldn\u2019t get to his offense against Taylor but with a wrestler ranked lower than Taylor\u2019s No. 3 spot, he could find more success and keep the train rolling on an impressive start to his career in a blue and white singlet.</p>\n                <p>Duke has a tendency to send the dual to intermission on a high note, and with Penn State having the higher-ranked wrestler at every weight class, it could happen once again.</p>\n                <p>165 pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. Justin Gates (UM)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink is the reigning national champion and is still undefeated in the 2025-26 season. Mesenbrink will take on unranked Justin Gates with a chance at a quick match.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink has taken the junior-year Levi Haines jump where there\u2019s more of a focus on back points. Against an unranked wrestler, Mesenbrink could earn nearfall points quickly, potentially ending this one early by fall.</p>\n                <p>174 pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 11 Beau Mantanona (UM)</p>\n                <p>Haines will face who Mesenbrink faced last season. Mesenbrink came out victorious with an 18-4 major decision over Beau Mantanona. Haines pinned his opponent last year against Michigan, but will face a much better wrestler in Mantanona.</p>\n                <p>Beau is 14-4 on the season compared to Haines\u2019 15-0 record, maintaining his perfect season. With Haines\u2019 highly ranked victories this season, it won\u2019t be a different look against the Wolverine.</p>\n                <p>184 pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 7 Brock Montanona (UM)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh has continued to grow his dominance this season, and is the lone undefeated wrestler left in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Brock Mantanona is No. 7 in the country but won\u2019t be a different look for Welsh, who has the biggest win of the season over former No. 1 Angelo Ferrari.</p>\n                <p>Welsh\u2019s strength has played a major factor and could play a huge factor again over the Wolverine.</p>\n                <p>197 pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 20 Hayden Walters (UM)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr is the final of four straight No. 1 wrestlers for the Nittany Lions. He\u2019ll take on a wrestler who\u2019s 7-4 on the season. Hayden Walters has yet to face a wrestler to the caliber of Barr, which could cause issues for the Wolverine.</p>\n                <p>Barr is 13-0 on the year and is on a tier of his own in the weight class. He holds the best victory in the class, defeating No. 3 Stephen Little earlier in the season. Returning to his home state, Barr could have a hometown showcase in Michigan.</p>\n                <p>285 pounds: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. No. 5 Taye Ghadiali (UM)</p>\n                <p>It\u2019ll be another major test for Cole Mirasola when he takes on Taye Ghadiali. The Wolverine just defeated Nick Feldman of Ohio State, a wrestler Mirasola lost to last season. Mirasola held a close bout against AJ Ferrari, but couldn\u2019t get over the hump against a top-five wrestler.</p>\n                <p>If Mirasola wants to re-insert himself into the top 10, he\u2019ll need a victory over Ghadiali to create mass parity in the Big Ten at the heavyweight position. Ghadiali\u2019s 16-2 record matches up with most wrestlers around him in the rankings.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Written on a piece of tape on Tessa Janecke\u2019s stick is \u201cBTGC,\u201d an abbreviation for \u201cBe the game changer,\u201d a message her parents would send her in her days of youth hockey, as reported by Kathryn Tappen on the NBC broadcast.</p>\n                <p>Janecke was certainly a game changer in her Olympic debut, recording a pair of assists in the United States\u2019 5-1 win over Czechia.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI tried to just do what I could,\u201d Janecke said during the second intermission. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a little different being at centre now, so it\u2019s more comfortable for me. I\u2019m just trying to play downhill in the [offensive zone] and create opportunities.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The name of the game was \u201cspeed,\u201d for the Americans and lots of it. Performing at such a quick pace and tempo, Team USA was able to maintain possession of the puck for the majority of the opening period.</p>\n                <p>Not only was speed a crucial factor from an offensive perspective, but a defensive one as well. The United States\u2019 defense prevented the Czechia offense from being able to cleanly enter the zone without resorting to dumping the puck. The United States was able to hold the Czechs to just one shot in the first 13 minutes of play.</p>\n                <p>With just under six minutes remaining in the first period, Team USA had a chance to open the scoring after Czechia goaltender Kl\u00e1ra Peslarov\u00e1 came out of her crease to play the puck but mishandled it behind the net.</p>\n                <p>On her way back to the crease she fell to one knee, making a save on a Kelly Pannek shot that deflected off Peslarova\u2019s back. Kirsten Simms nearly buried the loose puck, but Peslarova froze the puck on her side.</p>\n                <p>On a power play following a Dominika L\u00e1skov\u00e1 penalty for an illegal check, Hannah Bilka added another high-danger scoring opportunity for the United States, but Peslarova managed to get her glove down just in time. It seemed like the Americans could do everything but score.</p>\n                <p>Until they did.</p>\n                <p>Laila Edwards sent a one-timer pass from the faceoff dot to Megan Keller, who ripped a slapshot. On its way to the net, it deflected off the stick of Alex Carpenter and through the five-hole of the goalie Peslarova.</p>\n                <p>Not even two minutes into the second period, Czechia reminded United States goaltender Aerin Frankel to stay on her toes. Tereza Plosova skated around Britta Curl and Caroline Harvey and hit the post with her shot on a breakaway.</p>\n                <p>When the red, white and blue came out for the second period, they added another aspect to their already fast-paced game: crisp passes. The Americans seemed to utilize every square inch of the ice\u2019s surface, constantly moving the puck around, and it played a factor in increasing their lead.</p>\n                <p>From behind the cage, Janecke handled the puck and fired a quick centering pass to Joy Dunne, who scored her first Olympic goal to put Team USA up 2-0.</p>\n                <p>After a battle along the boards, less than two minutes later, Janecke fired a quick-look backhanded pass to Hayley Scamurra, who turned, battled a Czech skater, and fired the puck under Peslarova\u2019s left pad, giving the United States a 3-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Team USA continued to keep its foot on the gas, but hit a slight bump in the road on the way to victory.</p>\n                <p>Barbora Ju\u0159\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 was in the penalty box serving the final seconds of her two-minute minor for interference when the Americans sent a shot that rebounded off Peslarova and right on to the stick of Nat\u00e1lie Ml\u00fdnkov\u00e1. With Jurickova out of the box, Miynkova sent a pass up the length of the ice to Jurickova, who beat Frankel low-blocked to put Czechia on the board.</p>\n                <p>United States captain Hilary Knight added one more to the American lead with the 13th goal of her Olympic career, putting her third on the women\u2019s all-time list behind Natalie Darwitz and Katie King, who are tied with 14.</p>\n                <p>The Americans started the final period down a skater while Edwards served the remaining time on her tripping penalty that carried over from the second period.</p>\n                <p>After a successful penalty kill, Team USA continued to own the game in a controversial fashion. A potential missed tripping call against the United States resulted in Andrea Trnkov\u00e1 losing the puck, turning it over to Scamurra, who put Team USA up 5-1 with her second goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>The Americans had another power-play opportunity in the final minutes of the game and failed to score, but what they had already done was good enough to earn victory in their first game of the Winter Olympics.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The United States continues its preliminary round at 10:40 a.m. EST on Saturday when it faces Finland, its opponent in the semifinal round of the 2022 Winter Olympics.

    "description": "<p>Matilde Fantin and host nation Italy kicked off its home campaign in the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics against France on Thursday.</p>\n                <p>Behind a strong offensive attack and outshooting the French 46-15, Fantin and Italy put on a show for their home crowd against the French, winning the game 4-1 and putting themselves in an optimal position to advance into the quarterfinals.</p>\n                <p>Alice Philbert started between the pipes for France, while Martina Fedel got the start for the Italians.</p>\n                <p>Puck dropped with both sides easing into the contest, slowly putting pressure on both goaltenders.</p>\n                <p>France got the first blow ten minutes into the first period on the power play, with forward Gabrielle de Serres putting the puck past Fedel to give the Italians a 1-0 advantage early.</p>\n                <p>It was all Italy from there. Exactly one minute later, Italian captain Nadia Mattivi delivered an accurate pass to forward Kayla Tutino, who equalized the contest for the Italians 1-1.</p>\n                <p>As the second period began, the Italians started to dominate puck possession and had complete control over the neutral zone. In the closing minutes of the second period, Kristin Della Rovere carried the puck into the French zone and fired a shot that went off Philbert's pad. Rebecca Rocella took advantage of the opportunity and slotted the rebound into the back of the net, giving the Italians a 2-1 advantage going into the final frame.</p>\n                <p>Just 14 seconds into the third period, Penn State\u2019s own Matilde Fantin recorded her first-ever Olympic goal, unassisted, giving the Italians a 3-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>Four minutes later, Delle Rovere made up for her first opportunity in the second period, as she scored the fourth goal of the day for the Italians, assisted by Anna Caumo.</p>\n                <p>The Italians controlled the remainder of the contest, giving the French no chance to mount a comeback as Italy prevailed 4-1, giving them all three possible points.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Italians look ahead to their Group B match against Sweden at 8:40 a.m. EST on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPIC COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Germany and Sweden opened up the women\u2019s hockey event at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, and suited up for the blue and gold was Penn State sophomore Nicole Hall and former Nittany Lion Jessica Adolfsson.</p>\n                <p>Neither skater made it to the score sheet, but certainly had an impact in Sweden\u2019s 4-1 win over Germany.</p>\n                <p>Discipline was non-existent in the first period with three penalties called in the first 20 minutes of play, two against the Germans and one against the Swedes.</p>\n                <p>What Sweden lacked in discipline, it made up for in defense with multiple players sacrificing their bodies to block shots and redirect pucks, including Adolfsson. Sweden held Germany to just six shots in the first period.</p>\n                <p>Despite Germany being outshot in the first period by Sweden 14-6, the Germans got on the board first.</p>\n                <p>Just over 30 second into the power play after Sweden\u2019s Sara Hjalmarsson was called for slashing, Germany\u2019s Katarina Jobst-Smith rang one off the iron and past the Swedish goaltender Ebba Svensson Traff for the first goal of the Winter Games.</p>\n                <p>Even with the 1-0 lead, the Germans failed to build on the momentum. Sweden continued to test Germany's goalie Sandra Abstreiter with one-timers, but she managed to come up with an answer each time.</p>\n                <p>Sweden also had an offensive strategy of crashing the net which led to its first goal of the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>Just moments after a second unsuccessful power play, Sweden\u2019s Jenna Raunio ripped a shot from the blue line. Felizia Wikner Zienkiewicz redirected the shot on net and Abstreiter made the initial save, but Lina Ljungblom put in the rebound past the sprawled-out netminder to tie the game.</p>\n                <p>Hall was on Ljungblom\u2019s heels for Sweden\u2019s first goal, and nearly gave it the lead later in the period. Cutting towards the net with just over a minute remaining in the opening period, Hall had a centering pass sent her way, but got tied up with Germany\u2019s Daria Gleissner in front of the net as the puck slid to the corner.</p>\n                <p>The penalty trend continued in the second period, though not as sudden as it did in the first. Just over five minutes into the period, Sweden\u2019s Hanna Olsson drew a tripping penalty against Celina Haider, giving the three crowns its third power play of the game.</p>\n                <p>Compared to its first two power plays, the result was different but the name in the goal column wasn\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>With 30 seconds remaining on the man-advantage, the Swedes executed a set of tic-tac-toe passes. From atop of the far-side faceoff circle, Mira Jungaker fired a cross-ice pass to Sofie Lundin, who immediately sent it to Lisa Johansson, who fired a shot off the pads of Abstreiter. Similar to her first goal, Ljungblom cut to the net and snuck a backhand shot past the left skate of Abstreiter and into the back of the net to put Sweden up 2-1.</p>\n                <p>After assisting on Sweden\u2019s first power-play goal, Jungaker was responsible for scoring its second goal with the extra skater. From the edge of the trapezoid, Johansson sent a pass to the open Jungaker who fired a shot from the top of the near-side faceoff circle through traffic and straight to the net to extend the Swedish lead to 3-1.</p>\n                <p>On the other side of the ice, Svensson Traff faced just three shots on goal in the second period, but made a spectacular save with the left pad on a backhand shot from Mira Hallin after the German executed a perfect toe drag to get past Adolfsson.</p>\n                <p>The German offense looked its best in the third period, matching its shot total from the first period in a fraction of the time. Germany had multiple scoring chances to cut away at its deficit, but couldn\u2019t get one by Svenson Traff.</p>\n                <p>The 21-year-old netminder was unbeatable after the first goal she allowed and handled the increased offensive pressure from the Germans, including making a save despite being screened by the German forward Julie Schiefer.</p>\n                <p>Sweden added another goal to its total after Hilda Svensson sent a centering pass to Thea Johansson, who effortlessly put it past Abstreiter from in front of the crease to make it a 4-1 game.</p>\n                <p>After nearly scoring in the final minutes of the opening period, Hall had another scoring opportunity late in the third. She ripped a shot that deflected off Abstreiter\u2019s glove, and Josefin Bouveng couldn\u2019t bury the loose puck.</p>\n                <p>Germany will regroup and face Japan at 6:10 a.m. EST on Saturday while Sweden looks to extend its win streak against Matilde Fantin and Team Italy at 8:40 a.m. EST on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Ava Crawley | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Drum, Penn State\u2019s Student Black Caucus\u2019 Magazine, hosted an art gallery on Wednesday in the Eisenhower Auditorium. Featuring sculptures, paintings, photographs, videos and virtual reality exhibits, the auditorium was transformed by original student artwork highlighting the diversity of the Black diaspora.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere are so many things that are trying to silence Black and Indigenous voices right now,\u201d Diane Akpovwa, a writer for The Drum said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have this centralized space where we can feel safe and discuss ideas that are complex and uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Akpovwa, a fourth-year studying human-centered design and development, displayed multiple personal pieces throughout the auditorium including a virtual reality experience showing Nigeria\u2019s current economic conditions, a painting focused on the return of Indigenous African knowledge to its rightful owners and a sculpture series portraying the ever-changing standards for Black Queer bodies. While every piece differs in message and medium, they all collectively celebrate Black art.</p>\n                <p>Like Akpovwa\u2019s pieces, other students' artwork were carefully placed around the gallery. Among the artwork were plaques explaining each piece, vibrant charcuterie boards and curated Nigerian drinks. After weeks of preparations, Ruth Tefera\u2019s vision came to life.</p>\n                <p>Tefera, editor-in-chief of The Drum and a third-year student studying information sciences and technology, planned this gallery for months alongside Sita Frederick.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI can\u2019t lie, it was definitely a long process,\u201d Tefera said. \u201cOne of the hardest things was the curation aspect of it, reaching out to students that I saw were doing amazing work and convincing them that their work was good enough to be exhibited was challenging. I feel like a lot of artists don't see themselves as good enough to be in these spaces.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Frederick, the director of the performing arts, felt blessed to get the opportunity to work with Tefera and other students on The Drum.</p>\n                <p>\"It\u2019s honestly really exciting to partner with The Drum on this,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to do something like this, so to see students take it and run with it is totally inspiring to me. It is a collaboration with a student group that has a vision for how they want to create a community for Black students and for allies to come into this space and celebrate liberation, so it\u2019s really important to me as a woman of color.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Following the exhibit\u2019s successful debut, Tefera hopes to collaborate with the Eisenhower Auditorium again in the near future.</p>\n                <p>The artwork, displayed on the lower level and in the conference room, will remain on display through March, offering more Penn State community members the chance to admire the countless pieces and their different messages.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Alli Satterfield | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>\u201cDancing With the Stars: Live!\u201d brought dance, music and entertainment to the Bryce Jordan Center Wednesday night as fans of the show flocked to see their favorite professional dancers, or pros, live.</p>\n                <p>The performance capitalized on social media trends throughout, using viral songs like \u201cwe can\u2019t be friends (wait for your love),\u201d \u201cWHERE IS MY HUSBAND!\u201d and \u201cOpalite,\u201d while also making reference to the most recent season\u2019s most viral moments. Jenna Johnson\u2019s abs, Val Chmerkovskiy's knee walks and Ezra Sosa\u2019s alleged relationship with celebrity partner Jordan Chiles were all fuel for quips by the co-hosts of the show, Dancing With The Stars pro Emma Slater and celebrity contestant Danielle Fishel.</p>\n                <p>But, the dance performances weren't entirely based in modern, trendy concepts. The show featured a Gatsby-esque set design and one showgirl-themed number to \u201cCopacabana.\u201d The night\u2019s show also made frequent use of its performers\u2019 popularity and sex appeal.</p>\n                <p>Debby Zurinski, who works for Empower Retirement and attended Wednesday\u2019s performance, said her favorite dances were the ones featuring Val Chmerkovskiy. She said she could feel the energy in the room.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe crowd went wild every time Val was up on stage, especially when the men took their shirts off,\u201d Zurinski said. \u201cIt was good. It was fun.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She also noted people of all ages were in attendance \u2014 the entertainment brought generations together and acted as fun for all.</p>\n                <p>A lot of mother and daughter duos flocked to the BJC for the show. Zurinski was there with her sister, who she said is a bigger fan of the television show than she is. But, Zoie McClellan, who is currently a senior in high school, was there with her mom.</p>\n                <p>McClellan said she was so impressed by the length of the show and the intensity it must cause for the dancers.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very [impressive] how the dancers are able to perform so much in one night and remember all of that,\u201d McClellan said.</p>\n                <p>She was also impressed by the quality of each dance and said she enjoyed each of them.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey were all so amazing, I don\u2019t think I could just pick one [favorite],\u201d McClellan said.</p>\n                <p>But, other attendees, like Kimberley Conley, could pick favorites. Conley, like Zurinski, thought the best dance numbers of the night were those featuring Val. She said he is her favorite pro on the show.</p>\n                <p>Chmerkovskiy is just one of the professional dancers that ABC\u2019s Dancing With the Stars has made into a celebrity themselves. His brother Maks and the Arnold Sisters are among others that have transformed their Dancing With the Stars stardom into social media and podcasting fame, as well.</p>\n                <p>Their influence isn\u2019t necessarily new, however. Dancing With the Stars first premiered in 2005, and fans have been taking inspiration from the show since then. Conley, a registered nurse, even became an amateur ballroom dancer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually, when they first started, started taking ballroom lessons, and I do that a little bit on the side.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In its 20 years on the air, the show has inspired a generation of dancers and fans and cultivated a dedicated base of voters. Recently, it\u2019s grown in popularity and this season, it received a record-breaking number of votes \u2014 over half a billion \u2014 according to Slater\u2019s speech during the performance.</p>\n                <p>That energy and hype was evident Wednesday night, as the crowd\u2019s cheers reverberated off the walls of the BJC and the attendees\u2019 dance moves rocked the arena\u2019s seating.</p>\n                <p>The DWTS cast reciprocated that energy through the totality of their performance. They served sharp dance moves and engaging facial expressions to each carefully-chosen song. Each number transitioned into the others and many were reflective of what\u2019s popular right now.</p>\n                <p>In between numbers the cast also kept their audience engaged with jokes, banter and audience participation. One lucky audience-member was even pulled on stage to dance with them during a skit about dance technique enforcement.

    "description": "<p>In the months after Kayla Treanor was hired as the next coach for Penn State women\u2019s lacrosse, Treanor cleaned out the former coaching staff and brought in some new faces for this year.</p>\n                <p>Treanor added four new coaches and staff to her squad this season and kept just one from the Missy Doherty era.Here\u2019s a look at who will be leading from the sidelines this season for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Head coach</p>\n                <p>Treanor comes to Happy Valley with a lot of experience as both a coach and a player.</p>\n                <p>After a four-year playing career with Syracuse, where she was a four-time NCAA tournament semifinalist and four-time first-team All-American, Treanor picked back up the sport on Team USA, winning gold at the 2017 and 2022 World Championships.</p>\n                <p>Treanor\u2019s lacrosse journey continued as a coach, spending a year at Harvard and then four years at Boston College.

    "title": "How to stay warm in State College",
    "author": "Lexi Cannan | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Winter in State College hits fast. One day you\u2019re fine, the next you\u2019re freezing and adjusting your whole day.</p>\n                <p>Walking across campus gets harder, warm buildings become a priority and staying comfortable suddenly matters more than anything else. At some point, you stop trying to be cozy and start trying to function.</p>\n                <p>Cold weather changes your priorities. You stop caring about convenience and start caring about what actually works. It\u2019s the little things \u2014 heat, dry hands and not standing outside longer than necessary.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how students can actually get through it.</p>\n                <p>Find warmth and stay there</p>\n                <p>The second you feel warmth, don\u2019t move. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re early, late or pretending to study, warm buildings come first. Standing near vents becomes normal, and once you find a good spot, you don\u2019t tell anyone.</p>\n                <p>You start doing small things just to stay inside. Sitting through a few extra minutes of class. Rereading the same paragraph in the library because the heat is perfect. Taking the long way just to avoid the wind.</p>\n                <p>Leaving a warm building is always a mistake. You open the door, feel the cold hit your face and instantly regret every decision. If a building has good heat, it becomes part of your routine.</p>\n                <p>Hot drinks are just hand warmers</p>\n                <p>The drink itself barely does anything. You can buy coffee, tea or hot chocolate, but half the time it's already cold. You\u2019re really just holding the cup for warmth.</p>\n                <p>You\u2019ll carry that empty cup across campus like it\u2019s still doing something important. It stays in your hand through lectures, hallways and quick stops inside, all for a little extra heat. It only feels okay to throw away once you're fully inside.</p>\n                <p>Showers become a coping mechanism</p>\n                <p>Showers stop being quick. You stand there longer than you need to, just enjoying the heat. The hardest part is turning the water off and realizing you have to exist in cold air again.</p>\n                <p>The foggy mirror is the only proof you were warm at some point. You linger a few extra seconds, hoping the bathroom somehow stays warm forever. Eventually, you step out, immediately regret it and question why winter has to be this dramatic.</p>\n                <p>Hands give up first</p>\n                <p>Cold hands make everything harder. Texting becomes impossible. Your phone doesn\u2019t recognize your touch, so typing gets difficult. You shove your hands into pockets, sleeves, anywhere that might help until you end up grabbing hand warmers from McLanahan\u2019s on the way to class.</p>\n                <p>At that point, warmth isn\u2019t about comfort, it\u2019s about getting anything done. You start seriously considering those texting gloves that claim they work, even though you don\u2019t fully trust them.</p>\n                <p>Typing one text takes forever, autocorrect does whatever it wants and sending anything without mistakes starts to feel like an accomplishment.</p>\n                <p>Going back out is not happening</p>\n                <p>Once you get back home, you\u2019re done going out. You drop your stuff, sit down for \u201cjust a minute,\u201d and suddenly it\u2019s the rest of the night. Any plans you had start feeling optional. Going back outside sounds like too much effort, and staying in just makes more sense.</p>\n                <p>Plans turn into movie nights, warm food and sweats. It\u2019s simple, comfortable and honestly enough. Once you\u2019re settled in, leaving again doesn\u2019t even cross your mind.</p>\n                <p>The night slows down, the heat\u2019s on and everyone relaxes a little. Blankets get pulled out and claimed fast. Nothing exciting happens, and that\u2019s kind of the point. You\u2019re warm, you\u2019re home and you don\u2019t have to go anywhere , which feels like a win.</p>\n                <p>Layering saves you</p>\n                <p>Layering isn\u2019t about style, it\u2019s about options. You add things knowing you\u2019ll probably take them off later. Hat, scarves and gloves come out even if you didn\u2019t plan on wearing them all day. At a certain point, you don't care, you just want to be warm.</p>\n                <p>Scarves end up over your face. Gloves come on and off all day. Once the hat\u2019s on, it stays on. You don\u2019t look great, but you\u2019re warm. It\u2019s worth it.</p>\n                <p>Complaining just happens</p>\n                <p>Talking about how cold it is just becomes normal. It\u2019s the first thing people say when class starts, and everyone gets it.</p>\n                <p>Staying warm isn\u2019t about doing anything special. It\u2019s about getting through the day and making it back inside. That\u2019s the goal. You get to class, walk across campus and get home. If you did that without freezing, you did okay.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "author": "Sami Altmire | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State is headed to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to take on the women\u2019s gymnastics powerhouse, LSU. The Tigers are a legendary program, one of the most decorated and this allows a great lineup for the Nittany Lions for good competition outside of the Big Ten schedule.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have been excelling in the Big Ten, not losing a matchup so far this season. This opens up for a great showdown between a confident Penn State and a really strong LSU team.</p>\n                <p>The No. 3 Tigers have been going strong all season, and had an intense showdown over the weekend against No. 7 Missouri, narrowly winning 197.675-197.500. LSU also defeated two other strong programs, No. 4 UCLA and No. 5 Utah, and tied No. 1 Oklahoma, but fell in the tiebreaker, in the Sprouts Farmers Market Collegiate Quad.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are ranked No. 14 in the NCAA rankings, and although they have been on a winning streak, LSU is a formidable foe with a lot of depth.</p>\n                <p>For the Nittany Lions, having their lineup full of multi-event gymnasts will be their best bet. All-around athletes can cover all of their bases in terms of events, so putting gymnasts like Jessica Johanson, Allison Kaempfer, Dani Latronica and Elizabeth Leary in the lineup will be game changers.</p>\n                <p>LSU has all-around gymnast Kailin Chio, who was named the NCAA Vault Champion with a score of 9.975 and has a season high of 10.000. Chio also got a score of 9.950 on bars and 9.975 on floor. Konnor McClain is another great option for the Tigers this weekend, with season highs of 9.975 on bars, 9.950 on beam and 9.900 on floor. McClain also competed in every meet for LSU during the 2025 season.</p>\n                <p>This matchup will be a battle on bars, with both teams being extremely strong on that apparatus. Penn State has always been notoriously good on the bars, with many of the past meets this season seeing some strong scores posted by its gymnasts. Latronica has a 9.950, Ava Piedrahita has a 9.925, Leary and Johanson both have a 9.825 and Ava Cash and Kaempfer both have a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>LSU gymnasts have a strong history with bars, with the majority of the roster having over a 9.900 for the 2026 season. Courtney Blackson has a high of 9.950, Madison Ulrich has a 9.925 McClain has a 9.950.</p>\n                <p>The bars are most likely where most of the tight numbers will come from, but there is a lot more competition ready to happen all around. Both teams are at the top of their conference, and both rosters are lined with talent. This meet will be one for the books and worthy of the watch.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Greatest love songs of all time",
    "author": "Brennan Kramp I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Music, one of the world's greatest communicators and most personal art forms, has been allowing artists to express love for generations. Becoming a classically typical theme in music, love in all of its forms has helped propel artists to new fame and peeled the curtain back on them, showing a more vulnerable side to their creativity and musicianship.</p>\n                <p>Even though it\u2019s a near impossible task \u2014 coming up with a short list of the greatest love songs of all time \u2014 here are my top picks to listen and enjoy with your special person.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCant Help Falling In Love\u201d by Elvis Presley</p>\n                <p>A list of greatest love songs without the King\u2019s classic hit would be immediately labeled incomplete \u2014 if not, inaccurate. It\u2019s almost a shame how commercialized this song has become due to its undying popularity as a classic love song.</p>\n                <p>What gives this song its longevity is largely due to the colossal impact Elvis Presley had on music culture as a whole, but also because it\u2019s one of the most prominent songs in his discography where he moves himself into a completely different state of mind to sing with that level of intention and passion. Much to the same effect real love has on you.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d by Al Green</p>\n                <p>The beginning track to Al Green\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d album is by far one of the most memorable soul-groove love songs to date. Whether you realize it or not, you\u2019ve heard this song. Be it in a movie, TV show \u2014 or you\u2019re just a fan of good music \u2014 you\u2019ve heard the mellow swoon of Al Green\u2019s voice. It\u2019s an incredibly bold-faced song that, lyrically, is comfortingly honest and vulnerable.</p>\n                <p>The very first lyrics read, \u201cI\u2019m so in love with you / Whatever you want to do is alright with me / Cause you make me feel so brand new.\u201d If that isn\u2019t a perfect representation of honest love then nothing else is.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d by Taylor Swift</p>\n                <p>For the rabid Swifties out there who have gotten this far and are still wondering where their musical-hero is on a list of love songs, fret not.</p>\n                <p>Taylor Swift is one of the greatest musical superstars to ever walk the Earth \u2014 breaking virtually every record from touring attendance to streams to practically sweeping through the Grammy Awards at one point or another, Swift has built a large reputation and discography off of a bountiful amount of love songs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou Belong With Me,\u201d was a radio hit in its release back in 2008, reaching No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and being certified platinum six times over. A youthful, jealous high school anthem, written as if it were pulled from the plot of a Hallmark movie, \u201cYou Belong With Me,\u201d spoke to an entire generation of young adults sitting in their poster covered rooms messaging their special person over AOL and fusing their spirits to the lyrics of Swift's smash hit.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYesterday\u201d by The Beatles</p>\n                <p>It is nearly impossible to pinpoint what the greatest Beatles love song really is. Every one of their albums seemingly has about three to four tracks that could contend for the number one spot. However, the one that seems to be in every debate, surrounded by a plethora of other amazing Beatles\u2019 ballads, is their 1965 classic, \u201cYesterday.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The song is, to put it simply, happy and sad. The lyrics show a starkly contrasting view on love with McCartney first singing, \u201cYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,\u201d then going on to sing, \u201cWhy she had to go, I don\u2019t know, she wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n                <p>To have McCartney explain it, \u201cyesterday\u201d when \u201cshe\u201d was there, \u201clove was such an easy game to play\u201d and now he\u2019s \u201cnot half the man\u201d he used to be. It\u2019s a song that gives a glimpse into the true power love can hold over someone, and the unfortunate despair it can cause when it disappears.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFade Into You\u201d by Mazzy Star</p>\n                <p>Maybe the most overplayed wedding song in the history of weddings (for understandable reasons), Mazzy Star\u2019s 1993 album opener \u201cFade Into You,\u201d has been the essential slow dance song for anyone brave enough to go up and ask someone.</p>\n                <p>Gaining its popularity from a fantastic uprising of early 90s female rockstars, \u201cFade Into You\u201d is a relatively minimal song, lyrically, but the ensemble of a low-tempo acoustic guitar, piano, slide guitar and tambourine, all make for an extremely intimate and innocent track that will make both you and your partner absolutely swoon.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

The blue and white are coming off a 25-27 campaign, where it reached the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will kick off the 2026 season with a Friday doubleheader against Missouri and Boston College.</p>\n                <p>Missouri</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will open with a 10 a.m. matchup versus Missouri. The Tigers finished 2025 at the bottom of the SEC standings with a 25-31 record.</p>\n                <p>Missouri posted the conference\u2019s lowest offensive production with a .255 batting average and lost lots of key bats to graduation and the transfer portal. However, the Tigers also added a major offensive boost in senior East Carolina transfer Emma Jackson.</p>\n                <p>Last season, the Chincoteague, Virginia, native hit .326, with 58 hits, 54 RBI and a program record 21 home runs. Jackson is a two-time Second-Team All AAC selection and will look to boost Missouri\u2019s offense in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Junior Stefania Abruscato is the Tigers' top returning run producer after totaling 19 RBI in 2025. The Smithtown, New York, native also posted a .244 batting average, 38 hits and a team-high 15 doubles.</p>\n                <p>Offense fueled Penn State in 2025 as the Nittany Lions finished sixth in the Big Ten with a .329 batting average. The blue and white bring back its best offensive weapon, Brooke Klosowicz.</p>\n                <p>The junior utility player set single-season records with 23 doubles and 53 RBI, while recording a team-high 65 hits and striking out just 11 times.</p>\n                <p>In the circle, Missouri finished 2025 in the bottom half of the SEC with a 3.74 ERA. The Tigers lost their ERA leader and primary closer, Taylor Pannell, to the transfer portal, but return starters Cierra Harrison and Marissa McCann.</p>\n                <p>McCann went 10-12 with a 3.69 ERA and a team-high 113 strikeouts. Harrison was Missouri\u2019s only pitcher with a winning record, finishing 10-8, with a 3.94 ERA and 89 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns Abigail Britton, who logged the second-most appearances and innings last season. Britton finished 2025 with a 6-10 record, 5.89 ERA and 79 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>As a staff, the blue and white had the highest ERA in the Big Ten at 5.76.</p>\n                <p>Boston College</p>\n                <p>Penn State will face Boston College at 1 p.m. to close Friday's doubleheader. It\u2019ll be the Eagles\u2019 second game of the day after a morning matchup against Eastern Kentucky</p>\n                <p>Boston College finished 22-29 last year and missed the ACC Tournament after placing last in the conference.</p>\n                <p>The Eagles finished near the bottom of the ACC in both hitting and pitching, posting a .256 batting average and 4.87 ERA.</p>\n                <p>The factor that both the Eagles and Nittany Lions have in common is that both have young teams. Boston College has only four seniors on its roster, and Penn State has just two. Two of those seniors, Janis Espinoza and Meghan Schouten, are the Eagles\u2019 best returning bats.</p>\n                <p>In 42 appearances, Espinoza hit .275, with 28 hits and 12 RBI. Schouten is Boston College's top returning run producer after recording 18 RBI last season.</p>\n                <p>Two hitters to watch for the Nittany Lions are junior Michela Barbenente and sophomore Natalie Lieto. In 2025, Barbenente hit .284, with 33 hits and 36 RBI, while Lieto batted .329 with 49 hits and 30 RBI.</p>\n                <p>Boston College returns its top two pitchers in sophomore Bailey Kendziorski and junior Kelly Colleran, who combined for 281.1 innings last season. Kendziorski posted the team's lowest ERA at 4.51, while Colleran led the Eagles with 89 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State counters with junior pitchers Bridget Nemeth and McKenna Young. Nemeth missed last season, but served as the Nittany Lions\u2019 ace in 2024, finishing 23-8 with a 1.77 ERA and 202 strikeouts. Young, a transfer from South Dakota, recorded a 2.46 ERA and a 14-8 record in 2025.</p>\n                <p>One storyline to note is that Boston College is in its first season under former Saint Francis head coach Beth Krysiak. Penn State junior shortstop Kaylie Walters spent her freshman season at Saint Francis under Krysiak.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>After a historic weekend for hockey at Happy Valley, the focus is shifted back to closing out a successful season for No. 4 Penn State. The Nittany Lions closed out a series for the books with a 5-2 comeback win over Robert Morris, ultimately sweeping the Colonials.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white hit the road one last time this season as it travels to Maryland Heights, Missouri, for a series against Lindenwood. Game 1 of the series starts at 5 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n                <p>The two teams met earlier in the season, and Penn State swept the Lions, outscoring them 11-1.</p>\n                <p>Depth shines</p>\n                <p>Penn State played its first series without its three Olympians. Tessa Janecke, Matilde Fantin and Nicole Hall have landed in Milan, Italy, and will soon begin their games later this week. With one of the three forwards being first-line center Janecke, a hole in the first line had to be filled. Enter McKenna Walsh.</p>\n                <p>The Oswego, Illinois, native didn\u2019t wait long to prove she is capable of stepping in for Janecke\u2019s absence. Walsh scored the first-ever Penn State goal inside Beaver Stadium, then later followed it up with a goal in the second game of the series. Ultimately, the forward finished the weekend with two goals in two games.</p>\n                <p>Mya Vaslet made her name heard as she assisted on two goals in the second game, as well.</p>\n                <p>Scouting Lindenwood</p>\n                <p>Lindenwood has planted its foot on the gas for the last two weeks. The Lions have won five of their last six, ultimately acquiring sole possession of third place in the AHA. They are fresh off their second-straight series sweep at home.</p>\n                <p>When a team has produced the way the Lions have, several players make their presence felt. Three Lindenwood players earned AHA Women\u2019s Player of the Week awards this week. Forward Molly Henderson, defenseman Ellie Muscedere and goalie Lexington Secreto were honored by the conference for their performances last weekend.</p>\n                <p>A key contributor to Lindenwood\u2019s offense in its most recent series was Henderson. The forward finished the series with two goals and four assists, leading her team in points and goals on the season.</p>\n                <p>On the blue line, Muscedere took home her first award after recording four assists in Game 2. While in net, Secreto only allowed three goals throughout the series, finishing with a .948 save percentage.</p>\n                <p>All four lines seem to be on the same page for the Lions. Heading into its last home series of the season, Lindenwood seems to have the momentum a team needs heading into the end of the campaign, potentially posing a threat to the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Olympic recognition</p>\n                <p>Not only do the Nittany Lions have representatives in the Olympics, but Lindenwood also has a pair of defensemen representing its school as well. Both Lucie Quarto and Elina Zillox are in Milan, Italy, representing France in the games.</p>\n                <p>With players departing from both schools, several skaters who haven't seen much ice time all season have the opportunity to step up for their team.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | Penn State softball catcher position group battle",
    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s 2026 campaign is rapidly approaching, with a doubleheader against Missouri and Boston College on Friday. Yet, there\u2019s still some debate about who\u2019s going to be starting behind the plate for the Nittany Lions this season.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have four catchers on the roster between freshman Kirsten Finarelli, sophomore Macy Chamberlin and seniors Jordyn Jochims and Madison Seidel. While there are arguments for all players, the starting position will likely come down to Chamberlin or Seidel.</p>\n                <p>Chamberlin started immediately as a freshman for coach Clarisa Crowell in 2025 and delivered an impressive campaign until a midseason injury sidelined her for the rest of the season. The Wausen, Ohio, native started 20 of her 26 appearances, slashing an excellent .321 average, 17 hits and 11 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>The five-foot-eight catcher also flashed her glove with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage, including nine assists and 68 putouts. Before arriving at Happy Valley, Chamberlin ranked as the No. 22 overall prospect and No. 15 catcher in the 2024 class, so she holds massive upside and potential.</p>\n                <p>However, she faces steady competition as Seidel delivered the most impressive season of her collegiate career in 2025, reaching new single-season career-highs in every statistic. The Hilltown, Pennsylvania, native was the primary catcher after Chamberlin\u2019s injury and started 33 of her 43 appearances.</p>\n                <p>The senior finished last season with a steady .247 average, 23 hits and 15 RBI. Seidel was also impressive defensively, boasting a 1.000 fielding percentage, with 10 assists and 156 putouts, second most on the team.</p>\n                <p>As both Chamberlin and Seidel bat and throw right, their playing time likely won\u2019t be decided based on which opposing pitcher the Nittany Lions face. If Crowell wants a heavier bat in the lineup, I\u2019d lean towards starting Chamberlin.</p>\n                <p>While Chamberlin\u2019s sample size is smaller, she delivered a .528 slugging percentage and three home runs in that time span compared to Seidel\u2019s .409 slugging percentage and four home runs in more games.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, I could see Crowell starting Seidel because of her experience. With half of the pitching staff being freshmen, Crowell might want a steady presence behind the plate.</p>\n                <p>Another argument for starting Seidel would be letting her carry last season\u2019s momentum into 2026. If Crowell doesn\u2019t give Seidel many opportunities in the beginning of the season, her bat may go cold when she\u2019s inserted into the lineup.</p>\n                <p>Penn State also might want to ease Chamberlin back into playing full-time after her injury last season. It may help to have her not be the primary catcher right away, and instead get some reps and build confidence behind Seidel starting.</p>\n                <p>I ultimately see Crowell mostly splitting the starter role between the two catchers to start the season, and don\u2019t see there being a clear-cut primary catcher until Big Ten play begins in March. The loaded nonconference schedule to begin Penn State\u2019s campaign is the perfect opportunity for Crowell to swap around the catchers and ultimately decide who the starter is for the rest of the season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have doubleheaders on Friday and Saturday, so I expect Chamberlin and Seidel to split starts this weekend. However, Sunday\u2019s matchup against Auburn may give some insight into who might be the starter, as that\u2019s the only game of the day.</p>\n                <p>It will be interesting to see how the starting catcher position shapes up throughout the season, and either way, each player is talented, so Penn State should have no problems filling the role.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>\u201cYour worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing.\u201d Dostoevsky\u2019s words followed me through my head as I marveled at the marble and gold throughout the Vatican Museums on my way to the Sistine Chapel.</p>\n                <p>I carried the question with me, for how long have I, my generation and American society traded creativity, originality, wonder, depth and art, for noise, dopamine, immediacy and optimization?</p>\n                <p>The withering of self. We starve our artists and fund our corrupt corporations, rewarding nothing but the dull hum of endless scrolling. Aching for serenity that we sold for nothing. Betraying and destroying ourselves for our own atrophy and nothingness.</p>\n                <p>I tilted my head back and let my eyes rest on Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cCreation of Adam.\u201d Four years I thought, four years of devotion, discipline, of surrender to something greater than efficiency or profit, but for impact, legacy, and sheer awe. And now, centuries later, millions every year come to stand beneath his ceiling in silence, moved by his work.</p>\n                <p>I noticed the small distance between God\u2019s finger and Adam\u2019s, and remembered how I once filled sketchbooks of my recreation of this very movement. I tried to understand this space and how it separated man from divinity, and that maybe in that space there\u2019s a pause, and it\u2019s the very sin we have indulged that separates us. Rot. Decay. Superficiality.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps God and Adam never touch because sin is separation. And maybe this is ours, the slow betrayal of ourselves, the abandonment of what makes us alive, all for nothing at all.</p>\n                <p>Rome felt very intimate to me. I imagined Julius Caesar walking the same streets, and my time reciting monologues from Shakespeare\u2019s play. Maybe once his sandals struck the same stone. I thought of the Colosseum, and of the crowds who once gathered there, amused and ravenous for violence and the spectacle of humans being torn apart by wild animals.</p>\n                <p>I wonder when humanity decided suffering could become a form of leisure, and when gladiators were puppets, and death, a sport where lives were so easily disposable.</p>\n                <p>The only distance between ancient Romans and me was time. If we stood face to face, we would share no common language or meaning, just creatures from the same species.</p>\n                <p>And still this city gave us carbonara, amatriciana, and cacao e pepe. As much as Rome revealed to me, it reminded me I would miss this country, this version of myself and that I\u2019m already mourning the moments I\u2019m still inside of and grieving time that has not passed yet.</p>\n                <p>Back at Penn State, nearly every hour of my day is booked. I have always been fast-paced and busy by nature. In America, productivity is a virtue, and burnout serves as evidence. Here, I have no extracurriculars. No job.</p>\n                <p>Life here is slow, and what's the rush? I wake up earlier and rest. I can live with intention and explore my nature without expectations. I walk where I need to go without panicking about pace, and I possess more of the most valuable asset, which is time.</p>\n                <p>I stroll and hear music spill into the streets, opera singers, musicians playing cello. The beauty here is authentic; it doesn\u2019t run on a schedule or wait to be noticed, it just simply is.</p>\n                <p>I love it here, and I always knew I would.</p>\n                <p>Our real sin is that we\u2019re willing to forget what it feels like to be fully alive. To know tranquility, and choose speed anyway.</p>\n                <p>I am learning how rarely we allow ourselves this kind of presence. When I return, I hope I continue to channel the version of myself whose learning time isn\u2019t something to conquer, but something to live inside of.</p>\n                <p>MORE ABROAD COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "The Daily Collegian Softball Staff",
    "description": "<p>Penn State softball embarks on a new campaign after a record-breaking 2025 season, and the anticipation is high for a team with maximum opportunity to improve its standing in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how our staff sees the season going.</p>\n                <p>Gianna Dowling: 35-18</p>\n                <p>With lots of experienced talent on both sides of the ball, I believe Penn State will improve from 2025 and put itself in a position to make an NCAA Regional appearance for the second time in three years.</p>\n                <p>I think the Nittany Lions will go 2-3 in their opening weekend at the NFCA Leadoff Classic, falling to Missouri, BYU and Auburn. However, I think the blue and white will follow with an undefeated weekend at the Houston/HCU Invitational.</p>\n                <p>I have Penn State earning key non-conference wins over Houston, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Oregon State.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions open Big Ten play with a tough outing, taking a West Coast trip to face preseason No. 5 Oregon. I think the blue and white will leave Eugene winless, but will bounce back with a series win over Wisconsin in its Big Ten home opener.</p>\n                <p>The other three conference series that I see Penn State coming up short in are those against Northwestern, Ohio State and Nebraska, who, along with Oregon, all finished top-five in the Big Ten rankings in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, I think Penn State will finish conference play with a 13-11 record to put themselves in the middle of the standings and potentially make a run in the Big Ten Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Brielle Gari: 30-22</p>\n                <p>As softball season begins, the Nittany Lions look to improve. I believe in their improvement as well.</p>\n                <p>Having the first month of the season in nonconference tournaments, I believe it will give the blue and white wiggle room to figure out what works best for their squad. The do\u2019s and don\u2019ts early on in the season against smaller programs.</p>\n                <p>For the opening weekend, I would say Penn State goes 3-2. Falling to BYU and Boston College. As well as in the following weeks to UCF and Pitt. Facing off against Notre Dame in the SpaceU classic will be an interesting watch, as it will preview how the Nittany Lions fare against the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>In the final week of February, Penn State travels to Knoxville for the Tennessee Invitational. Facing off against the home team, the Lady Vols, this will be the Nittany Lions' test in potential postseason play against a powerhouse SEC program.</p>\n                <p>Going into the conference series matchups, I think the blue and white will split the series 50-50. Having success at Rutgers and in Champaign against Illinois. But having some difficulty on the road in Eugene, Oregon, or for the Big Ten regular season finale at home against Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>It's all about consistency that leads to improvement. Last year, the longest winning streak the Nittany Lions could hold onto was 5. Against conference opponents, consistency is key. Penn State must do well within the conference to make it to the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Beres: 36-17</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions head into the new campaign with hopes of reaching the NCAA Regionals for the second time in three seasons after missing the postseason in 2025. With a plethora of returners and key players back from injury, I see Penn State having a successful bounce-back season.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white will go 3-2 at the NFCA Leadoff Classic, winning favorable games over Boston College and Eastern Kentucky, while also pulling off a season opener win over Missouri.</p>\n                <p>I think Penn State rides the momentum and follows up that road trip by going undefeated at the Houston Invitational the next weekend. Following those games, I see the Nittany Lions going 4-1 at the SPACEU Classic, with their sole loss coming against UCF.</p>\n                <p>The Tennessee Invitational offers the blue and white its first big test of the season against preseason No. 4 Tennessee. I don\u2019t think Penn State pulls off the upset in either game, but the Nittany Lions will win their other three games in this invitational.</p>\n                <p>I have Penn State sweeping its first home series of the season before traveling cross country for a tough trip against Oregon State and preseason No. 5 Oregon. The Nittany Lions will start the road trip strong with a win over Oregon State, but will drop two of their three games against the Ducks in Eugene.</p>\n                <p>However, the squad will bounce back with a series win over Wisconsin in the Big Ten home opener. I think Penn State will pull off some upsets in conference play and position itself for a shot at a run in the Big Ten Tournament, finishing in the middle of the conference.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>On Oct. 28, 2025, a category five storm, Hurricane Melissa, hit the southern coast of Jamaica. The storm caused significant damage, and took a toll on the county\u2019s infrastructure, food production and housing.</p>\n                <p>It also took a toll on human-life, with at least 45 confirmed deaths caused by the storm, as of Dec. 2, 2025.</p>\n                <p>The storm was the largest to make landfall in Jamaica since Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and brought with it extreme rainfall and winds of up to 300 kilometers per hour. It hit Jamaica as a category five storm, before weakening and moving on to Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>\n                <p>Now, three months after the hurricane, restoration and aid efforts continue in Jamaica. Here, the Epsilon Gamma chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta (DST) sorority has teamed up with the Caribbean Student Association (CSA) to raise money for two families in affected areas. The goal is to raise around $2,000, according to CSA President Camren Boyogueno.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe idea is to give $1,000 to each family so that they would be able to take that and apply it to whatever they may need to, for help with restoration of either their homes or their resources,\u201d Boyogueno, a fourth-year studying neuropsychology, said.</p>\n                <p>The storm caused damage to homes and food supplies, as fishing was disrupted and agriculture was damaged, according to Boyogueno. The country\u2019s main airport in Montego Bay was also damaged, making transportation of both aid and people more difficult.</p>\n                <p>Boyogueno said the best way for the average student to help is to \u201cbe informed,\u201d and \u201cdonate if they feel inclined.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Antoinette Slaughter, a member of DST, said her family in Jamaica experienced the damages firsthand.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy family was directly affected regarding their housing, and there was damage in the house,\u201d Slaughter, a third-year studying nursing, said. \u201cObviously having your shelter damaged is extremely heartbreaking.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Slaughter said providing aid to some of these areas can be difficult, as many of them are rural, so \u201cto reach every single family is very difficult.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Chad-Daniel Salmon, an international student from Jamaica, also said the current infrastructure and geography of Jamaica can make aid difficult.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen you have especially extended rains, winds and stuff like that, and you're surrounded by roads, a lot of greenery, you might have a lot of trees blocking roads, you might have rivers overflowing into communities and you might have landslides where pieces of the road are just falling away,\u201d Salmon, a fifth-year studying mining engineering, said.</p>\n                <p>In addition to these short term impacts, other aspects of Jamaican life have been impacted, beyond just physical damage to roads and houses, according to Salmon. School disruptions are now a problem for many Jamaican students, as damage to their homes and schools has forced them to work to help repair.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEven though, yes, the island might technically be open for some people, their day-to-day is still not there,\u201d Salmon said.</p>\n                <p>Salmon said it\u2019s important to view hurricane effects in a different \u201cframing.\u201d While many organizations and aid-providers only consider short-term impacts like damage and loss of resources, he said it's important to also consider and take into account long-term issues.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think especially when it comes to news cycles, people love to show the videos of things like the roof missing, or the kid with no clothes or the kid who's looking at their home and it's not there anymore,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we also have to realize that these are people with whole lives and whole systems around them that they were using to survive, live and grow. In terms of when you cover storms, while it's important to look at the immediate damage, it's also important to think about how their life has been disrupted beyond just the damage that they are seeing in front of them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Trinity Benford, a member of DST, said it\u2019s important for organizations and people outside of Jamaica to be aware of what is happening, and willing to help.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like we hear a lot about things that happen and then we kind of forget about them, when in reality, people are living in these situations much longer than we hear about them,\u201d Benford, a third-year studying agriculture and biorenewable systems management, said. \u201cSo being able to gather non-profits that are actively working to help Jamaica, and being able to join efforts is something that we really wanted to help do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Those interested in contributing can do so <a href=\"https://psu.crowdchange.co/54326\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Keira Albert | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 14 Penn State is gearing up for a busy weekend against Saint Francis as it looks to take back some wins.</p>\n                <p>The first match of the series is the THON Match from Rec Hall at 7 p.m. Friday, but the Nittany Lions will hit the road for the next game, which will be played in DeGol Arena at 6 p.m. Friday.</p>\n                <p>After taking back-to-back losses against Hawai\u2019i last weekend, the blue and white have officially lost four straight games. Remaining at No. 14, the Nittany Lions have the chance to get some wins under their belt as they face the unranked Red Flash.</p>\n                <p>After a couple of tough matches, the odds could be in favor of Penn State.</p>\n                <p>These two are no strangers to one another. Last season, the teams met twice. And both times, the blue and white left the court with a 3-0 win. Similarly, the teams met twice in 2024, and Penn State left the victor both times.</p>\n                <p>Despite the four-game losing streak, it hasn\u2019t been all bad for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Currently, the Nittany Lions are No. 13 in the NCAA in blocks per set. With players like Owen Rose and Gaige Gabriel, both of whom rank in the top 50 in the stat, the blue and white definitely have the one-up in this area of play.</p>\n                <p>However, Saint Francis edges out Penn State in aces per set. Currently, the Red Flash are No. 23 in the NCAA in that very category, whereas the Nittany Lions trail far behind at No. 33.</p>\n                <p>Serving has seemed to be a consistent struggle for the blue and white. Last weekend, it only produced seven total service aces across two matches. More notably, it came up with a total of 29 service errors across both games.</p>\n                <p>While Gabriel has eight service aces so far, making him runner-up for the most of the squad, he leads the Nittany Lions in service errors with 29 on the year.</p>\n                <p>In order to have a different outcome than the last four matches, it is crucial that the quality of the blue and white\u2019s serves increase.</p>\n                <p>Defense has been strong for the blue and white. However, libero Ryan Merk has been consistently reliable. With 60 digs on the season, the redshirt senior ranks No. 22 in the NCAA in digs per set, currently averaging about 2.14 per set.</p>\n                <p>Merk isn\u2019t the only defensive talent for Penn State. Rose and Gabriel have a combined 56 blocks on the year. Sean Harvey follows close behind with 17 blocks this season.</p>\n                <p>Harvey has been having a strong season so far, and poses a threat to any team that he faces.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt sophomore leads the team in points with 108.5. But where he really makes himself known is in kills. With 94 on the year, he leads by almost double that of any of his other teammates.</p>\n                <p>But, Saint Francis has Brady Stump, who currently has 87 kills on the season. It\u2019s also important to note that the Red Flash have played one less game than the Nittany Lions so far.</p>\n                <p>Stump also leads Saint Francis in service aces with 12, which matches Penn State\u2019s leader, Rose.</p>\n                <p>The 4-4 Nittany Lions have a chance to get back on a good note this weekend. If history repeats itself, the 4-3 Red Flash could be tacking a couple of losses to their record this weekend.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | James Franklin\u2019s legacy as Black coach won\u2019t be lost in rocky end at Penn State",
    "author": "Avery Hill | Football Editor",
    "description": "<p>Entering the four-month mark since James Franklin was fired from Penn State, much of what\u2019s discussed among the Penn State fanbase is a sense of anger, disappointment and resentment.</p>\n                <p>At a shallow level, I get it. Twenty-one losses against AP top-10 teams, one Big Ten championship, a three-game losing streak to conclude his tenure coaching one of the biggest brands in college football. But what\u2019s often ignored is what he did do.</p>\n                <p>Among other successes, Franklin 's tenure at Penn State made him a modern-day pioneer in an area he holds near and dear to his heart \u2014 being a Black coach. That should never be forgotten.</p>\n                <p>At Penn State, Franklin won 104 games, a tie with Rip Engle as the second-most in program history. He also won four New Year\u2019s Six bowls and brought Penn State to a preseason ranking it hadn\u2019t seen since the late 1990s, an accomplishment even if it all unraveled after three games.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Franklin is the winningest African American head coach in FBS history. He\u2019s also the first and only African-American head coach to win a Big Ten title among other notable achievements.</p>\n                <p>But these accolades, and other on-field statistics only scratch the surface on what Franklin has done as a Black head coach.</p>\n                <p>The Langhorne, Pennsylvania, native long made it a goal of his to become the first Black head coach to win a national title. Of course to be able to do that on an individual level is important to Franklin, but the impact it may have on other coaches cements his legacy even more.</p>\n                <p>At the 2025 Orange Bowl media day, he noted the marker of 16 of 134 FBS coaches being Black \u2014 a number that has shifted a bit with 136 teams and the firing of coaches like Sherrone Moore.</p>\n                <p>It was a relative increase from the 6 of 127 FBS coaches when Franklin was the offensive coordinator at Kansas State under fellow Black head coach Ron Prince.</p>\n                <p>But that increase starts with coaches giving qualified minorities a chance. Franklin did so when he hired Charles Huff, who was on Franklin\u2019s staff at Vanderbilt but never landed a major, full-time position coaching job until he became Penn State\u2019s running backs coach in 2014. Huff went on to take three head coaching jobs.</p>\n                <p>Even for Huff\u2019s current stop, Memphis, Senior Vice President and Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Ed Scott said Franklin, along with Nick Saban, gave a firm recommendation for Huff.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat truly sets him apart is his character and integrity,\u201d Franklin said according to Memphis.</p>\n                <p>Then there\u2019s Terry Smith, who left a 2-10 Temple team where he coached the wide receivers, and was hired by Franklin as cornerbacks coach.</p>\n                <p>He may have never, and may never, get a shot to be a full-time head coach, but his time as an interim and his role as associate head coach made him one of the more respected, and highest-paid, assistants in the business.</p>\n                <p>That in its own right is an accomplishment in Black coaching history as according to a 2023 article from the Journal of Intercollegiate Sport, \u201cBlack coaches were disproportionately responsible for signing higher rated recruits than their White counterparts.\u201d Said responsibility comes from what\u2019s usually a position coach, a typically underpaid role.</p>\n                <p>And also with a look through the Lasch Building, the diversity, from all shapes of life and all positions, was evident; Franklin\u2019s a man who wants to give a chance to the most qualified.</p>\n                <p>But, that didn\u2019t mean it was all perfect.</p>\n                <p>As the big personality in Franklin fought a passionate, but critical fanbase, many seasons didn\u2019t go by without a \u201cFire Franklin!\u201d chant of some sorts.</p>\n                <p>Even in what I\u2019d consider a mishandling of his responsibilities as head man, walking off of the podium when asked for comment on the accusations of rape committed by his former players Jameial Lyons and Kaveion Keys, Franklin had his fair share of incidents that hurt his resume and perception.</p>\n                <p>But, said turn in perception, regardless of severity of the incident, is a microcosm of the fight Black coaches have fought for a long time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of us having to be perfect to get the job,\u201d legendary Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson Jr. said in 1998.</p>\n                <p>Black coaches have often been far behind the ladder when it comes to making the big step.</p>\n                <p>For Franklin, that started as a non-Division l collegiate player, and included a player/coach job in Denmark that he told Inside the Lions\u2019 Audrey Snyder he laid asphalt during.</p>\n                <p>It took Franklin 16 years to earn the big shot, though it\u2019s worth noting the sort of systematic privilege as a former quarterbacks coach that was promoted to offensive coordinator got him the opportunity even fast. He also got an 11-plus-year leash \u2014 a dream for many others.</p>\n                <p>But it didn\u2019t change his end at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The boos, curses and toxicity made Franklin a subject of pure resentment from a fanbase that, despite his successes, are likely rooted in a feeling of him not doing enough and not appreciating enough.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s a setback in his journey that, coincidentally, came in an NFL season that saw Mike Tomlin be fired and no Black coach be hired.</p>\n                <p>But it\u2019s also a message that Franklin, and many others, aren\u2019t done fighting. As Franklin makes a home in Blacksburg, Virginia, he continues to push for a fair shot for all.</p>\n                <p>But he isn\u2019t, and can\u2019t, start from ground zero. Despite the darkness \u2014 some to his fault and some to others\u2019 \u2014 created during his end in Happy Valley, Franklin\u2019s tenure is a marker for true success for a Black coach at the collegiate level.</p>\n                <p>It shouldn\u2019t be overshadowed.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLACK HISTORY MONTH STORIES</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Savon Huggins completed Matt Campbell\u2019s first staff at Penn State when he was hired as running backs coach in January.</p>\n                <p>Huggins and Campbell said they both felt they were a match for each other. Campbell said he could tell the respect Huggins had while holding the role at Boston College.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSays a lot about his character, who he is, what he's about, and it shined through in the interview process,\u201d Campbell said at the National Signing Day press conference on Wednesday. \u201cWe felt like we had a grand slam in terms of getting Savon to come on board and his family. They fit us culturally, and I certainly believe they fit the Penn State way of doing things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Huggins, who joined the Eagles in 2022, helped the running game go from 63.4 yards per game in his initial campaign, to 199.5 in the next.</p>\n                <p>This past year, Huggins guided running back Turbo Richard to 749 yards and nine touchdowns on 145 carries. Huggins said he had opportunities to leave, but wanted to find the \u201cright people\u201d before making a jump to a new school.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt had to make sense,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cIt's a family decision for me. I got three children, so family is very important to me. I want to be in an environment where it makes sense for my children, the school they go to, and the leadership in terms of the head coach, in terms of the staff, the continuity. I mean, those guys have been together for a long time. That says a lot about coach Campbell.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Campbell joked that he asked Huggins, a 2011 247Sports composite 5-star running back, if he had any more eligibility left to play. Huggins played at Rutgers, rushing for 842 yards and nine touchdowns across 32 games before missing his senior year due to injury. He finished out his college days at Northern Iowa.</p>\n                <p>Campbell pointed to Huggins\u2019 collegiate career as one of the reasons why he\u2019s excited to have him on staff, saying Huggins coaches because of what he learned through his collegiate journey.</p>\n                <p>Furthermore, Huggins said he feels himself and Campbell view the recruiting process the same.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking for high character young men, not only from a player standpoint, but from a coaching standpoint,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cIf he wants to make sure that these young men are being led, he has to know that the coaches that are leading them are the right people.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Huggins brings recruiting ties to the New Jersey area with him as he was a graduate of St. Peter\u2019s Prep. He said he\u2019s a \u201crelationship person,\u201d and it stuck out to him that he was asked by Campbell about his family before any football-related topics during the interview process.</p>\n                <p>Campbell showing he also cares about building relationships made Huggins feel they were \u201caligned\u201d with what each of them were looking for during the hiring process.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously we talked ball and talked about holistically from a recruiting standpoint, all the other things,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cBut he really wanted to know the person, and for me, that's heartwarming in this profession to find a leader in that position.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Junior Gracie Merkle returned to action after missing the last two games due to injury and made her presence known early.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions were resilient and fought hard for their first conference victory over Purdue in overtime 85-82.</p>\n                <p>The Mount Washington, Kentucky, native scored the first basket of the game off a missed jumper by Nyla McFadden. Penn State pressured Purdue early and forced a few turnovers and bad shots, but star guard Kiki Smith poured in some baskets and kept the Boilermakers close.</p>\n                <p>After a few minutes of no scoring by either team, star sophomore Kiyomi McMiller scored quickly off a short jumper and pulled the blue and white ahead 7-4. A few quick baskets by Purdue gave the Boilermakers the lead into the first timeout.</p>\n                <p>Purdue pressed the Lady Lions for the last four minutes of the first quarter and forced the blue and white into taking some uncomfortable shots. While the Lady Lions surrendered six turnovers in the opening frame, McMiller and Merkle combined for 15 of Penn State\u2019s 18 points and led Penn State into the second with an 18-15 lead.</p>\n                <p>Smith became hot again and poured in a quick five points in the first two minutes, which included a wide-open 3-pointer on the wing. The two squads exchanged buckets for a few minutes, but another lapse on defense left Purdue\u2019s Tara Daye wide open for a 3-pointer and the Boilermakers went ahead 26-24 at the 6:49 mark.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions took a 36-34 lead into halftime off an 11-4 run, led by six of McMiller\u2019s nine second-quarter points. Defensively, Purdue was kept on its feet after coach Carolyn Kieger switched looks between man and zone. The Boilermakers shot just 39% from the floor, including just 3-15 from behind the arc in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Merkle was the focal point in the blue and white\u2019s offense to start the second half, and she quickly drew the third foul on Purdue\u2019s Lana McCarthy. However, a few messy turnovers by Penn State allowed the Boilermakers to keep the score within a basket.</p>\n                <p>Kieger\u2019s squad forced a travel off a press at 4:42 in the third, but the Lady Lions immediately turned it over, and Daye made an easy layup down low. McMiller continued putting Penn State on her back and knocked down a five-foot jumper, and gave the blue and white its largest lead of the night at 46-41.</p>\n                <p>Purdue went on a quick 5-0 run to pull within one, but T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante found a wide-open Moriah Murray on the right wing for a 3-pointer to stop the bleeding. However, Penn State back-to-back steals by the Boilermakers on entrance passes to Merkle led to Kendall Puryear tying the game at 50 off a short jumper.</p>\n                <p>After a Merkle foul, Smith knocked down two free throws to give Purdue a 52-50 lead, roaring into the final frame. Turnovers haunted the Lady Lions in the third, as they surrendered a whopping seven giveaways compared to just one Purdue turnover.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State\u2019s two leading scorers held their own, the Lady Lions needed offense from another scorer to win their first conference game. Murray rose to the occasion and poured in two key 3-pointers for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>McMiller was contained in the second half by Purdue, but she drove downhill and flipped in a timely layup, giving Penn State a 64-59 lead with 4:25 left.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white stalled offensively, and the Boilermakers forced the Lady Lions\u2019 18th turnover of the contest. McCarthy\u2019s basket off the steal pulled Purdue back in front 65-64 at 2:43.</p>\n                <p>Just as she\u2019s done all season, McMiller was the offensive star down the stretch. She found Tea for a critical 3-pointer, then drove down on the next possession for another layup. McMiller\u2019s 10th basket gave Penn State a 71-67 lead with 55 seconds left.</p>\n                <p>Out of the Purdue timeout, Smith made just one of two free throws and then fouled McMiller on the other end. In the bonus, McMiller stepped up to the stripe with 27 seconds left with a chance of icing the first conference win for the Lady Lions. The Silver Spring, Maryland, native delivered two clutch free throws and gave Penn State a 73-68 lead.</p>\n                <p>Smith hit a timely 3-pointer out of the timeout, and McMiller was soon shooting free throws again with 15 seconds left. McMiller made the first, but missed the second, which set up a backbreaking 3-pointer by Nya Smith to tie the game at 74 with .4 seconds left.</p>\n                <p>After Merkle\u2019s miss from down low, Penn State entered overtime after some last-second heroics by Kiki and Nya. After a Purdue miss, McMiller drove and dished it out to the corner for a McFadden 3-pointer to put the Lady Lions up 77-74.</p>\n                <p>However, the Boilermakers punched right back after Murray committed a foul on Daye in the paint, who converted the and one to tie the game at 77 with 3:33 left.</p>\n                <p>After a stretch of minimal offense from both squads, fatigue set in; Penn State desperately needed a basket to break the tie. McMiller got doubled and tried forcing a pass to Merkle in the paint, but the ball was knocked away into the hands of Murray. Yet, Murray was wide open in the left corner, and she drained the 3-pointer, putting the Lady Lions up 81-78 with 36 seconds left.</p>\n                <p>McMiller made two clutch free throws with 24 seconds left to keep the lead 83-79, but Daye converted a critical and one to pull Purdue within one with 17 seconds. Viktoria Ranisavljevic converted two free throws and an empty Purdue possession on the other end gave Penn State its first conference win.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action against Michigan State at Rec Hall, Feb 7.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lexie Linderman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>D\u2019Anton Lynn had returned to the Lasch Building just once since he graduated from Penn State in 2012. As a defensive assistant for the Buffalo Bills, he came to Pro Day in 2015.</p>\n                <p>That stood until Matt Campbell came calling to offer Lynn the defensive coordinator position, a role he had just turned down the prior offseason. He took it, returning to Penn State facilities that look much different than they did 11 years ago.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like everything's a family decision at this point, and me and my wife just felt like we were more prepared this time around,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cAnd then the more I talked to coach Campbell on the phone, he really kind of reminded me of why I went to Penn State, just from what he was going to do with the culture here. So I was just excited to be on board.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lynn said it was still a difficult decision to pack everything up and move cross country, as his wife is from Los Angeles, where he and his family have spent the last three years. And he has three children under 3, complicating a big move even more.</p>\n                <p>Lynn also had a hard time leaving his players at USC that he\u2019s been with for the past two seasons, and Campbell said his defensive coordinator gave up some things \u201cfinancially\u201d to join his staff.</p>\n                <p>But the familiarity Lynn has with his new destination has helped mask some of that as guys like Director of Talent Acquisition Alan Zemaitis and Director of Player Development Jordan Hill have been around since Lynn\u2019s playing days.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust all the Penn State people that were here, like some people I played with, some people were on staff, but I just knew that I was familiar with the culture. I think that helped,\u201d Lynn said.</p>\n                <p>Lynn has received support from his former Penn State teammates as well since taking the job. He said he\u2019s been speaking with former roommate Matt McGloin the most, who lives \u201cright down the road\u201d and \u201cwill be out here a lot,\u201d according to Lynn.</p>\n                <p>The adjustment to actually coaching for the Nittany Lions, though, is still fresh for Lynn. He\u2019s been working on getting to know the staff and players but hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to do so with the coaches on the road recruiting the 2027 class.</p>\n                <p>Terry Smith has been a big help for Penn State\u2019s new defensive coordinator in that regard by telling him about players that don\u2019t have much on tape as Lynn works to nail down his scheme.</p>\n                <p>Smith and Lynn\u2019s previous relationship helped Campbell feel even better about the hire, and other trusted colleagues echoed positive sentiments about the former USC playcaller. His scheme and success as a defensive coordinator spoke for itself as well.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think the thing that I love about D\u2019Anton Lynn is his variability, his ability to have consistency,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd I think you see a confidence that his defense plays with. And you saw that at UCLA, you saw that at USC and the improvement that they were making during his time there. But you also saw the ability to structurally dictate and navigate the pace of the game at times.\u201d</p>\n                <p>What Lynn\u2019s not going to do, though, is bring his scheme from USC to Penn State and force the players into it. As work begins in a few weeks, Lynn will begin to implement his philosophy and make sure the on-field product is consistent each game come the end of August.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe want to really just build around what these guys do best,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cSo I try not to just be a system guy where, \u2018this is what we're going to do no matter what.\u2019 Let's really see what these guys do best. Let's build a scheme around that. And we just try to really emphasize it's more about how we play than as far as what we do. The scheme can change week to week, year to year, but as far as how we play, that has to be the same.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After Penn State\u2019s 26-12 victory against Nebraska, the Nittany Lions will hit the road and travel to Ann Arbor to take on Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Before this matchup Cael Sanderson met with the media to discuss a handful of topics.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he had to say.</p>\n                <p>Recapping Nebraska</p>\n                <p>The match between Nebraska was interesting with two Penn Staters giving points to the other team. Nebraska didn\u2019t really attack and was on defense for most of the match. Penn State has been preparing for that for a while.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019re obviously preparing and stuff, it's not anything new,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cAnytime you have a good wrestler or you play a good team, people are going to try to figure out how to beat you and sometimes that\u2019s the best shot.\u201d</p>\n                <p>During the match, Braeden Davis and Levi Haines were two wrestlers that let their emotions get the best of them. Davis gave the Cornhuskers another point while Haines let Christopher Minto start with a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou want discipline, it\u2019s obviously a success principle, something that you got to have in all aspects of wrestling and your lifestyle,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWhen actions are not what we want them to be I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a good thing \u2026 anything that happens as a head coach, that\u2019s on me. We\u2019ll learn.</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze and Rocco Welsh</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze has gone underlooked, Sanderson said. He currently ranks at No. 4 at 133 pounds and has an undefeated 16-0 record. Blaze has multiple ranked wins and continues to look like a potential national championship contender.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s just a tremendous competitor. He stays in such good position as he\u2019s competing,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI think he\u2019s maybe a little under the radar if that\u2019s even possible because he\u2019s really really good. I mean I don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh had a slow start to the season, but has been on a roll after defeating the then-No. 1 wrestler in Angelo Ferrari from Iowa. In a tough 184 pound weight class, Welsh now finds himself at the top.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s a student of the game. He\u2019s a great competitor and I think he\u2019s getting more and more comfortable like he knows that this is where he belongs,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Hitting the road</p>\n                <p>Penn State hits the road to Ann Arbor to face the Wolverines. This will be a homecoming for two Nittany Lions as Braeden Davis and Josh Barr are Michigan natives, who will likely have their family and friends at the match.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson seemed excited to hit the road and likes how it could affect his team for the long run as the season continues.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think being on the road. It\u2019s almost easier because you\u2019re in a hotel, you\u2019re isolated. It\u2019s fun to go wrestling in other people\u2019s arenas,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe\u2019re just happy to compete.\u201d</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Eight years ago, Maddie Rooney made a stick save against Canada\u2019s Meghan Agosta in the sixth round of the shootout in the Gold Medal Game, giving the United States its first win in the event since 1998. In her fourth time representing her country at the Olympics, Hillary Knight finally earned a taste of gold.</p>\n                <p>In 2022, Team Canada played spoiler and prevented the United States from winning in back-to-back Olympic Games. Marie-Philip Poulin put the Canadians up 3-0 in the second period and never looked back.</p>\n                <p>Now, after over 1,400 days, Knight is back for the next time to represent the United States at the Olympics for the final time in her career. She\u2019ll travel to Italy with a few new teammates, one being Penn State\u2019s captain, Tessa Janecke.</p>\n                <p>Janecke looks to capture the third gold medal of her career, the first at the Olympic level. The Orangeville, Illinois, native previously won two gold medals at the IIHF World Championship, the second coming after her medal-clinching \u201cgolden goal.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Preliminary round</p>\n                <p>This year, the United States begins its chase for gold in Milano-Cortina in a group similar to the one it faced in 2022: Canada, Finland, Switzerland and now Czechia, who were placed in Group B at the Winter Games in Beijing.</p>\n                <p>During the last Winter Games, the Americans went 3-1 in the preliminary round with their lone loss coming from the Canadians.</p>\n                <p>This year, Janecke and Team USA will kick off this round of pool play on Thursday at 10:40 a.m. EST against Czechia. Competing in the event for the first time in history four years ago, the Czechs split their four games in the preliminary round before falling 4-1 to the United States in the quarterfinals after a three-goal period from the red, white and blue.</p>\n                <p>The next two games will come against Finland on Saturday and Switzerland on Monday. In 2022, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Alex Carpenter each scored twice in a 5-2 win over the Fins, and Alex Cavallini recorded a 12-save shutout in an 8-0 win over Switzerland.</p>\n                <p>The preliminary round concludes on Feb. 10, a date Americans and Canadians have circled on their calendars, when the two play each other.</p>\n                <p>Team USA hasn\u2019t beaten Team Canada in a preliminary round in any of the last three Winter Games. Going back to the 2014 Games in Sochi, the United States is 1-5 against its neighbors from the north, its lone win coming in the 2018 Gold Medal Game.</p>\n                <p>Quarterfinal round</p>\n                <p>From this round forward, everything is left up to seeding. Team USA has an advantage being in Group A, a group containing teams that are referred to as the top in the world. In 2022, they finished second in the group behind Canada with nine points, but would have advanced regardless.</p>\n                <p>Looking at Group B, Sweden is projected to be one of the top finishers, earning it the sixth seed.</p>\n                <p>Assuming the United States falls to Team Canada again in pool play, they would finish as the No. 2 seed and would play the No. 7 seed. That seed could be filled by Japan, who appropriately enough are ranked seventh in the IIHF rankings.</p>\n                <p>Should the host Italy pull off some upsets in the preliminary round, it could also sneak into the No. 7 seed. That would set up a game for Penn State fans to watch as the Nittany Lions' captain Janecke would face teammate Matilde Fantin.</p>\n                <p>Semifinal round</p>\n                <p>The United States has reached the semifinal round in every Olympic appearance. All but once have the Americans advanced to the Gold Medal Game. Their lone loss in this round was in 2006, when Sweden won in a shootout, shocking the nation.</p>\n                <p>In each of the last two Winter Olympics, the United States has faced Finland in the semifinals. Rooney recorded a 14-save shutout in a 5-0 win in 2018, and Knight recorded two points in a 4-1 win in 2022.</p>\n                <p>Gold Medal Game</p>\n                <p>Despite the six games needed to play to reach this point, it\u2019s one that most think the Americans won\u2019t have an issue facing. Besides the off-year that was 2006, the United States has reached the Gold Medal Game at each Winter Olympics, including 1998 when it captured the gold in the first year women\u2019s hockey became an event.</p>\n                <p>Its foe in all of those games has also been the same: Team Canada. As expected, the Canadians have a stacked roster that features Poulin, Brianna Jenner and Julia Gosling \u2014 who each rank top-10 in points in the PWHL \u2014 and Jocelyne Larocque, who has captured two Olympic gold medals already.</p>\n                <p>If the United States can pull off the upset just as it did in 2022, it would give Janecke her first Olympic gold medal and make her the first player in program history to win a spot on the highest stand of the podium.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",

Tipoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m.</p>\n                <p>When the Wolverines visited Happy Valley back on Jan. 6, the blue and white nearly upset May\u2019s squad.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took it down to the last possession after overcoming a 15-point deficit, but failed to knock down a game-tying or winning shot, and lost 72-74.</p>\n                <p>Though the blue and white faithful were just a matter of seconds away from storming the court, the Nittany Lions won\u2019t have the legion of blue to back them this time around when they head into one of the most difficult places to play in the country: the Crisler Center in Ann Arbor.</p>\n                <p>Michigan\u2019s lone loss on the year came at the hands of Wisconsin just four days after the Wolverines took down the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Since that loss, the maize and blue have won six-straight, including key victories over then-ranked No. 5 Nebraska and in-state rival No. 7 Michigan State in the past week.</p>\n                <p>Penn State improved to 10-12 on the season after snapping an eight-game losing streak and picking up its first conference win against Minnesota on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions last won in the Crisler Center in Jan. of 2020, in Juwan Howard\u2019s first season at the reins.

    "author": "Lexie Linderman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When Matt Campbell took the podium in Beaver Stadium for the first time, there were just two signees in the 2026 class on board for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>A little less than two months later, Campbell has bumped that number up to 15 with a mix of former Iowa State signees and a few others as he works to rebuild a roster that lost 50 players to the transfer portal.</p>\n                <p>Campbell spoke with the media for the first time since his introductory press conference on Wednesday for National Signing Day, touching on the craziness of the last two months, Penn State\u2019s new quarterback and more.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what the Nittany Lions\u2019 first-year coach had to say.</p>\n                <p>The last two months</p>\n                <p>Campbell was tasked with navigating the transfer portal, adjusting to a new home, recruiting and retaining current Penn State players all in just two months. He\u2019s taken over jobs before at Toledo and Iowa State, but the portal was vastly different in 2016 when he became the Cyclones\u2019 head coach.</p>\n                <p>That change made the last two months a \u201cwhirlwind\u201d for Campbell, so he relied on what he learned the last 10 years at Iowa State to get him and his staff through.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe landscape that we're in is so completely different. And that's not a positive or a negative, it's just different,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd I think what Iowa State taught me is you have to go in and you have to figure out what is going on, what are the positives, what are the areas of growth, and how do you make the right moves moving forward? And I think that's what I learned from my Iowa State experience \u2014 that you don't have all the answers.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While those were the similarities from 2016 to 2026 for Campbell, he expressed how the differences, such as the transfer portal, were difficult. Still, his vision for Penn State helped guide him through.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think the difference, obviously, was probably the player acquisition piece,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHow do you build a current team to move forward? How do you build a foundation? And again, there's probably some areas that you wish you didn't have to deal with, and then there's probably some other areas you're really grateful that you had the ability to deal with.\u201d</p>\n                <p>New coordinators</p>\n                <p>Campbell elected to bring in Taylor Mouser from Iowa State to be the Nittany Lions\u2019 next offensive coordinator, a position where fans are searching for success after three seasons of subpar offensive play.</p>\n                <p>Mouser only has two seasons of offensive coordinator experience, but Campbell felt comfortable having him make the jump to the Nittany Lions, as he considers Mouser \u201cone of the up-and-coming bright minds in college football.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think no matter who we played, where we played, what it played, I think we really gave ourselves a great opportunity to have great success offensively,\u201d Campbell said. You've watched him really kind of mature in terms of who he's become as a playcaller, a great leader of people. Again, when you put the coordinator title to any of these coaches, I think you're expecting a gentleman and somebody that's got unbelievable leadership ability in the ability to align and unify a group, and Taylor's done a great job of that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As for the defensive coordinator spot, Campbell spoke with Jon Heacock, his defensive coordinator at Iowa State, after the last game of the 2025 season. There, Heacock told him he might be done coaching football.</p>\n                <p>Fast forward to December, and Campbell tried to see if Heacock wanted to continue coaching for him, but the long-time defensive coordinator decided it was time to retire. So Campbell went to the drawing board, zeroing in on USC\u2019s D\u2019Anton Lynn.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe first name that we came up with was coach Lynn,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cFrom talking to some people that I have great respect for even in house, of some of our own coaches that had come with me, just felt like that was the number one target for the style of defense we wanted to play. For somebody that understood Penn State football, that wanted to be here, that wanted to be a part of this program, that had a passion for Penn State. I felt like that was critical.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rocco Becht</p>\n                <p>Another piece that Campbell worked to keep with him was quarterback Rocco Becht. Campbell said he feels as though a quarterback and head coach need to be \u201ctied at the hip\u201d in today\u2019s era of college football, and he and Becht have that relationship already.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI believe Penn State football is integrity, character, class, excellence, grit. He embodies every one of those traits,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd so to me, I just felt like that was such a critical opportunity for him to finish his career with us, and the start of Penn State football, to get somebody that I truly believe embodies what the excellence of this football program stands for, both on and off the field.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Becht is coming off a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder, an injury he picked up with a few weeks left in the regular season. Campbell said Becht had to get \u201cshot\u201d up every Tuesday and Wednesday just so he could practice.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s that toughness that Campbell didn\u2019t want to leave behind.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's tough and as competitive as any football player I've been around,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cSo I think he brings those traits with him. And again, really proud of what he's about and really excited for him to continue to lead and grow within our football program.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Big Ten continued to display over the past week why it\u2019s the pinnacle of sport at this level. Whether it be from thrilling performances, unpredictable volatility or just the hierarchical order that\u2019s been tested all year long, the conference\u2019s had it all on the hardwood in its recent games.</p>\n                <p>With that being said, let\u2019s glance at the most important moments in the Big Ten, both good and bad.</p>\n                <p>Conference classics</p>\n                <p>The last week of Big Ten basketball may have contained some of the best play it\u2019ll have all year.</p>\n                <p>From Penn State\u2019s Kayden Mingo hucking up a program-needed buzzer-beater that\u2019ll get covered later in this article, to a clash of the basketball version of the Battle of the Paul Bunyan Trophy, there\u2019s no shortage of memorable moments around the conference.</p>\n                <p>That rivalry clash actually was one of the week's lesser climactic moments, as top-10-ranked Michigan State and Michigan looked like one of the best games of the season, but instead the Wolverines cruised to a 12-point victory in East Lansing.</p>\n                <p>Illinois put up two memorable outings, the first of which came in late Jan. 24 when Keaton Wagler contributed a single-game Big Ten high of 46 points in an upset over Purdue.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Illini weren\u2019t done there in showing why the Midwest isn\u2019t just flyover states, but displays of hooping excellence, when they traveled to Nebraska and enacted another road upset, as Wagler this time contributed 28 points.</p>\n                <p>Another Midwest school contributed a classic, though this time on the west: Indiana traveled to UCLA for a one-point double-overtime thriller, decided at the free throw line. Five scorers reached 20 or more points, and five also fouled out, in a game that had it all.</p>\n                <p>Phony Trojey</p>\n                <p>USC basketball sports one of the best overall records in the Big Ten at 16-6, but when you start diving further, the Trojans begin to look like paper tigers. All six losses came in conference play, and advanced metrics like KenPom and Evan Miyakawa\u2019s Bayesian metrics only place USC in the middle of the pack, below teams with less attractive records.</p>\n                <p>Over the past week of play, that\u2019s only been reinforced, as USC strengthened its streak of tightly decided contests. The Trojans haven\u2019t had a game decided by more than ten points since a Jan. 13 win over Maryland, a bottom-of-the-conference competitor.</p>\n                <p>USC's last four games resulted in a mixed record: it faced top-half teams Wisconsin and Iowa and bottom-half teams Rutgers and Northwestern. USC only defeated the Badgers and the Scarlet Knights from that stretch, with one possession deciding both games.</p>\n                <p>War is over</p>\n                <p>Inside the Big Ten, glances at the little guys matter just as much as those dominating the standings, and in a clash with 17th seed tournament implications, bottom dwellers Penn State and Northwestern faced off.</p>\n                <p>The Wildcats secured their first home conference win, to the Nittany Lions' dismay, who were embarrassed in the contest 94-73, when it looked like they had an opportunity to put up a fight entering the game.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white eventually made good on its effort to reverse a string of losses when it earned its first Big Ten win at the buzzer against Minnesota in a Kayden Mingo move that had as many spins, rotations and folds as a laundromat.</p>\n                <p>It may not be the cleanest way to earn its first conference win, but it\u2019s needed in Happy Valley, and it's reasonable to just let them have this one. Before this win, the Nittany Lions men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams started 0-21 in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>Penn State joins Oregon and Maryland, the latter of whom thumped the Nits in January, as the teams with only one Big Ten win. The Ducks host the blue and white on Feb. 14 for a West Coast road trip, after which the Nittany Lions also visit Washington.</p>\n                <p>Sure, the top of the conference looks stacked more than ever, and there are real contenders for national honors of that batch.

    "description": "<p>While at home over winter break, I made a miraculous discovery: my old MP3 player, stuffed to the brim with the emo(ish) music I loved in 2016 as an oddball preteen.</p>\n                <p>Nostalgic joy aside, one of the main things I got excited about was something I hadn\u2019t had the privilege of doing in years: listening to music without my phone or laptop \u2014 music I wasn\u2019t paying $12.99 a month to listen to without ads, might I add!</p>\n                <p>I\u2019ve been meaning to reduce my screentime for a while now. Too much screen time for adults can impact your eyes, brain matter and mental health, according to Stanford Lifestyle Medicine.</p>\n                <p>For those of you who are still teenagers, you aren\u2019t off the hook. The CDC says all that (and more!) about you.</p>\n                <p>And that\u2019s just screens alone, without all the nasty social media stuff at play.</p>\n                <p>I won\u2019t argue that there\u2019s no such thing as good screen time. Reading, writing or being otherwise creative, talking to friends or even just doing something mindless for a bit to unwind can be beneficial.</p>\n                <p>However, I\u2019d argue that\u2019s not what the majority of us are doing. Cue the image of myself at 2 a.m., bleary-eyed, hair in a terrible bun, hunched over an assignment or the social media app of my choosing.</p>\n                <p>Far from educational, I\u2019d argue. And of course, aside from the information I just cited, there\u2019s anecdotal (trust me, bro) evidence that it rots your brain.</p>\n                <p>This is a strong opinion for this column, but I\u2019ll say it anyway: being chronically online makes you (royal) insufferable. You end up not only with a poor attention span, but with a poor understanding of how the real world works.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019ve made fun of this before, but no, that girl you don\u2019t like isn\u2019t an \u201cenergy vampire\u201d or a \u201ccovert female vulnerable narcissist\u201d with \u201cavoidant tendencies\u201d that you need to establish \u201cboundaries\u201d with and \u201ccleanse your energy\u201d from.</p>\n                <p>Do you KNOW what those words mean? WHY are you putting them together? You sound AI-generated\u2014</p>\n                <p>Deep breaths.</p>\n                <p>There are, of course, plenty of alternatives to the doomscroll (either through social media or, worse, through Canvas), but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all heard them ad nauseam.</p>\n                <p>Despite me encouraging myself and others to go offline, I recognize that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to do. Social pressure to be \u201cin the know\u201d aside, it\u2019s not exactly like we live in uneventful times.</p>\n                <p>Even besides that, every basic necessity has ended up on some sort of screen.</p>\n                <p>I mean, Penn State is pushing mobile student IDs, making it so students have to choose between the essentially-required-on-campus mobile id+, or the</p>\n                <p>required-to-prove-you\u2019re-a-student-everywhere-else physical id+. Very streamlined, you see.</p>\n                <p>We seemingly live in a world where we\u2019re required to have a smartphone with us at all times, and as such, people expect to have access to us \u2026 at all times.</p>\n                <p>Doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re in class, the shower, an important meeting or your own personal zone, every notification requires an instant response. Your parents/boss/friend/professor won\u2019t wait forever (more than an hour tops).</p>\n                <p>Speaking of, I can\u2019t deny that having to do assignments entirely online significantly ups my screen time.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m not saying that professors shouldn\u2019t use Canvas, as I for one like being able to check schedules, syllabi and grades. However, I find that in my classes where tech use isn\u2019t required, I\u2019m not only more focused but less stressed.</p>\n                <p>Despite an earlier deadline seeming more difficult, I know I\u2019m not alone when I say that knowing my professor has my essay or my quiz by the end of class is a lot less nerve-wracking than fighting to get it in by 11:59 p.m. Nor do I have to worry about some hidden reading or assignment I missed on Canvas, a message I didn\u2019t get or my grade tanking with no explanation until next class (or a frantic email).</p>\n                <p>One might even argue that because students can now access assignments at any time, some course workloads might have gotten heavier \u2014 and that the same might be said about work. But hey, all alleged.</p>\n                <p>All in all, I can\u2019t help but notice we\u2019ve become accustomed to instant gratification from our tech, and that we\u2019ve begun to expect that same gratification from people. And who wants to turn off their phone if it\u2019ll blow up once they turn it back on again?</p>\n                <p>So, I don\u2019t exactly blame you for not being as analog as you might want. Not like you can use this week\u2019s internet therapy speak to \u201cset a boundary\u201d with your boss or professor \u2014 no matter how refreshing it\u2019d be to call some of them \u201cenergy vampires.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sorry Dr. Professional. Have you considered you might be a narcissist? Yeesh.</p>\n                <p>In your lower screentime journey (if you\u2019re starting at all), keep it small. Trade Spotify for an MP3 and mute your unimportant notifications. Tell your friends you\u2019ll be offline more often and allocate the time in your day for it.</p>\n                <p>Maybe one day, we can put our collective foot down with everyone who expects things from us. But for now, baby steps.</p>\n                <p>Oh, and delete TikTok, I swear to god-</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Alli Satterfield | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Athleisure has become a part of many people\u2019s everyday wardrobe in recent years, which has provided comfort and ease while getting dressed. But, it\u2019s left us with the question: what do we wear when working out? Since athleisure has taken over our day-to-day style, what\u2019s left for the gym?</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m someone who loves working out. I\u2019ll try anything once, but I love running, weight-lifting and yoga, and I haven\u2019t fallen victim to every single athletic-fashion trend. These are some of my staple pieces for a great workout.</p>\n                <p>Hoka</p>\n                <p>I am the proud owner of two pairs of Hoka Arahis. I have a bright blue and purple pair of Hoka Arahi 7s and a black and white pair of Hoka Arahi 8s. They are some of the lightest and comfiest shoes that have ever graced my feet, and as someone with a high arch, I can\u2019t recommend them enough in terms of support.</p>\n                <p>They are great running shoes, and the later model has more curvature in the design of the outsole, which helps to cradle my feet and add to the rock in my stride. I love running outside in them because I feel like they push me to be so much faster.</p>\n                <p>The earlier model Arahi 7s are also insanely comfortable, but they have less of a dramatic curve in the shoe. I love wearing them on the treadmill and on more dynamic footing, like trails and cobblestone, because the flatter nature of the shoe helps me connect to the ground and feel secure.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019ve never tried Red Bull, but I promise that my Hokas give me wings.</p>\n                <p>Aerie flare leggings</p>\n                <p>Although not for running, Aerie\u2019s flared leggings are some of the best pants I have ever put on my body. They are very soft, but they are also able to wick sweat extremely well, and I\u2019ve found it\u2019s difficult to find that combination in a lot of workout clothing.</p>\n                <p>I also love the cross-over design on the waist. It looks incredibly flattering, but it also feels great. The V-shaped design allows for more airflow and comfort, while also framing features like a high-waisted legging would.</p>\n                <p>Old Navy Activewear</p>\n                <p>Brands like Hoka, Aerie and Lululemon can get a little pricey after a while, and if you\u2019re anything like me, you work out a lot and wear down your gym clothes quickly. You don\u2019t want to be spending a fortune on clothes that get disgusting in a matter of months. That\u2019s why I love Old Navy\u2019s activewear.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not crazily expensive in the way other brands are. But, it offers similar designs, materials and technologies that deliver exactly what you want in your workout clothes. Plus, it seems to me Old Navy is almost always running some kind of buy-one-get-one or discount promotion that makes their brand even more appealing.</p>\n                <p>At this point, I have probably gone through 10 pairs of shorts and five pairs of leggings from Old Navy, and when I make my current pairs threadbare, I will be a return customer.</p>\n                <p>Asics quick lyte socks</p>\n                <p>As previously mentioned, I\u2019m a runner, and I\u2019m one who\u2019s very picky about the way her socks feel. I don\u2019t like them too thick because, frankly, I don\u2019t want sweaty toes. I also have a wide foot, so I want the kind of stretch and compression that can come from thicker material blends.</p>\n                <p>These Asics socks are perfect.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019ve now purchased multiple packages of them, and wear them any time I put any kind of athletic shoe on my feet. They wick sweat well, compress my feet and reduce soreness and stretch enough to get around my wide, wide foot. They also fit very well inside my Hokas and, when my feet start to swell from running, they don\u2019t make the shoe feel too tight.</p>\n                <p>The free T-shirt you got from a volunteer event</p>\n                <p>Matching sets are not necessarily my thing. I love an oversized tee to exercise in. They make me feel so comfortable and, even if I\u2019m having a low body-confidence day, I know that my large tee will make me feel my best.</p>\n                <p>Another plus is that they\u2019re free. Athleisure can get pretty expensive pretty quickly, and if you\u2019re shopping for a new gym wardrobe because of a New Year\u2019s Resolution or new goal to work out more, you might not want to buy everything at once and that\u2019s okay. Use your old pajamas, volunteer and 5k T-shirts. I promise you\u2019ll feel like a superstar.</p>\n                <p>Enjoy your workout!</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Anticipation is building ahead of Penn State\u2019s 2026 season, kicking off this weekend.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are led this year by new coach Kayla Treanor, who has lofty expectations for her team every time they step on the field.</p>\n                <p>In 1-on-1 interviews with Treanor and players, all spoke of their championship mindset and desire to win the NCAA tournament this year.</p>\n                <p>While Treanor doesn\u2019t have a championship under her belt as a head coach or athlete, she\u2019s spent significant time playing and coaching on the biggest stage. Treanor participated in six Championship Weekends from 2013 to 2024 and, as the associate head coach, won the 2021 NCAA Championship with Boston College.</p>\n                <p>Despite this success, how will Penn State\u2019s first season under Treanor go? Players, coaches, and some fans believe this year will be a championship season, but is that possible in her first year at the helm?</p>\n                <p>I think there are two logical outcomes for the Nittany Lions\u2019 season \u2014 a good season or a great season. Penn State is destined for greatness under Treanor, but it\u2019s just a matter of how long until the blue and white reach its full potential.</p>\n                <p>Treanor has the potential to earn a trip to the national championship game this year with a solid group of returners and new faces. Erika Ho led the team with 46 goals last year, Sydney Manning earned Big Ten Freshman of the Year honors as the starting goalie in 2024 and Lauren Tinson and Maggie Driver both returned for their senior year on defense.</p>\n                <p>However, a lot needs to go right for the Nittany Lions to win it all in Year 1. Treanor\u2019s team is under completely new leadership besides Director of Operations Katie Haus, and there\u2019s a lot of chemistry that needs to be formed to win on the highest level.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions play in a loaded conference with three teams in the IWLCA Coach\u2019s Poll top-10 and another school slotting in at No. 15.</p>\n                <p>Between the tough conference matchups and a nonconference battle with No. 6 Princeton, Treanor\u2019s squad has a schedule built for champions. If they can capitalize on those high-ranking matchups, the Nittany Lions could earn a spot in championship weekend.</p>\n                <p>However, that great season may be less of a reality in her first year, Penn State is still capable of a good season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions should win all, if not almost all of their nonconference games. When conference play rolls around, an upset or two could very well happen in Happy Valley, especially when Panzer Stadium is rocking.</p>\n                <p>With 12-13 wins on the year and at least one win in the Big Ten tournament, the blue and white should find itself in the NCAA tournament. From there, it can likely win a game or two.</p>\n                <p>While the Nittany Lions will likely fall short of their national championship aspirations, I believe the Nittany Lions will make the tournament but win only a game or two.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Avery Pelletier I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>With love in the air, red and pink all around and hearts all over, the feeling of Valentine\u2019s Day is here in State College. To match the energy of Penn State students in February, Dunkin\u2019 released their annual Valentine\u2019s menu for the 2026 season.</p>\n                <p>With the release of seven limited time drinks and two donuts, I had the chance to test out the new flavor combinations to see if they made me fall in love with Dunkin\u2019.</p>\n                <p>Heart Eyes Daydream Refresher</p>\n                <p>With its flavors of strawberry and dragon fruit combined with blueberry syrup, the base of the Heart Eyes Daydream Refresher was sweet and reminded me of summertime. With their signature sweet cold foam, the mix of the sweet refresher and the milky add-in on top blended together perfectly to make a fruity yet creamy drink.</p>\n                <p>The strawberry base of this drink was by far what came through the most out of the fruit flavors to the point where I wouldn\u2019t know there was blueberry syrup without a label.</p>\n                <p>While the overall flavor was pretty good, it was slightly too sweet for personal preference and would not be a drink I could order larger than a small.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 7/10</p>\n                <p>Chocolate Covered Strawberry Daydream Refresher</p>\n                <p>Similar to the previous drink, this refresher has a strawberry dragonfruit base, but what makes it unique is the rich, chocolate cold foam on top. This drink\u2019s flavor profile has a good balance of both the bitterness of the chocolate and the sweetness of the strawberry flavor.</p>\n                <p>Like its name says, this drink\u2019s flavor tastes like the classic Valentine's treat, chocolate covered strawberries, and was overall my favorite drink. While on the sweeter side, this flavor truly embodies the flavors many associate with this time of year.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Toxic Ex-Presso Cloud Latte</p>\n                <p>The Toxic Ex-Presso Cloud Latte not only had the most creative name out of the menu, but also the most typical coffee flavor.</p>\n                <p>The taste of the bitter espresso combined with mocha syrup and the velvety chocolate cold foam, at first taste, this latte was very enjoyable. The two types of chocolate flavors were not overpowering the coffee, but brought out the richness of the espresso.</p>\n                <p>However, the aftertaste of the raspberry syrup added in this drink was where the flavors fell short. The strong coffee taste that chocolate brings out in espresso did not blend but clashed with the raspberry aftertaste.</p>\n                <p>While I liked it at first, the clash of the fruity and coffee flavors led me to not enjoy this drink as I drank more of it.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 5/10</p>\n                <p>Blush Spritz Refresher</p>\n                <p>Continuing with the strawberry pattern, this strawberry dragonfruit refresher was similar to the others, but what made it stand out was the addition of sparkling water to the base that led to a fun spin on the traditional Dunkin\u2019 refresher.</p>\n                <p>Since the others had sweet cold foam to balance the sweetness of the fruit flavor, the \u201cBlush Spritz Refresher\u201d was a bit too sweet and tasted a lot like drinking a strawberry lollipop. The flavor may have been good but I could not see myself drinking more than a few sips.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 4/10</p>\n                <p>Sweet On You Cloud Latte</p>\n                <p>The name of this latte may have been very clever, but this was my personal least favorite of the seven drinks.</p>\n                <p>Even though the espresso complemented the caramel and sweet cold foam in the drink, the coconut syrup completely overpowered the other flavors. Even though I do not love coconut, I think if there was less syrup, it could have complimented the other flavors instead of tasting like drinking the syrup plain.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 1/10</p>\n                <p>Buff Chai</p>\n                <p>Usually I am not a huge fan of chai drinks, but this was an exception. It was enjoyable and the biggest surprise of all seven drinks.</p>\n                <p>With its strong spice flavors, there was no mistaking this drink for any of the others. However, the spices combined with the rich protein milk \u2014 the only drink to have it \u2014 created a flavorful yet filling drink that kept me sipping.</p>\n                <p>Not only were the spices unexpectedly delightful, the protein in this drink added an overall boost.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 7/10</p>\n                <p>The Perfect Matcha</p>\n                <p>While I wanted to believe the name of this drink, I feel as though this matcha did not live up to the title of being \u201cperfect.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The base of this drink is a standard matcha green tea with milk mixed in, and the sweet cold foam mixed on top makes the consistency of this drink overall thick and fluffy.</p>\n                <p>The taste of this drink however was where it fell flat. Not only did it have less Valentine\u2019s spirit than other options, the matcha flavor was very strong and could have benefited from added sweetener.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 4/10</p>\n                <p>The Donuts</p>\n                <p>I originally anticipated a drink to be my favorite menu item, but the special donuts were the highlight of it all.

    "title": "\u2018A winner before anything\u2019 | Penn State star Kayden Mingo\u2019s winning mindset started at young age",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Kayden Mingo grew up playing basketball in his backyard while getting coached by his father, who made it a priority to instill a winning mentality into his son.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I was younger, that's the one thing my dad always implemented, whether it was football, basketball or baseball,\u201d Mingo said in October. \u201cThat's just what my dad always told me, the most important thing is winning the game before anything. That's what I'm trying to do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Now, Mingo is the starting point guard for Penn State during his freshman year, making a game-winning basket in a 77-75 victory over Minnesota on Sunday. He\u2019s the Nittany Lions\u2019 highest-rated recruit in program history, and even though the team is 10-12 this season, that win-first mindset still flashes in his play.</p>\n                <p>Mingo\u2019s known to be mature beyond his years within the program, always looking to improve and taking it upon himself to accomplish that. He had 12 second-half points in a close contest against the Golden Gophers after having just two first-half points.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades said he called Mingo during the team\u2019s day off on Monday and asked if he had ever made a game-winning shot like his layup versus Minnesota before. Mingo said \u201cnot like that\u201d and making the basket felt \u201cgood,\u201d according to Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>\u201cKayden can score the ball and make plays, and we all saw that, made the game-winner, but winning is most important to him,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cI think he's had that well before he got to Penn State. I hope we can magnify it even more.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Before he could play AAU ball and during those backyard sessions with his father, he said he remembers some of the drills his father had him do, recalling one that involved making 10 straight left-handed layups.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI remember those days just going back there and struggling,\u201d Mingo said. \u201cBut eventually, I stayed consistent, and then I was able to play AAU. From there, it just took off.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Farmingdale, New York, native played for the PSA Cardinals during his AAU career, which is a grassroots basketball program based in New York City that competes on the Nike EYBL circuit.</p>\n                <p>During the 2024 season, while playing for the PSA Cardinals, Mingo averaged 18.1 points, 3.9 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 2.3 steals per game. He was named Nike EYBL Defensive MVP by The Circuit in the spring of that year, leading his team to a 19-6 record.</p>\n                <p>Alongside his AAU days, Mingo attended Long Island Lutheran High School (LuHi), which helped lay the foundation for his development as a player at a high-major college.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like I left my mark there, confidently and humbly,\u201d Mingo said. \u201cI feel like I was in a very good situation at LuHi, and it prepared me to come here, even though there's a lot more I learned here and a lot more experience I have with basketball.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo sat around the top of the recruiting ranks at the end of his career at LuHi, getting tabbed as a 247Sports composite 4-star and the No. 37 player nationally, No. 5 combo guard and No. 2 player in his home state.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades first heard of him during Mingo\u2019s sophomore year of high school, when he guided LuHi to a 2023 NYS Class AA Federation championship. Rhoades circled Mingo\u2019s name after he got to see him play.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I started building a relationship with Kayden, I was like \u2018Hey, this guy could not just be a heck of a player for us, but he could be a cornerpiece of us building this program and how we do things,\u2019\u201d Rhoades said when Mingo signed with Penn State in 2024. \u201cHe\u2019s got great talent. He has a competitive edge that I sure love.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said he recruited Mingo as he \u201creally cares about the right stuff.\u201d The coach cited some college basketball players who prioritize an eye-catching individual performance over their team winning, and he said Mingo is the opposite.</p>\n                <p>Mingo capped off his high school career by earning the New York Gatorade Player of the Year award in March 2025. He averaged 13.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.9 steals per game through 27 appearances his senior year.</p>\n                <p>But beyond that high, individual honor, Mingo led his team to the 2025 Throne High School National Championship, the EYBL Scholastic League championship game and a Chipotle Nationals quarterfinals appearance.</p>\n                <p>With his high school career in the books, Mingo and his winning drive arrived in Happy Valley last June. He said it took a week or two to get used to summer workouts at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was different,\u201d Mingo said of his first practice with the Nittany Lions. \u201cIt was real high intensity, and it was just different for me, since I'm coming from high school. It was very exciting going into it, and then it was great, finally getting on the court with these guys and be able to play with brothers.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Buzz grew within the program this past offseason on his potential. Rhoades said Mingo was given the \u201ckeys to the program\u201d during Big Ten media days in October.</p>\n                <p>Even though Penn State as a team didn\u2019t have much outside expectations \u2014 the Nittany Lions were ranked No. 18 in the Big Ten preseason media poll \u2014 Mingo said it was an expectation of his to win as many games as possible.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's gonna be a young guy with a lot of opportunity to prove himself in a great league,\u201d assistant coach Clay Conner said in October. \u201cIt'll be exciting to watch, and we're all fired up to help him along the way.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo didn\u2019t waste any time to start showcasing his winning ability, gathering a defensive rebound before charging upcourt and getting an and-1 layup to fall late in the second half of the season-opener against Fairfield. That play kicked off a run for Penn State to earn a 76-68 win over the Stags.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is 1-10 in Big Ten play this season, but Mingo has willed the Nittany Lions to keep up with top competition at times, like him tallying 11 points and eight assists during a 76-72 loss to then-No. 9 Michigan State on Dec. 13. His performance prompted Spartans head coach Tom Izzo to say he\u2019s \u201ca Mingo fan\u201d postgame.</p>\n                <p>Mingo said he sees himself making the NBA once his collegiate career is over. He\u2019s averaging 14.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.1 steals per game through 19 appearances this season, showing a tough playstyle that wants to win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'm a winner before anything,\u201d Mingo said. \u201cI can get downhill as a guard, I can shoot the three pretty well. I get my teammates involved very well, and I have a knack for locking up on defense.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Olympic preview | Matilde Fantin, Italy\u2019s road to gold in 2026 Olympics",
    "author": "Jimmy Blair | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>As Italy prepares to host the 2026 Winter Olympics, the Italian women\u2019s hockey squad is preparing to put on a show in its home country. One of Penn State\u2019s own talents, Matilde Fantin, is ready to make a name for herself on the world stage.</p>\n                <p>Going into the competition, Fantin looks to be one of Italy\u2019s top threats on offense. They will have their work cut out for them, as Italy was drawn into Group B, alongside Japan, Sweden, Germany and France. Because Italy received an automatic bid to the group stages as the host country, all Group A teams will advance to the quarterfinals, while the top three squads from Group B will fill out the next round.</p>\n                <p>According to ESPN\u2019s projections, Italy has the second-lowest odds to take gold in women\u2019s hockey. However, an overwhelming home-ice advantage could give the squad the boost they need to make it out of the group stage, and potentially make a run in the tournament.</p>\n                <p>Step One: Preliminary Rounds</p>\n                <p>Italy opens its campaign against France on Thursday at 8:40 a.m. EST. It faces Sweden next, two days later, on Saturday at the same time. Italy faces Japan on Monday at 6:10 a.m. EST, followed by Germany the next day at 10:40 a.m.</p>\n                <p>As long as Italy doesn\u2019t drop to the bottom two of the group, the hosts will be through the quarterfinals.</p>\n                <p>Step Two: Quarterfinals</p>\n                <p>Italy needs to secure a top-three finish in Group B to reach the quarterfinals, meaning Fantin and the team have to make every game count to achieve a feat they haven\u2019t done for the first time since the 2006 Turin Olympics.</p>\n                <p>Assuming they make it through, international juggernauts like Team USA, Canada, Finland and Switzerland will all make it through. The Italians will have to face off against one of these sides or one of the nations from Group B that also advanced.</p>\n                <p>Since Italy hasn\u2019t made it to the quarterfinals in 20 years, they will certainly have a chip on their shoulder. If they can take advantage of their home-ice advantage, the Italians may be able to achieve what they never achieved before.</p>\n                <p>Step Three: Semifinals</p>\n                <p>This would be a dream scenario for the Italians, as they have never made it this far in the tournament. Italy will most likely face off against one of the top nations in the world on its home ice.</p>\n                <p>If the Italians can handle the pressure, control all three areas of the ice and maybe add in a bit of Olympic magic, the unthinkable could happen.</p>\n                <p>Step Four: Finals</p>\n                <p>The Italians will have to defeat one of the world's top squads to reach their first-ever final and will likely face Team USA or Team Canada for the gold medal.</p>\n                <p>Italy has never taken a medal in ice hockey in its history, and there is no better time than to break the standard and hoist silverware in its home country on the biggest stage, not just for Fantin, but for the entire Italian squad, as well.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",

He was getting evaluated after he hit his head on a Minnesota player.</p>\n                <p>Fatigue with short bench</p>\n                <p>Penn State gave up a 10-point lead in the final couple of minutes of Sunday\u2019s game against Minnesota before Mingo\u2019s game-winning basket. Some of that could be attributed to fatigue as the Nittany Lions were dealing with a short bench.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOne way to avoid fatigue is to go to your bench,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWhen you don't have a bench, then you gotta call some time outs. You got to sub some guys before media timeouts so they could get some dead-time rest, as we like to call it. So you got to be a little strategic that way.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades instilled an \u201cempty the tank\u201d mentality in players prior to facing the Golden Gophers. It worked out as Penn State got the victory, but moving forward, the team\u2019s rotation could be as small as seven players, depending on the availability of the current injuries.</p>\n                <p>Furthermore, Rhoades stuck with the same five players down the stretch in the Minnesota game. Mingo, guard Freddie Dilione V, guard Melih Tunca and forward Josh Reed all played above 30 minutes in Sunday\u2019s game, and guard Dominick Stewart was right behind at 29 minutes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat's the balance that we're going to be in right now, is trying to get guys to the finish line,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe're not a team that we can take plays off. No way. I thought we did a really good job of that on Sunday. I thought we emptied our tank. We were fatigued, which most teams are, in the last three-four minutes of the game. We just got to find a little bit more to finish cleaner than we did.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The State College Borough Council discussed a resolution on Monday calling for the federal government to make \u201ctimely and meaningful\u201d reforms to operations conducted by Immigrations &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n                <p>The resolution, codified as resolution #1436, was proposed by council member Matt Herndon who cited the need for ICE to safeguard constitutional rights, the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti during ICE operations in Minneapolis and efforts by the federal government to provide their own narrative to justify both incidents despite publicly available footage.</p>\n                <p>Herndon said while the council is in support of the lawful enforcement of immigration and other federal laws to ensure public safety, it does not condone the actions of ICE and the federal government which \u201cundermine public trust and raise serious constitutional concerns.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cThese matters are of direct relevance to the Borough of State College, as federal immigration enforcement actions have occurred within the broader community, creating reasonable and immediate concern for the safety, rights, and constitutional protections of residents, workers, and visitors,\u201d Herndon said.</p>\n                <p>Council President Evan Myers said it was important to make clear the council\u2019s stances on ICE\u2019s \u2014 and other federal agencies\u2019 \u2014 conduct, especially since other state officials such as Governor Josh Shapiro have already made their own statements on the matter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAs regimes flail and fail, they strike out at anyone and everyone that would criticize them, and they are now coming for us,\u201d Myers said.</p>\n                <p>Kevin Kassab, another council member, said the council should consider implementing protections for State College\u2019s immigrant population should the resolution cause repercussions from the federal government.</p>\n                <p>He said the council should raise more awareness on its policies regarding immigration operations and posited the possibility of having Penn State provide legal resources to residents.</p>\n                <p>Council Member Nalini Krishnankutty said she has been monitoring the actions by local governments in Cincinnati and Chicago in responding to ICE\u2019s conduct and called on the council to discuss more actionable measures in conjunction with other parts of the Centre Region.</p>\n                <p>Gopal Balachandran, another council member, said he was skeptical that measures such as body cameras being required for federal agents would reduce the chances of an incident occurring between them and citizens</p>\n                <p>He said he was worried the borough may be standing alone in its position through not having the support of the rest of the Democratic Party, considering seven Democrats voted with Republicans to pass a bill increasing ICE funding through the House of Representatives on Jan. 22.</p>\n                <p>Council Member John Hayes said he saw the resolution as a way to ask for accountability through checking ICE\u2019s power.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI appreciate that people that look like me will not bear the brunt of this but I also need to be able to look my children in the eye, or look at my grandchildren in the eye 25 years from now, and say that I said \u2018enough\u2019 and \u2018this was shameful\u2019 and \u2018it's time to stop,\u2019\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for accountability.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After further discussion among the council and the receiving of public comments, the resolution was tabled for discussion at a future meeting.</p>\n                <p>MORE BOROUGH COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Amidst an 11-game losing streak, Penn State is looking for any sign of hope to earn a Big Ten tournament berth with a month left.</p>\n                <p>Despite the recent struggles, the Lady Lions have been united and at their best over the past few days. With a week off between their last game against Minnesota on Jan. 28 and this week\u2019s matchup against Purdue on Wednesday, the Lady Lions have taken full advantage of their practice.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had our best three practices, probably, of the year this week with the off-week and bye-week,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said. \u201cI think we\u2019re really excited going into this game to have players back and players healthy and build off momentum from getting our full squad back together.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State hasn\u2019t won a game since Dec. 20, when it defeated now-coachless VCU 78-66 at the 4 Tha Culture Holiday Classic. Since then, the blue and white has lost both Amiya Evans and Gracie Merkle to injury and has awaited their return.</p>\n                <p>During the bye week, Kieger had her entire squad back together practicing for the first time since early January when Evans was listed on the Jan. 11 availability report.</p>\n                <p>While Merkle and Evans\u2019 statuses are still up in the air for Wednesday\u2019s game, the frontcourt duo being back at practice has been a huge boost to Penn State\u2019s team morale.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGetting Amiya back has been huge for us in practice,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cShe\u2019s such an emotional leader for us, and we\u2019ve missed her drastically over the last couple weeks. Having her back has been a huge spark, she\u2019s got a great presence.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With a full squad on the horizon, Kieger\u2019s focus on one game at a time has shifted more toward qualifying for the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>Over the final month of the season, the Lady Lions\u2019 opponents average just 3.6 conference wins so far compared to January\u2019s opponents, who averaged 6.3 wins.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe obviously have some games against people that are around us in the rankings,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to jump up here and win and play. Purdue\u2019s our first opportunity, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to take advantage of that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s trip to Purdue, Kieger\u2019s team has prepared for the Boilermakers\u2019 balanced team and pressuring them defensively.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think the scariest thing about Purdue is that any given night, someone could go off for 20,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe want to exploit their turnovers and their lack of ball-handling guards in the back court.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Purdue is the third-slowest team in the Big Ten, Penn State holds the advantage with its quick pace of play, and will look to use that on Wednesday and in games moving forward in an effort to make the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEverything motivates us,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win every game that we play, we\u2019re competitors.

    "author": "Elliott Inscho | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will be represented by several athletes in this month\u2019s Olympic Winter Games, but few of them have a story quite as interesting as Dan Barefoot, who will be competing in skeleton, a winter sledding sport, for Team USA.</p>\n                <p>Barefoot grew up in nearby Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and attended Richland High School.</p>\n                <p>He graduated from the university in 2013 with a degree in landscape architecture. The rigor of his academics was a key force in his desire to pursue athletics after graduation.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI probably spent like six hours a day just working in the studio in the architecture school,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cThere was never a moment in my day where I wasn\u2019t doing something, and I think I got used to that. I liked staying busy, and I think that was the reason I attempted to look up the sport.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s hard enough to become an Olympic athlete, let alone in a sport that most Americans haven\u2019t even heard of. The 35-year-old credits his discovery of the unique event to a simple internet search.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI literally just started Googling things,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I came across the sport. Alphabetically, bobsled and skeleton were near the top, and it was one of the first things I clicked on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While he came across the sport in an instant, the journey to its highest level hasn\u2019t been equally as quick for Barefoot. He\u2019s been competing for nearly a decade, this year marking his ninth year involved with the sport, and it\u2019s been a grind to get to where he is.</p>\n                <p>Like many sports, there are several levels of competition that an athlete has to work up in order to reach the peak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe system is set up kind of like Major League Baseball,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cThe World Cup is the MLB, and there\u2019s all these layers under it. You try your best in the lower levels, and once in a while, you get a podium spot. Then the federation moves you up to the next level, and you suck again, but eventually you get another podium spot and they move you up again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Barefoot spent those years working his way up the ranks until he made his first World Cup team about three and a half years ago. As the highest level of skeleton, outside of the Olympics, it was the toughest test yet for the 5-foot-10 athlete.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dogfight up there,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cI was getting my a\u2014 kicked in a couple races, but I also had a couple races that were good. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a total points thing, so you can have a couple bad races, but if you have a couple good races, you get points for those.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With skeleton being such a niche sport, at least on the national stage, Barefoot works as a landscape architect in addition to competing. Balancing work, training and competing became difficult as he began taking it more seriously.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the beginning, I was a landscape architect, and this was a thing that I was trying,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cThat thing that I was trying became more serious, and over time, I was putting more and more effort into the sport and working less and less.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, Barefoot and his superiors decided to transfer him to a part-time employee, so he could continue to pursue skeleton, and that change has worked well for both parties, so far. These games will be Barefoot\u2019s first, and surprisingly, he initially wasn\u2019t as excited to qualify as many would expect.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI had no emotions,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cYou get so focused along the way on the small goals, like if you were driving and looking right in front of your headlights instead of down the road, and that\u2019s the way you make progress. But then, all of a sudden, you get to your destination and you\u2019re like \u2018holy s\u2014.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>He ended up feeling the expected emotion when he told the people who helped him get there.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t until I was texting my mom and responding to Instagram messages from friends that I had before I started the sport, guys whose couch I was sitting on, saying \u2018I\u2019m trying out for this sport,\u2019 and they would say \u2018keep at it, let\u2019s see what happens.\u2019 When I was messaging those guys back, all of a sudden tears started coming to my eyes, and I was like, \u2018holy s\u2014, this is real.\u2019 Because it\u2019s not just a journey for me. So many people have been involved.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Skeleton is unique because of the high speeds and relatively little control the athletes have. Those factors give beginners huge adrenaline rushes, but Barefoot has grown to find peace in the uncontrollable.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOnce you fully commit to something that you know you can't back out from, metaphorically or literally, your body becomes so calm,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cIt locks in. All the noise that would be floating around in your head goes away.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite Barefoot finding it peaceful, skeleton is undoubtedly dangerous. He had a recent run-in with a track worker that will sideline him for his first opportunity to get on the ice in Italy, but it shouldn\u2019t have an effect in competition.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis guy was watching the camera feed,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cExpecting to see when I would start sliding, but it stopped working, and he never saw that happen. As soon as I came out of a corner, and looked up to look at the next one, I saw two legs and a shovel.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The impact caused a tear in his deltoid, which isn\u2019t ideal as he enters the games, but is far better than a joint or bone injury. Those injuries could have prevented an opportunity that Barefoot and those around him had been working towards for years.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy support team, I feel like, was more important than me,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cIn this journey, I feel like I contributed like a third of it, and the other two-thirds is everybody supporting, sharing stories and donating. Without those pieces, I\u2019m not here. I\u2019m looking forward to representing them, feeling excited, and feeling grateful to potentially do a once-in-a-lifetime thing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s been a journey to get to the games for Barefoot, and he\u2019ll finally get a chance to race on the sport\u2019s biggest stage on Feb.12 and 13. Even though the pressure is on, he\u2019s staying grounded as the days approach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThinking about getting a medal at the Olympics doesn\u2019t get you a medal at the Olympics,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cWhat gets you a medal is thinking about the form, the breathing, the small stuff. My goal is to keep it simple, to really relax, enjoy the moment, trust everything that I\u2019ve put in so far, and really lean on that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "5 ways to create the perfect Galentine's Day party",
    "author": "Ava Krysko | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Not to be clich\u00e9, but most people know love comes in many forms, and doesn't always necessarily mean the relationship between a couple. Many out there may scramble to get reservations at a favorite restaurant and buy a perfect Valentine's Day gift \u2014 some may even stress about getting a date \u2014 but Feb. 14 doesn't have to be that way.</p>\n                <p>You can always celebrate the day with friends, who, let's be honest, may be the group of people you love the most. After all, why limit a fabulous holiday filled with candy, affection and hearts to romantic relationships?</p>\n                <p>Galentine's Day is meant to show love to the gal pals and bros in your life. There are so many ways to have a fun Galentine's Day party, and here are five to ensure a great time with your besties.</p>\n                <p>1) Decorate</p>\n                <p>Any proper party thrower knows that decorations are what set the mood for a get together. Boring decorations equal a boring party. Although Valentine's Day decor might not be as easy to find as other major holidays such as Christmas and Halloween, there's still plenty to choose from at stores such as Target and Michaels.</p>\n                <p>If you're on a budget for Galentine's, there's no need to worry, decorating doesn't have to be expensive. With plenty of homemade options that look just as cute, the sky's the limit.</p>\n                <p>For example, heart garlands made of red and pink construction paper or felt are perfect for stunning guests. Another option is painting wine glasses with cute Valentine's designs. Not only does this make for an adorable decoration, but also it provides drinkware.</p>\n                <p>If you doubt your crafting abilities, or simply don't want to take on crafting by yourself, you can always rope in your friends to craft decorations at the party, adding an activity. This can be especially fitting if you're celebrating Galentine's with your roommates.</p>\n                <p>2) Provide food and drinks</p>\n                <p>Possibly the best part of any party is the food. Pizza and hoagies are a classic you may want to serve, or you can go for something a bit more niche like your favorite restaurant or something you've never tried before.</p>\n                <p>Candy salads or charcuterie boards make for perfect appetizers and are aesthetically pleasing as well.</p>\n                <p>When it comes to drinks for Galentine's Day, any pink or red punch or mocktail will do the trick. You can consider making strawberry daiquiris or alcoholic shirley temples for those over 21, and edible glitter can be added to any of these options to make them shine even more.</p>\n                <p>3) Bake a sweet treat</p>\n                <p>If there's any day that's meant for a sweet treat, it's Galentine's Day. There's endless options for dessert, but anything strawberry or cherry-flavored fits the theme the best. This can include strawberry shortcake, cherry tarts or even chocolate-covered strawberries.</p>\n                <p>Baking is especially perfect for Galentine's because it's a practice that uses time and love. Whether you're doing it before the party, or creating a delicacy with your friends, baking takes a lot of heart.</p>\n                <p>4) Watch a rom-com</p>\n                <p>Although it can sometimes take suspension of reality to get into a rom-com (what are the odds you bump into a stranger that just happens to be your perfect match?) when it comes to Galentine's, rom-coms are a perfect way to spend the day.</p>\n                <p>Curling up on the couch with your best friends to gush over a sweet romance can't be beat. Moreover, rom-coms have a certain light-hearted tone that's the best for a day like Galentine's.</p>\n                <p>If rom-coms really aren't your thing, any type of movie can theoretically work. Even horror/slasher movies could possibly be romantic. After all, nothing quite says \"I love you\" like the terror of a serial killer.</p>\n                <p>5) Play a game</p>\n                <p>To ensure that your partygoers don't get bored, adding a game to the festivities never hurts. This can include things such as Valentine's-themed bingo or trivia.</p>\n                <p>Another idea is to have each member of your party create different slideshows to present about various topics. The subjects don't have to be boring \u2014 curating the perfect skincare routine or ex-partner horror stories can make for an interesting presentation.</p>\n                <p>Although this may fall a bit into the baking category, creating a \"Hear Me Out Cake\" may provide some entertainment as well. To do this, you'll need a cake, along with pictures of some unconventional people (or characters, there's no judgment here) you find attractive. Each person takes turns revealing their choices and sticking them onto the cake.</p>\n                <p>Hopefully, these tips will help you create a fun, festive Galentine's Day party with love all around.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "8 must-reads for Black History Month",
    "author": "Ava Krysko | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Although it\u2019s often overlooked, reading is one of the best ways to gain information, especially when learning about a different culture. When it comes to Black History Month, picking up a book can help you become a more informed and aware individual.</p>\n                <p>Whether you decide to pick up a historical fiction novel or an autobiography, reading can help you to explore things you never knew before. To get a better understanding about which books might be helpful, Penn State professors shared eight book recommendations for Black History Month.</p>\n                <p>1) \"The African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality\" by Cheikh Anta Diop</p>\n                <p>First published in 1974, this book presents historical and archaeological information to assert ancient Egyptian civilization was founded by Africans. Although white Egyptologists tried to debunk his theory, Diop argued fiercely that it was correct.</p>\n                <p>This book was recommended by Michael West, professor of African American studies, history and African studies, because he said it is \"foundational for understanding global African history.\"</p>\n                <p>2) \"Black Reconstruction\" by W.E.B. Du Bois</p>\n                <p>Written by renowned author, W.E.B. Du Bois, \"Black Reconstruction\" tells the story of African Americans during the Reconstruction Era. It explores the ways in which Black Americans reshaped democracy and reconstructed America post-Civil War.</p>\n                <p>Also recommended by West, he said it's an important read because of \"its exposition of the Black agency in the single most important event in U.S. experience.\"</p>\n                <p>3) \"The Black Book\" edited and compiled by Toni Morrison</p>\n                <p>\"The Black Book,\" published in 1974, reads like an anthology. It contains stories and historical documents of African Americans from the beginning of slavery to the mid-20th century in America.</p>\n                <p>According to Professor Carmin Wong, a research assistant who recommended the book, \"The Black Book\u201d serves as a visual and documentary archive of Black history in the United States, as it uses photographs, ephemera and historical records to center Black life and cultural memory.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Wong said Morrison makes Black history accessible for wider audiences.</p>\n                <p>\"Morrison was acutely aware of readership, who these stories are written for, who has access to them and who has been excluded,\" Wong said. \u201c\u2018The Black Book\u2019 reflects this awareness with compilations of historical records in a way that invites engagement from readers who may not otherwise encounter Black history in institutional archives or academic texts.\"</p>\n                <p>4) \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\" by Walter Rodney</p>\n                <p>This book takes a look at how Europe exploited Africa's resources for themselves and created overwhelming issues when it comes to the continent\u2019s progress in politics, society and the economy.</p>\n                <p>Wong also recommended this book and described it as, \"a critical examination of colonialism and its long-term economic and social effects on the African continent and African diasporic peoples.\"</p>\n                <p>\u201cRodney argues that the exploitation of Africa led to the underdevelopment and restructuring of pre-colonial African societies, directly challenging narratives that frame colonial rule as beneficial,\u201d Wong said.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Wong described how the book takes a look at how colonialism reshaped racial identities of African people and how it left a lasting legacy of global inequality through structured systems of race, power and capitalism.</p>\n                <p>\"I selected this text because I want to be mindful that we need to turn to Black writers across the globe in discourse on Black history, and Rodney's work provides an essential transnational framework that situates African histories and diasporic experiences as central rather than peripheral to these conversations,\" Wong said.</p>\n                <p>Wong said while this book is a good starting place to learn more about these ideas and understand the function of class in oppressive systems, it should still be followed up by other texts for further education.</p>\n                <p>5) \"The Third Reconstruction: America's Struggle for Racial Justice in the 21st Century\" by Peniel E. Joseph</p>\n                <p>\"The Third Reconstruction,\" published in 2022, explores the idea that the racial reckoning of 2020 was the climax of the third Reconstruction period in America.</p>\n                <p>Darryl Thomas, professor of African American studies, recommended this book and said it compares the first two Reconstruction periods \u2014 along with the backlash that followed them \u2014 and how Black freedom was fostered through the end of current racial regimes.</p>\n                <p>\"Joseph brings attention to the current backlash to the election of Barack Obama as a backlash against diversity, equity and Black freedom,\" Thomas said.</p>\n                <p>6) \"Making All Black Lives Matter: Reimagining Freedom in the 21st Century\" by Barbara Ransby</p>\n                <p>Another book recommended by Thomas, \"Making All Black Lives Matter\" focuses on the role of Black feminists in Black liberation movements.</p>\n                <p>\"She (Ransby) pays special attention to the radical Black feminist and others outside of the American establishment who not only challenge mass incarceration but the marginalization of those outside of the mainstream,\" Thomas said. \"She declares that freedom and democracy are a lifestyle as well as human rights for all.\"</p>\n                <p>7) \"Stamped from the Beginning\" by Ibram X. Kendi</p>\n                <p>Published in 2016, \"Stamped from the Beginning\" centers on the history of racist ideas and how they infiltrated American society.</p>\n                <p>Professor and Co-Director of the Center for Black Digital Research Christopher Dancy recommended this book and said it \"details a useful history as one considers anti-Blackness in the context of U.S. history and present.\"</p>\n                <p>8) \"Freedom Dreams\" by Robin D.G. Kelley</p>\n                <p>\"Freedom Dreams\" chronicles a history of radical Black activism in the United States.</p>\n                <p>Dancy also recommended this book, and suggests everyone read the most recent edition which includes Kelley's reflections in modern times.</p>\n                <p>\"It's a great book for contextualizing Black experiences within histories of the Black radical tradition,\" Dancy said.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>To complete a four-game home stand, No. 4 Penn State took its talents outdoors to Beaver Stadium for the first-ever outdoor hockey game in program history.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions won 3-0 in Friday\u2019s outdoor game and 5-2 on Saturday when the team returned to Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>With its sweep this weekend over Robert Morris, Penn State took the regular-season series against the Colonials 4-0, with goaltender Katie DeSa recording shutouts in three of the four contests.

    "author": "Julia Kushner | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A beloved preparatory ritual signifying unity and controlled transgression, tailgating is so much more than a bunch of silly geese drinking their little faces off.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s nothing more American than college football. And there\u2019s definitely nothing more American than a Ford F-150, burgers and dogs and an ice-cold beer on top of college football.</p>\n                <p>Tailgating is an essential part of game day. We wake up early, dress in our finest blue and white, and break all social barriers.</p>\n                <p>The usual group dynamics are totally shaken up \u2014 parents, students and alumni alike party together and celebrate their shared heritage (if you will) of Penn State ball. We come together, not as different sects of the social strata, but as a singular group with a shared interest.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s a lax way to socialize with both peers and adults, as you\u2019ll inevitably end up with someone\u2019s mother and father, their siblings and maybe even their grandparents. It\u2019s an easy way to flex those social muscles in a setting that eliminates all awkwardness by breaching the normal rules of traditional etiquette.</p>\n                <p>As a Southerner, meeting an adult, I will still say \u201cyes ma\u2019am\u201d or \u201cno sir,\u201d but the hesitancy of chatting with people typically above your social paygrade all but evaporates.</p>\n                <p>And so many people have this \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d attitude. Strike up a conversation with the tailgate next to yours, and you\u2019ll be partying with people you met five seconds ago before you know it.</p>\n                <p>Compare this with the usual attitude of more formal invitations and the Gen Z inability to even smile at your neighbors in the hallways.</p>\n                <p>And we transgress other norms as well. My freshman year, before we sold alcoholic beverages at Beaver Stadium, all of Penn State was a dry campus.</p>\n                <p>That is, except for game days. It was this unspoken rule that you better not be caught dead with liquor in 16802 \u2014 unless it was a fall Saturday, of course.</p>\n                <p>I used to love seeing 18-year-olds traipsing along Millennium Science Complex with a couple of twelve packs in their hands and the police just a hundred yards or so off pretending not to notice.</p>\n                <p>And music is played so loudly, you\u2019d think your eardrums would burst and the police\u2019d come knocking down your door for a noise complaint, but it\u2019s par for the course in the fields above the stadium.</p>\n                <p>America prizes the individual, rightly so, but gamedays let us put our group above ourselves, if just for a couple of fun-filled hours. Tailgating and rooting for a team allow us to prioritize something besides our own little worlds for a change.</p>\n                <p>How nice it is to forget ourselves for a moment to watch Nick Singleton absolutely dominate with 107,000 of your closest friends.</p>\n                <p>People are able to forget about themselves and what they look like and who they\u2019re with for the duration of the day. They\u2019re able to loosen the death grip social media typically has on young people\u2019s everyday lives and live in the moment while they finally touch some grass.</p>\n                <p>And there\u2019s so much symbology. Flags fly everywhere from the stars and bars to the Nittany Lion, from fraternity letters to Nicki Minaj. Next time you find yourself at a tailgate, stop for just a moment and appreciate the camaraderie that college has afforded us.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "title": "Olympic preview | Nicole Hall, Jessica Adolfsson, Team Sweden\u2019s path to the gold medal game",
    "author": "Sami Altmire | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s an Olympic year. Like every other country headed to the Milan Cortina Olympic Games, Team Sweden, with current Nittany Lion, Nicole Hall and former Penn Stater Jessica Adolfsson have a chance to take home the gold.</p>\n                <p>Taking home an Olympic gold medal is one of the oldest sporting honors, but getting there is an accomplishment of its own. Sweden is a powerhouse in the hockey world, and the women's team, commonly known in Sweden as the \u201cDamkronorna\u201d or \u201cThe Lady Crowns,\u201d always held its own. Team Sweden has two medals under its belt; here are the steps it needs to take to secure gold number three.</p>\n                <p>Step One: Preliminary Rounds</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden will face Germany on Feb. 5, Italy on Feb. 7, France on Feb. 8 and Japan on Feb. 10. Depending on the results of those games, Team Sweden will advance to playoff matches in hopes of reaching the gold medal match.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden is looking at redemption this year after a less-than-ideal finish at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, finishing eighth, which is its lowest to date. Historically, it has had a pretty decent run at the Olympics, being a powerhouse among the other teams, so a comeback could very much be in their cards.</p>\n                <p>Looking at the teams it will face, Team Germany and France are returning to the Olympic Games after some time away. Team Germany could struggle against Sweden, as this is its first Olympic appearance since 2014. Team France is making its Olympic debut this year, so taking on an established team like Sweden could be a challenge. Team Italy, featuring Nittany Lion Matilde Fantin, is returning to the games after 20 years. The most accomplished opponent Team Sweden faces in the group stages is Team Japan, which finished ahead of the Swedes at the 2022 Beijing Olympics in fifth place, so that matchup will be one to watch.</p>\n                <p>Step 2: Quarter Finals</p>\n                <p>As of now, there is no guarantee of what the four quarterfinal games will look like, but the pool of teams to choose from is strong. There are powerhouses: Team USA, Team Canada, Team Switzerland and Team Finland, against whom the remaining teams, such as Team Sweden, will have to compete.</p>\n                <p>These matchups will be quality, with every team bringing in new talent and new ideas. Team Sweden, which features young collegiate talent, may consider a new approach in these tournament stage rounds.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden went down in the quarter finals at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, taking a brutal loss from Team Canada, 11-0. Faceoffs were a major struggle for the Swedes, who lost the majority. Confidence can carry them through the group stages and may be the reason they reach the semi-finals.</p>\n                <p>Step 3: Semi-Finals</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden has had major success in the semi-finals; the most memorable is the major upset against Team USA at the 2006 Turin Olympics, in which the team beat the Americans in a shoot out.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden won one of their two medals at the Turin Olympics, securing silver and leaving the Americans with bronze. Reaching medal contention will be a journey, especially for a team focused on rebuilding as much as Team Sweden.</p>\n                <p>Step 4: Finals</p>\n                <p>Reaching medal contention will likely mean getting past Team Switzerland or Team Finland and, most likely, facing Team USA or Canada. The Swedish have the history, the talent and the fire. The Nittany Lions already have multiple Olympians and Olympic medalists, and Team Sweden has the potential to increase that number.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Like any young adult in college, I've been trying to convince myself for years that I won\u2019t get homesick. For me, living in Maryland and going to Penn State, only three hours away, I never really had to worry about it too much. All it takes is a phone call from my parents and they'll come get me or I\u2019ll make the drive home.</p>\n                <p>Now, my home for the next four months is in Barcelona, Spain, 4,000 miles away instead of just under 200 miles. I\u2019ve switched from English to Spanish, use the Barcelona Metro instead of the \u201cWHOOP,\u201d and traded sweat pants for jeans from Zara.</p>\n                <p>When I first got here, I thought to myself, \u201cI\u2019ll be so busy, I won\u2019t even have time to get homesick.\u201d And I was right, at the beginning.</p>\n                <p>My second weekend here, I hopped on a plane to the Scottish Highlands. I spent two days off the coast of Spain, only an hour from Barcelona. My week was booked and busy with clubs, cafes, and repeat. I didn\u2019t have time to get homesick. Then, I had my weekly FaceTime with my family and my mom was cruel enough to ask if I missed her.</p>\n                <p>Once she asked that single question I would get lost in my thoughts to and from class.</p>\n                <p>I would get quiet at night, knowing their sun was still shining while I was stuck with the moon. I missed them terribly.</p>\n                <p>Knowing myself, however, I knew I would drive myself crazy if I kept myself in that homesick funk, so I turned to my constants. Fast food and TV dramas.</p>\n                <p>While I grieve the absence of Chipotle and Chick-fil-a, and I can no longer hop into my car and drive through Happy Valley, I found other avenues. I turned away from the one euro tacos for a meal at KFC and McDonald's.</p>\n                <p>I finally figured out how to change the Spanish audio to English on my TV in my apartment and scrolled for hours on Hulu, watching episode after episode of cringey American shows.</p>\n                <p>When I caught a cold, I sacrificed a class absence to journey to the 24-hour markets and scour for a pack of Oreo\u2019s and Diet Coke (or Coca-Cola Zero as they say here) and watched movies snuggled up in my bed, imagining I was back at home or in my apartment in State College.</p>\n                <p>I did anything that reminded me of being in Maryland or Penn State, keeping myself tethered to my old self while I became a new person at the same time. I worked around the time differences and reached out to my roommates back home and other friends abroad, keeping my relationships alive and constant.</p>\n                <p>I reminded myself that my life would still be there when I returned, and I reminded myself that being abroad was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>\n                <p>Almost a month now, I have special routines. I allow myself to eat fast food once or twice a week. I\u2019ll have a Pink Drink from Starbucks instead of a caf\u00e9 con leche.</p>\n                <p>While there\u2019s so much to be seen in Barcelona, and so many new things to throw and immerse myself into, it\u2019s important to have a balance. Give yourself some time to FaceTime your parents, or watch a Netflix movie with your roommates abroad, just to get a little taste of what\u2019s waiting for you back at home.</p>\n                <p>MORE ABROAD COLUMNS</p>",

A major home upset took place in Minnesota while another conference foe earned its first win.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State stays undefeated</p>\n                <p>Ohio State defeated No. 17 Wisconsin and No. 10 Michigan in a two-dual weekend. The Buckeyes won 30-10 and 26-16, respectively, moving to 16-0 on the season.</p>\n                <p>The Buckeyes were trailing the Badgers 10-9 at the intermission, causing some major questions, but that was without their top 125-pound wrestler.</p>\n                <p>Nic Bouzakis has been alternating starts if Ohio State wrestles twice in a weekend, causing him to not wrestle against the Badgers. Wisconsin\u2019s Nicolar Rivera won the match at 125 pounds after Vinceng Kilkeary filled in for Bouzakis.</p>\n                <p>The other headliner was the final bout between Michigan and Ohio State. No. 7 Taye Ghadiali of Michigan and No. 3 Nick Feldman went to sudden victory, where Ghadiali took down Feldman to get the upset victory. It didn\u2019t matter for the dual, but with the postseason around the corner, Ghadiali could improve his seeding in the Big Ten and NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota upsets Iowa</p>\n                <p>No. 9 Minnesota went into Carver-Hawkeye Arena and took down No. 4 Iowa in a close battle. The Golden Gophers defeated the Hawkeyes, 21-16, on the road behind some headlining victories.</p>\n                <p>Max McEnelly didn\u2019t have to face Angelo Ferrari, but was still tested at 184 pounds. Gabe Arnold stepped in and performed well, not allowing a takedown through seven minutes of action. With eight seconds remaining in sudden victory, McEnelly took down Arnold to get the victory, 4-1.</p>\n                <p>With Ferrari\u2019s status still unknown, Arnold appears to be a proven wrestler who can compete with the top, but it was McEnelly who was the better wrestler, expanding the lead to 15-13.</p>\n                <p>At 157 pounds, Minnesota\u2019s Charlie Millard, ranked No. 21, defeated No. 12 Jordan Williams by major decision. Williams was the favorite entering the match, but Millard put that to rest quickly, defeating Williams 13-3.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State earns first conference win</p>\n                <p>Two of the bottom teams in the conference, Michigan State and Northwestern, battled it out in East Lansing, Michigan. The Spartans earned their first win of the season, defeating the Wildcats, 22-20.</p>\n                <p>It was a late push from Northwestern, as the dual began at 197 pounds. With Michigan State holding a 22-9 lead after the 157-pound weight class, the Wildcats picked things up.</p>\n                <p>They needed at least a tech fall and two-major decisions, to get to the 22-point mark. Eddie Enright did his job at 174 pounds for Northwestern, winning by major decision, but the 165 pound and 184-pound class ended in decisions, giving Michigan State its first Big Ten dual win of the season.</p>\n                <p>Massoma Endene</p>\n                <p>Massoma Endene has been in the headlines for weeks. After being dismissed by Iowa in early January, it\u2019s reported by Justin Basch that Endene will enter the transfer portal and file for a medical redshirt.</p>\n                <p>With not wrestling since November, Endene\u2019s redshirt will likely go through giving him the chance to compete at the Division I level once again. He won a trio of Division III national championships at Wartburg College before transferring to Iowa. He was removed from the Hawkeyes\u2019 roster and will instantly become a major target for teams with or without a major need at 197 pounds.</p>\n                <p>Endene was ranked well into the top 10 before being removed from the program, and had some hype to be the biggest test for the current No. 1 at the weight class, Josh Barr.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State is one loss away from tying its second-worst losing streak in program history and has a chance to stop that this week.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions travel to Indiana to face Purdue at 7:00 p.m. Wednesday with just over a month left of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>With Penn State needing at least two wins to clinch the Big Ten tournament, here\u2019s a look at the first game down the must-win stretch.</p>\n                <p>Matchup history</p>\n                <p>Despite Purdue being an inferior team over the past several years, the Lady Lions have an all-time losing record against the Boilermakers.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is 25-36 in its matchup history, dating back to 1988.</p>\n                <p>Over the past 10 years, that losing streak is also prevalent, with the blue and white falling 6-8.</p>\n                <p>Last year\u2019s matchup</p>\n                <p>The Boilermakers won their first matchup in two years against Penn State last February, coming into the Bryce Jordan Center on Senior Day and winning 92-85.</p>\n                <p>After entering the second quarter up just one point, Purdue dominated the second period. The Boilermakers ultimately finished the first half up 11 points and held that lead the rest of the game.</p>\n                <p>Purdue was led by Rashunda Jones and Sophie Swanson, who combined for 61 points. However, Jones left for Michigan State and Swanson for Virginia Tech during the offseason, so Purdue has been left to find a new leading scorer.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions were also led by Gabby Elliott and Grace Hall, who now play for Arizona State and SMU. The duo scored 32 points and 16 points, respectively.</p>\n                <p>Current redshirt junior Gracie Merkle also scored double-digits against Purdue, recording 10 points, six rebounds and two blocks.</p>\n                <p>Scouting Purdue</p>\n                <p>Despite a rough start to the season with a loss to satellite campus Purdue Fort Wayne, the Boilermakers have since recovered and are tentatively in the Big Ten Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Purdue earned three conference wins in January, beginning with an eight-point victory over Wisconsin. That win then fueled the Boilermakers to an overtime upset of then-No. 23 Washington.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions have since lost to both teams, falling to the Huskies by 16 points on their West Coast trip.</p>\n                <p>This year\u2019s Purdue squad is a lower-scoring team, averaging only 69.7 points per game. However, all 12 of its athletes have consistently contributed to its scoring and the team has had nine different starters this year.</p>\n                <p>Redshirt junior Tara Daye leads the Boilermakers with 12.6 points per game after transferring from St. John\u2019s. Junior Kiki Smith has also been a high-scorer, averaging 10.2 points per game after her year at Arkansas.</p>\n                <p>Purdue\u2019s solid starters will be tested when high-scoring Kiyomi McMiller, Moriah Murray and Merkle come to town on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/men_basketball/weekly-recap-penn-state-men-s-basketball-narrowly-falls-to-ranked-opponents/article_ab7c4eea-b6fb-439a-9931-90512c131108.html\" target=\"_blank\">Well, it\u2019s been a while since a recap on Penn State men\u2019s basketball was released, and it\u2019s fair to say a recap is needed.</a></p>\n                <p>The last published recap was in mid-January, and it appeared the Nittany Lions had a chance to turn a corner after a three-game losing skid against ranked opponents to start the new year.</p>\n                <p>Yet, since that stretch, the blue and white dropped five straight until it finally got back into the win column, and the need to reflect is at a peak. Now, 1-10 in the Big Ten and 10-12 overall, the blue and white have a chance to not only finish on a strong note, but with some momentum for the future.</p>\n                <p>Really, now?</p>\n                <p>The play on the court hasn\u2019t been ideal over the last couple of weeks, and the personnel available haven\u2019t been consistent either. Top scorers Freddie Dilione V and Kayden Mingo endured light nicks that affected their play, while all three international big men, Sas\u01ce Ciani, Ivan Juri\u0107, and Tibor Mirti\u0107, all missed action due to various reasons.</p>\n                <p>The injuries fractured morale and the quality of play, which hadn\u2019t been high over the end of January and into February. With conference play in its full swing, it\u2019s a disastrous time to see high-profile absences and to endure those devastating losses at the same time. For a young squad that didn\u2019t earn its first Big Ten win until a last-second Mingo buzzer-beater over Minnesota, the emotions within the team are extremely volatile, and fate hasn\u2019t necessarily been the kindest.</p>\n                <p>Moving forward, a unit that has endured small setbacks at potentially the worst times has a chance to show that those unforeseen circumstances are why the season did not go well, rather than because of the player\u2019s limited ceiling.</p>\n                <p>Rewarding Reed</p>\n                <p>As the results haven\u2019t been good, neither have the players' performances. The one silver lining over the past few weeks of play is the emergence of Josh Reed as a primary scorer for Penn State. Prior to these last contests, the lone senior on the Nittany Lions was reduced to a leadership role, where most of his contributions are limited to intangibles that don\u2019t show up in the box score.</p>\n                <p>While that\u2019s been largely the story for Reed\u2019s entire collegiate career, the Atlanta native saw his role morph as the Penn State absences piled up, and the wing with a career average of 4.1 points per game reached double-digit scoring in his last six outings.</p>\n                <p>He scored 18 points twice, also over those couple of weeks, only one short of his career high.</p>\n                <p>Over that stretch, Reed has been efficient despite not being a primary scorer; in those six games, he has averaged over 30 minutes and shot over 50% in every game but one.</p>\n                <p>Where does the scoring come?</p>\n                <p>While Reed took the scoring reins over the past couple of weeks, scoring also became more spread out in atypical ways. Eli Rice, Mingo, Reed and Dilione all took times as leading scorers, and those four contribute their baskets in different ways.</p>\n                <p>Rice has the three-point shot, Dilione the slick handles, Mingo a unique downhill speed and Reed a unforeseen veteran scrapiness. The Nittany Lions have developed the ability to score by anyone and in any way; the only uphill battle now is doing so consistently and together.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

The two projected starters are Max Granville and Yvan Kemajou.</p>\n                <p>Granville missed all of 2025 with injury, but saw his stock rise at the end of 2024 as a rotational piece in the playoffs and notably filled in for Abdul Carter when he left the Fiesta Bowl due to injury.</p>\n                <p>Kemajou burned his redshirt last year, appearing in 10 games where he notched 13 total tackles and 1.5 sacks. Behind them will be a pair of transfers in Ikenna Ezeogu from Iowa State and Alexander McPherson from Colorado.</p>\n                <p>Ezeogu will be the rare veteran in the group of defensive ends, having recorded 60 total tackles, and three sacks since 2023. McPherson appeared in 10 games for the Buffaloes, tallying 16 total tackles, six quarterback pressures and a blocked punt.</p>\n                <p>Defensive tackle</p>\n                <p>1.Siale Taupaki, redshirt senior +</p>\n                <p>2.

Armstrong Nnodim, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Just like defensive end, Penn State will need to fill in holes at defensive tackle with Zane Durant and Alonzo Ford Jr. off to the NFL as well as Xavier Gilliam transferring.</p>\n                <p>The starters will be Siale Taupaki and Keanu Williams, who both come from UCLA. Taupaki is entering his eighth year of college football, which has featured a handful of injuries and switching from defensive line to offensive line and then back to defensive line.</p>\n                <p>Williams spent his first two years at Oregon before his last three with the Bruins, and has posted 59 total tackles in his collegiate career.</p>\n                <p>Behind the ex-Bruins will be Dallas Vakalahi from Utah and Armstrong Nnodim from Oklahoma State. Valkalahi recorded 27 total tackles with the Utes in two seasons while Nnodim had 11 total tackles in 2025 after redshirting the year before.</p>\n                <p>Linebacker</p>\n                <p>WILL:</p>\n                <p>1. Tony Rojas, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>2. Cael Brezina, junior</p>\n                <p>MIKE:</p>\n                <p>1. Caleb Bacon, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Rojas</p>\n                <p>SAM:</p>\n                <p>1. Kooper Ebel, senior</p>\n                <p>2. Alex Tatsch, sophomore</p>\n                <p>Penn State will need to replace the production of Amare Campbell, who garnered 103 total tackles in his lone season in State College after transferring in from North Carolina and has since transferred to Tennessee.</p>\n                <p>The bright spot for the Nittany Lions is the return of Tony Rojas, who suffered a long-term injury following the loss to Oregon. Before that, Rojas was playing some solid ball, notching 25 total tackles and a pair of sacks. He\u2019s a strong candidate to be a captain in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Outside of Rojas, the reinforcements at linebacker come from Iowa State, as the top-three players at the position for the Cyclones a year ago, Caleb Bacon, Kooper Ebel and Cael Brezina, bring their talents to Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Bacon and Ebel combined for 145 tackles, while Brezina chipped in 29 himself.</p>\n                <p>Another name to keep an eye on is Alex Tatsch, who saw an uptick in snaps to end 2025 and burned his redshirt in the process. He suffered an injury during bowl prep leading up to the Pinstripe Bowl, and there is no current update on his status moving forward.</p>\n                <p>Cornerback</p>\n                <p>Outside:</p>\n                <p>1. Audavion Collins, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Daryus Dixson, sophomore</p>\n                <p>3. Jahmir Joseph, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>Nickel:</p>\n                <p>1. Zion Tracy, senior</p>\n                <p>2. Omarion Davis, sophomore</p>\n                <p>As far as retaining talent, the cornerback room had a successful offseason despite losing A.J. Harris and Elliot Washington II to the transfer portal, back are Audavion Collins, Daryus Dixson, Zion Tracy and Jahmir Joseph.</p>\n                <p>Collins, Dixson and Tracy all started in the Pinstripe Bowl \u2014 Collins and Tracy were starters the whole year.</p>\n                <p>Collins has been one of the program\u2019s biggest risers over the last few years, earning himself a starting job in 2025 after transferring in from Mississippi State in 2023. In 2025, he had 47 total tackles and three pass breakups in his first year as a starter.</p>\n                <p>Dixson was a huge recruiting win in the 2025 class, as he was a highly touted prospect from national powerhouse Mater Dei in California. He burned his redshirted and surpassed Harris and Washington for playing time by the end of the regular season, accumulating 22 total tackles and six pass break ups.</p>\n                <p>Tracy held down the nickel spot, tallying 32 tackles with five tackles for loss a year ago. He missed two games at the start of the year due to injury, where ex-Nittany Lion Kenny Woseley Jr. started, but he has since transferred to Virginia Tech.</p>\n                <p>Jahmir Joseph is a young player who flashed with a pick-6 against Villanova. He maintained his redshirt, but saw extended run in the Pinstripe Bowl, logging five total tackles and a pass breakup.</p>\n                <p>Boston College transfer Omarion Davis could be a candidate to be the backup nickel. 2025 was his freshman year, where he played in all 12 games with a pair of starts, recording 13 total tackles. Davis played safety for the Eagles, but has the athletic profile to slot in at nickel with his 5-foot-11, 185-pound frame.</p>\n                <p>Safety</p>\n                <p>Strong safety:</p>\n                <p>1. Marcus Neal Jr., junior</p>\n                <p>2. Vaboue Toure, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Free safety:</p>\n                <p>1. Jeremiah Cooper, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Jamison Patton, senior</p>\n                <p>Safety is another position where Penn State will see a handful of new faces with Zakee Wheatley off to the NFL as well as King Mack and Dejuan Lane transferring.</p>\n                <p>Iowa State transfer Marcus Neal Jr. will start at strong safety, coming off of a 2025 campaign where he started as a sophomore, and a third-team All-Big 12 selection. Other than quarterback Rocco Becht, he is viewed to be the biggest addition via the portal for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Alongside him at free safety will be ex-Cyclone Jeremiah Cooper, who was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2023, but missed 2025 after four games due to a season-ending knee injury. During his time with Iowa State, he garnered 138 total tackles and eight interceptions.</p>\n                <p>Cooper started his career as a safety, but moved to cornerback in 2025. However, the path for playing time is easier for him at safety with the room having more uncertainties than cornerback.</p>\n                <p>For rotational pieces, Penn State has Vaboue Toure and Iowa State transfer Jamison Patton.</p>\n                <p>Through three seasons with the Cyclones, Patton recorded 79 total tackles and four interceptions. If Cooper starts at cornerback, Patton will likely be the favorite to start at free safety next to Neal.</p>\n                <p>Toure appeared in 11 games in 2025 after redshirting the year before, notching 13 total tackles and a sack. He flashed in the Pinstripe Bowl with seven total tackles.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "\u2018Really proud of him\u2019 | Freddie Dilione V showcases scrappy playstyle to help Penn State beat Minnesota",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Mike Rhoades told his players to \u201cempty the tank\u201d before facing Minnesota, with the team dealing with a smaller rotation due to multiple injuries, and one player in particular seemed to take that to heart.</p>\n                <p>Guard Freddie Dilione V tied his career-high with 25 points to help lead the Nittany Lions to a 77-75 win over the Golden Gophers on Sunday, but it wasn\u2019t just his offense that stuck out to Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFreddie can make plays, and what I was proud of Freddie today is he played defense,\u201d Rhoades said postgame. \u201cHe played defense. He had five rebounds. He was in some scuffles. He was going after the ball today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dilione played with a high motor on defense, totaling three steals in addition to his four defensive rebounds, which is the second most he\u2019s gotten in Big Ten play this season. His steal at the 13:44 mark of the first half led to him making a fast-break dunk to give Penn State an early 15-9 lead.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt junior\u2019s defense helped set up offensive possessions for the Nittany Lions. Dilione shot 64.7% from the field, which is his third-best shooting percentage of the season.</p>\n                <p>Entering Sunday\u2019s matchup, Dilione hadn\u2019t shot more than 50% from the field since the Pitt game on Dec. 21. He was held to 8.2 points per game between the UCLA and Northwestern games \u2014 a stark change for a player who\u2019s usually in double figures.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHad a bad stretch the past few games but finally found it again,\u201d Dilione said postgame. \u201cIt was really no plan to it, just mental, just stuff I've been doing. Shout out to (point guard Kayden Mingo). He got me the ball.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dilione was sitting next to Mingo during a postgame availability, and the two smiled at each other after Dilione gave credit to Mingo. In response, Mingo said that Dilione was scoring on his own throughout the game, highlighting his shot-creation ability.</p>\n                <p>When he scores on his own, Dilione typically finds his spot: typically a mid-range jumper near the free-throw line. He had two unassisted baskets in the second half, including one at the 6:31 mark to give the Nittany Lions a 69-58 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Dilione made a few other key plays down the stretch, such as his offensive rebound with 5:02 left in the game, leading to a second-chance bucket by forward Josh Reed. That basket was made possible by Dilione, and it gave Penn State enough cushion to fend off a late comeback attempt by Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>As the Golden Gophers came storming back, Dilione got a layup to fall to generate a 73-70 Penn State lead with 2:09 left. He was also an option on the final possession of the game, but Mingo ended up keeping the ball for himself.</p>\n                <p>Regardless, the plays that Dilione showcased Sunday are what Rhoades is looking for out of him moving forward.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don't mean in a negative way, but like, we need a dirty Freddie,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe need him to be grimy because we all know he could score. And he did that today. I told him, \u2018If you don't do that, it's gonna be really hard.\u2019 And he did that. He scrapped tonight. Really proud of him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Emma Naysmith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>With THON Weekend 2026 just a little over two weeks away, it\u2019s time for dancers to begin preparing for the highly anticipated 46 hours.</p>\n                <p>THON is the world's largest student-run philanthropy that aims to provide emotional and financial support to Four Diamonds families who have been impacted by childhood cancer.</p>\n                <p>Dancer Relations Committee Outreach Coordinator Olivia Johnston said THON provides several resources for dancers to help prepare themselves for the long weekend.</p>\n                <p>Some of these resources include dancer wellness packets, a more thorough dancer wellness guide, a dancer survival guide and the opportunity to attend a virtual dancer panel where first-time participants can ask previous dancers questions.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere isn't a specific plan we recommend, like a step-by-step guide of how to perfectly prepare to stand for 46 hours,\u201d Johnston, a fourth-year studying psychology, said. \u201cIn general, we suggest to hydrate, eat healthy, light workouts, nothing too strenuous on your body and definitely stretch.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Johnston also mentioned dancers are encouraged to get ahead on sleep and build their immunity prior to the weekend. Additionally, she said another huge tip is to begin reducing caffeine intake and even entering a dry period to help further avoid any illnesses or withdrawals.</p>\n                <p>THON dancers are also supported by Dancer Relations Committee members (DRCM) who they\u2019re encouraged to meet prior to the weekend. Johnston said these committee members are \u201cwell-rounded\u201d in their education to help support dancers in numerous instances.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey have all the specific times that they need to know, special event times, floor event times, anything that will keep them entertained,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThey also are being educated on mental health tips and tricks and how to deal with \u2026 the mental aspect of dancing for 46 hours.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Second-generation THON dancer Maddie Langlois danced last year with Alpha Kappa Psi and said it was an amazing experience to have been a part of.</p>\n                <p>Langlois, a fourth-year studying marketing, said THON does a lot to provide dancers with resources and support. She remembers when struggling at one point, her DRCM stepped in and was \u201cso helpful.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cEven though that was one of the hardest weekends, it's only a fraction of what some of these families are dealing with,\u201d Langlois said. \u201cIt's really eye opening and has really altered the path of my life and how I view things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Langlois said it was difficult to prepare for standing, but believes mental preparation can make a significant impact.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYour feet are going to hurt and you're going to be tired,\u201d Langlois said. \u201cBut if your mind is still with it, then I think that really helps.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Throughout the weekend, Langlois remembers thinking about her organization's THON families through the Adopt-a-Family (AAF) program, and particularly one child who was going through a difficult time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you can think of something that's why you're THON-ing \u2026 that can be really helpful to say it to yourself, and stick with that throughout the weekend,\u201d Langlois said. \u201cBecause then you're like, \u2018This is why I'm here. This is why I'm doing this. This is super important to me.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>Benjamin Guenther found out in November that he was chosen to dance by his brothers at Delta Sigma Pi, alongside two of his roommates.</p>\n                <p>Physically, Guenther, a fourth-year studying agricultural and biorenewable systems management, said he and his fellow dancing brothers have started eating clean, avoiding large crowds to prevent sickness and staying physically in shape. He even said that he and about 30 of his brothers ran the Philadelphia Half Marathon together.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe keep thinking of how hard our brothers are working, how hard they have worked, not only just for THON Weekend, but this whole entire year is a fundraising year in total, and then just helping our families, knowing that this isn't a fight that they have to go through for a year,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cThis is a fight they have to go through their whole entire life. We just have to stand for 46 hours.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Guenther also said he is looking forward to DSP\u2019s THON gala, where all of the dancers, THON chairs and AAF families have the opportunity to speak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSeeing how we've really been able to give into our families, lets you put down everything \u2026 and really allow for yourself to become more prepared for THON Weekend,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cIt really allows for our dancers to become extremely motivated for this weekend, and to see how hard every single brother has worked, and see how much our families really have appreciated that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Guenther said DSP THON enforces the idea that THON is a community, a home and a place for all \u2014 whether it be your first THON or your last.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFrom an internal perspective on THON, it's impossible to explain, but from an external perspective on THON, it's impossible to understand,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cYou could go around anywhere in the country, and you're not going to find something like this.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE THON CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Talia Rittenhouse | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Entering the new year, it\u2019s time to transport back to the beloved era, 2016.</p>\n                <p>Picture it \u2014 it\u2019s giving Tumblr, palm trees, Justin Bieber in his prime and selfies galore.</p>\n                <p>Many trends emerged in 2016 across fashion, makeup and various styles. However, some should stay back in those years of frappuccinos, Dubsmash and ombre Instagram filters. On the other hand, some trends should absolutely be welcomed back in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Here's what we should leave in 2016 and bring back in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Leave in 2016</p>\n                <p>Flower crowns</p>\n                <p>Most popularly purchased at Claire\u2019s, Justice and pretty much any store at this time.</p>\n                <p>I think this one will be widely agreed upon to leave in 2016. I\u2019m not sure people will enjoy struggling to see the boards in class, dodging the arrangements of flowers atop students\u2019 heads.</p>\n                <p>While I understand there\u2019s a vision here with the springtime fashion, in 2026, especially in the winter, it's not the time to bring this back.</p>\n                <p>Not to mention how uncomfortable they were, getting stuck in people\u2019s hair \u2014 I'm surprised the trend didn\u2019t end sooner, 10 years ago.</p>\n                <p>Colored sunglasses</p>\n                <p>Now this one can remain in 2016, the classic Five Below colored rim and colored lens sunglasses.</p>\n                <p>Personally, I had an embarrassingly large collection of these, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in this statement, considering the generation of students here at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>They came in any color you could imagine, sat on the shelves at almost every store, and yet, the trend only lasted a year or so, at least it should have.</p>\n                <p>So yes, these were still being worn in 2018, but that is not an explanation to why they should return and disrupt fashion 10 years later.</p>\n                <p>Infinity Scarves</p>\n                <p>These were perfect for their time. They were stylish with a sweater and jeans, but only in 2016.</p>\n                <p>Now in State College, our infinity scarves have slowly morphed into the scarves we wear on campus to keep warm in the treacherous wind and negative temperatures.</p>\n                <p>However, this does not mean they need to return in polkadot patterns, plaid and other prints, nor stay on throughout classes.</p>\n                <p>So again, and respectfully, let\u2019s stick to this trend in keeping warm, and not as a revived style.</p>\n                <p>Revive in 2026</p>\n                <p>Jean shorts</p>\n                <p>Now this one I would love to see make a comeback in 2026.</p>\n                <p>While jean shorts can be uncomfortable, they provide an easy and simple go-to outfit option for the spring and summer.</p>\n                <p>That said, please, oh please, the studded jean shorts do not need to make a reappearance. In combination with styles these days, I think our wardrobes would slowly begin to resemble the Justice displays from our local malls with this style of shorts.</p>\n                <p>But jean shorts are a perfect staple, just like the jeans students wear to class and out at night.</p>\n                <p>Baby Lips and EOS</p>\n                <p>Lip glosses and chapsticks are still a current trend this year, ranging from Summer Fridays to Burt's Bees.</p>\n                <p>I see this as a perfect opportunity for EOS and Maybelline Baby Lips to come back to our makeup drawers and bags on a night out.</p>\n                <p>And talk about cute \u2014 students at all schools can fall in love when a package is colorful, appealing and contains a high-quality product.</p>\n                <p>They\u2019re compact and sold in a variety of scents, ranging from fruity to sweet, just like the lip glosses used today.</p>\n                <p>Dark eyeshadow</p>\n                <p>If done correctly, I see no issues with the return of dark eye shadow.</p>\n                <p>The bold look is fun on occasion, especially when adding glitter. A dark eyeshadow color can make your eyes pop and bring your makeup look together.</p>\n                <p>However, brightly colored eye shadow is a different story.</p>\n                <p>Using blue eyeshadow is a little too \u201880s to bring back as a 2016 trend, but the choice is yours in how you want to take advantage of this trend.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "author": "Lexie Linderman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>With just over two months until the NFL draft, preparations are in full swing for the graduating Penn Staters that are hoping to hear their name called at the end of April.</p>\n                <p>A few participated in the Senior Bowl this past week, but none played in the actual game on Saturday, which the American Team won 17-9. They all practiced, however.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a recap of the week for these former Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Nick Singleton, running back</p>\n                <p>Nick Singleton would\u2019ve been one of the highest-drafted running backs last year after a 1,099-yard season, but he opted to return to Penn State for 2025 and use the last of his eligibility.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately for Singleton, his draft stock took a slight tumble. He struggled to start the season and eventually had his playing time reduced to make way for Kaytron Allen, but his athletic abilities remained undeniable as he finished his career as the program leader in career rushing touchdowns, all-purpose yards and total touchdowns.</p>\n                <p>He had a chance to put his athleticism on display at Senior Bowl practice this week, especially impressing during pass protection, but he <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/football/report-penn-state-rb-nick-singleton-breaks-foot-at-senior-bowl-his-father-says/article_fcebedc2-d9f9-4315-a084-3849c9fcd360.html\" target=\"_blank\">broke his foot</a> on Thursday, sidelining him for the foreseeable future and any other pre-draft showcases.</p>\n                <p>ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper has Singleton as the No. 6 running back available, and he\u2019s projected to be a third-round pick.</p>\n                <p>Dani Dennis-Sutton, defensive end</p>\n                <p>The Pinstripe Bowl proved the kind of teammate and player Dani Dennis-Sutton can be in the big leagues, and he took that one step further at the Senior Bowl this week.</p>\n                <p>Dennis-Sutton was impressive throughout a week of practice, although he didn\u2019t participate in the actual game. He won battles with ease and put pressure on opposing quarterbacks while showcasing his athleticism.</p>\n                <p>Dani Dennis-Sutton with a win against Kage Casey <a href=\"https://t.co/sM4kTKtiZZ\">pic.twitter.com/sM4kTKtiZZ</a>&mdash; Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CFBMaxChadwick/status/2016255604151472205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>The defensive end had a slight injury scare and was down on the field for a bit at one point, but he walked off on his own power and appears to have avoided injury.</p>\n                <p>Zakee Wheatley, safety</p>\n                <p>One of Penn State\u2019s best defensive players this season headed to the Senior Bowl to show scouts what he\u2019s made of, and he earned some hardware afterwards.</p>\n                <p>Zakee Wheatley was named the Safety of the Week by his fellow participants and the scouts in attendance, a high honor for the former Nittany Lion that\u2019s one of the top safeties available in the 2026 class.</p>\n                <p>Wheatley measured in at 6-foot-3 and confirmed to reporters that he\u2019ll be at the NFL Scouting Combine at the end of the month.</p>\n                <p>Zane Durant, defensive tackle</p>\n                <p>Zane Durant fell short of the expectation set for him in 2025, much like his team, so he headed to the Senior Bowl to prove he\u2019s still a top defensive tackle available in this year\u2019s NFL draft.</p>\n                <p>Durant seriously impressed throughout Senior Bowl practice, moving right past interior offensive linemen and showcasing his agility and quickness throughout.

Allen is currently ranked as the No. 5 running back available, per ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper.</p>\n                <p>RB Kaytron Allen with the nice cut and burst through the hole, followed by SAF Deshon Singleton flying downhill to make the tackle.

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State was off to a 0-10 start to Big Ten play this season, and the Nittany Lions were shorthanded due to multiple injuries before facing Minnesota on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Despite that, the blue and white managed to pull off a gutsy 77-75 victory over the Golden Gophers courtesy of guard Kayden Mingo\u2019s last-second shot to win. It marked Penn State\u2019s first win over a power-conference opponent this year and ended an eight-game losing streak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's a good sense of relief,\u201d guard Freddie Dilione V said postgame. \u201cGetting our first win in conference is big for us. We just got to carry it over to the next game, and just keep the momentum going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions erupted in celebration after Mingo\u2019s basket. The Bryce Jordan Center crowd was going wild, and at long last to those connected to the program, Penn State picked up a win in Big Ten play this season.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad effort was evident throughout Sunday\u2019s game, which came from a \u201cnext man up\u201d mentality with frontcourt pieces Ivan Juri\u0107, Tibor Mirti\u0107 and Sa\u0161a Ciani all sidelined. Wing Eli Rice also picked up an injury during the game, bringing Penn State\u2019s rotation down to seven scholarship players.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGetting the first win in probably the toughest conference in the country is really big,\u201d Mingo said postgame. \u201cIt could be anybody's game any night, and I feel like we had a lot of people step up tonight, and we can continue to use that moving forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to Sunday\u2019s game, the Nittany Lions' losses ranged from last-second letdowns to blowouts, including last week\u2019s 94-73 loss to Northwestern and the 113-72 defeat to Indiana in December.</p>\n                <p>On the other hand, Penn State took then-No. 2 Michigan down to the buzzer before losing 74-72 on Jan. 6, among other single-digit losses throughout the month of January. Now, the Nittany Lions can say they\u2019ve closed out a win during crunchtime in Big Ten play, even after Minnesota evaporated a 10-point lead late.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's a relief, without a doubt,\u201d Rhoades said postgame. \u201cYou do this long enough, you go through all different emotions and seasons and months. January was not a lot of fun around here. We had stretches of good basketball against good teams, but not good enough to win, and so today was just enough to win.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Even with all the losses Penn State endured, Rhoades typically always praised his players\u2019 response. He\u2019s said they are a \u201cvery coachable\u201d group that\u2019s looking to improve.</p>\n                <p>Following the win over the Golden Gophers, the players have a positive result to build on. Regardless, Rhoades still has the same review regarding his group of guys.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel for them because you have a certain way you want your season to go or your games to go, and when it doesn't go that way, you can always have issues and problems. We don't,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe just got to get better. Today was a little bit of validation that these guys are doing things the right way. I'm really proud of them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Kayden Mingo had the ball at halfcourt during Penn State\u2019s final possession against Minnesota on Sunday. Unbeknownst to him, he was about to make arguably the biggest basket of his young career.</p>\n                <p>The point guard charged down low, pivoted around several times before taking a step into the paint and laying in a game-winning shot to give the Nittany Lions a 77-75 victory over the Golden Gophers. Mingo\u2019s teammates rushed to him in celebration as the Bryce Jordan Center crowd went wild to cap off his strong finish to the game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCoach drew up the play for me, and that was all she wrote from there,\u201d Mingo said postgame. \u201cI got downhill, made sure I played like my coaches teach me, and made a good play. He played good defense, though, as well. It felt great. It felt great having all my teammates going to me, congratulate me, and having their trust and my coaches' trust. I give all the thanks and glory to Jesus Christ and my teammates for being there for me and my coaches for instilling confidence.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo thought on a play before his game-winner that Penn State\u2019s defense would\u2019ve been called for goaltending, which he said would\u2019ve made his squad push the ball down court quickly and try for a fast basket.</p>\n                <p>Instead, Minnesota was shooting free throws before Mingo\u2019s play. Since Golden Gophers forward Langston Reynolds went 1-of-2 at the line, Mike Rhoades told his team to hold the ball for the last 30 seconds to get the last shot, according to Mingo.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades could\u2019ve opted to use guard Freddie Dilione V, who scored a career-high 25 points, on the last possession, but went with Mingo as he felt the freshman star was driving well toward the end of the game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat I was proud about Kayden there is being a freshman guard in that situation,\u201d Rhoades said postgame. \u201cHe didn't panic. He's a strong pivoter. He's a tough kid with the ball.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo didn\u2019t get off to a fast start in Sunday\u2019s game. In fact, he was held to just two points in the first half and was shooting 1-of-9 to begin the contest.</p>\n                <p>However, around the midway point of the second half, Mingo made back-to-back layups to get going. He finished the game off with 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals with 6-of-17 shooting in 37 minutes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like once my teammates started to make more and more shots, it started to open up and I came out a little bit more aggressive in the second half,\u201d Mingo said.</p>\n                <p>Mingo also had multiple key baskets before his clutch shot at the end of the game. At the 8:39 mark of the second half, he sank a 3-pointer to give Penn State a 63-58 lead, and he made a layup with 49 seconds left to generate a 75-72 advantage for his squad.</p>\n                <p>At local media day back in October, Mingo said he\u2019s \u201ca winner before anything.\u201d He had poise throughout the crunch time of the Nittany Lions' victory over Minnesota, showcasing that mentality.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's so electric and quick getting downhill,\u201d Minnesota head coach Niko Medved said postgame. \u201cHe plays with such balance, too. He's able to get by guys, and he plays on balance. He can play off at two feet. He uses his pivots well. He's an aggressive, attacking kid. He's got a really, really bright future.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Elliott Inscho | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Hunter Aquino ended 2025 by being named a second-team Inside Lacrosse All-American, and he showed why he was deserving of that honor in the first game of his 2026 campaign.</p>\n                <p>Aquino, the reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year, scored five goals in Holuba Hall en route to an 18-14 victory for Penn State on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>That mark set a new career high for the sophomore out of Easton, Pennsylvania. His prior best-of-three came against Princeton last season, another game that was played indoors.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that comes out every day,\u201d coach Jeff Tambroni said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a moment, whether it\u2019s a practice or a game, where you\u2019re going to see a change in his attitude [or] his confidence.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That confidence was paramount to Aquino\u2019s strong showing on Sunday. To go along with his goals, he recorded an assist and two ground balls, capping a solid all-around performance.</p>\n                <p>Last season, most of Aquino\u2019s reps came as a midfielder, but after the departure of Matt Traynor from the attack line, Tambroni dropped the 6-foot-5 star down to replace the PLL-bound Traynor in 2026.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s still learning how to play the position,\u201d Tambroni said. \u201cYou have to learn it through the course of the season. It\u2019s a hard position to play. He\u2019s the catalyst of things that are going on on the offensive end.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Early returns suggest that the change worked for both Aquino and the Nittany Lions as a whole. His six points in his attack debut were the most by any Penn State player.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(I was) definitely a little bit nervous,\u201d Aquino said, \u201cWhen I shot the ball into the goalie\u2019s stick, (my teammates) said \u2018keep shooting, keep shooting.\u2019 Just having that trust from them makes my job so much easier.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Aquino\u2019s season-opener was strong, there will be bigger challenges ahead for the sophomore. Tambroni noted that while he put in a good performance on Sunday, there\u2019s still a lot to learn for the preseason Big Ten Player to Watch.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe has to be in different situations,\u201d Tambroni said, \u201cand learn how to manage when we\u2019re down, when we\u2019re up, tighter situations, all situations. Throughout the course of the year, we\u2019ll learn a lot more about this.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Not only was Aquino strong, but the entire offense\u2019s chemistry was clearly on display in the victory over Colgate, with ten different players recording a goal for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Aquino was one of three Penn State players with a hat trick, to go along with fellow attackman Kyle Lehman and redshirt senior Michael Faraone.</p>\n                <p>The attack unit specifically was strong in the victory, combining for nine goals and 14 total points. Despite Liam Matthews, who recorded 34 points in 2025, being sidelined with an injury, the unit seemed comfortable with one another.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe love this group,\u201d Aquino said. \u201cWe love getting to know each other. The freshman, (Jack) Iannantuono, is an unbelievable player. Lehman is one of the best attackmen in the country. It\u2019s just so easy to play with them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The losers of its last eight consecutive games, Penn State entered its matchup against Minnesota with one goal: pick up its first conference win.</p>\n                <p>A Big Ten win has been evasive for the Nittany Lions this season, but the blue and white finally put it together against the Golden Gophers, picking up a 77-75 buzzer-beating win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief, without a doubt,\u201d Mike Rhoades said about the win. \u201cJanuary wasn\u2019t fun around here. We had stretches of good basketball against good teams, but not big enough, not experienced enough, good enough to win. Today was just enough to win\u2026 Today was a little bit of validation that these guys are doing things the right way.</p>\n                <p>Penn State missed out on getting the opening points after a Dominick Stewart three-pointer wouldn\u2019t fall, leading to Minnesota\u2019s leading scorer, Cade Tyson getting fouled on the fast break and converting from the charity stripe to strike first.</p>\n                <p>The two sides were trading points in the early running but the Nittany Lions were pulling ahead thanks to Freddie Dilione V and Josh Reed scoring in bunches on their way to a 15-9 lead.</p>\n                <p>Dilione capped off the day matching his career-high of 25 points while Reed finished with 18 points, just one point away from tying his career-high of 19.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThose two guys have all the experience\u2026 Josh is an awesome young man. He\u2019s a really good teammate. He cares about people\u2026 since he got here in June he took the team out to eat multiple times on his dime. Who does that? Being a good teammate and taking care of your teammates and the young guys, that\u2019s important to him\u2026 and he\u2019s having the best individual season he\u2019s ever had,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cFreddie can make plays\u2026 he played defense, he had five rebounds. He was in some scuffles going after the ball today\u2026 we need a dirty Freddie.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A Justin Houser basket off the assist by Kayden Mingo gave the blue and white a five point lead before Minnesota coach Niko Medved called timeout.</p>\n                <p>In basketball, a \u201ckill\u201d is when a team forces three consecutive defensive stops. Minnesota had been unable to get a kill at the six-minute media timeout, a large reason Penn State had been so successful on offense to that point.</p>\n                <p>As Dilione notched his 13th point, the Nittany Lions captured a 10 point lead and looked just about as good as they have all season with a 31-21 advantage.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions missed out on extending their lead to 15 points, unable to get anything to fall for a couple of possessions until a Reed three-pointer made it a 39-29 ballgame with just over a minute remaining in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took to the locker room at the half holding a 41-31 lead backed by Reed\u2019s 16 points and Dilione\u2019s 13. Reed looked like he was on pace for setting a new career-high if he and the Nittany Lions could keep running an offensive clinic in the second half.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHaving them both as role models and leaders beside me, it\u2019s really good playing with them,\u201d Mingo said about his teammates. \u201cEspecially when both of them are playing very well and scoring the ball at a high clip.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Minnesota again got the scoring started to kick off the second half after a Tyson pull-up jumper, but Dilione responded back and kept the lead right where it was. The Golden Gophers\u2019 leading scorer went up to 11 points on the day after that bucket.</p>\n                <p>Stewart had a nice finish with contact to make his bucket an and-one as Penn State made its lead 10 points again, but Minnesota\u2019s rebound leader, Jaylen Crocker-Johnson matched the score after being held to just four points in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota was really carving away at the Nittany Lion lead with a big-time slam from Langston Reynolds and an Isaac Asuma three-pointer that cut his squad\u2019s deficit to 50-42.</p>\n                <p>Eli Rice took a big hit to the head after another Reynolds bucket and had to exit the game and go to the locker room, questionable to return.</p>\n                <p>After losing Rice, Penn State was losing its lead too.</p>\n                <p>A Grayson Grove jam meant the Golden Gophers were stepping on the heels of the Nittany Lions, cutting the lead to just 55-53. Some chippiness followed, but the blue and white were holding onto its lead for the time being.</p>\n                <p>Mingo\u2019s first three-pointer of the day couldn\u2019t have come at a better time as his effort gave Penn State a little more wiggle room, with a narrow 63-58 lead with just about eight minutes left to play.</p>\n                <p>An unsuccessful Minnesota coach\u2019s challenge regarding a block that followed gave the Nittany Lions even more wiggle room as they got the ball back and capitalized with an easy Stewart bucket.</p>\n                <p>Reed moved just one point away from his career-high mark of 19 after a fadeaway bucket which extended the blue and white lead to 71-61 with three minutes left to play.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back scores from Dilione and Mingo made it a 75-72 ballgame with 40 seconds left in the game after Minnesota was breathing down Penn State\u2019s neck, going on a 9-0 scoring run to erase its deficit and get closer to stealing a win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was pissed at the way we were handling pressure,\u201d Rhoades said about Minnesota closing in. \u201cWe were fatigued. We were tired. We were really slow throwing it inbounds.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A Reynolds layup off the fast break gave the Golden Gophers a 76-75 lead with 30 seconds left on the clock for their first lead since the beginning of the game, but a foul took away the score, and Reynolds instead shot two from the free throw, making just one to turn it into a 75-75 game.</p>\n                <p>On the last possession of the game, Mingo fought his way to the hoop for an improbable bucket with just a second left on the clock to seal the deal and escape with the 77-75 victory.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Tibor Mirti\u010d, who has been dealing with a knee injury, was listed as \u201cout\u201d against Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTibor came back from his knee and, in practice, hurt his shoulder his first day back,\u201d Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Big men Ivan Juri\u0107 and Sa\u0161a Ciani were both listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d with undisclosed injuries entering Sunday\u2019s match and did not see any action.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSa\u0161a hurt his ankle,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIvan was sick as a dog this morning.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday when it heads to Ann Arbor to take on No. 3 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>The Wolverines won their last matchup with the Nittany Lions in the Bryce Jordan Center at the beginning of January, squeaking out a 74-72 victory.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Coming off a massive 197.000+ victory last week, Penn State traveled to Piscataway, New Jersey, to try to repeat that performance against a typical Big Ten foe.</p>\n                <p>Despite being unable to match last week\u2019s huge 197.250, the Nittany Lions still hit 49.000+ on each event to beat Rutgers 196.375-194.575.</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>Ellie Monahan started the rotation with a few small mistakes, which lowered her score to a 9.775. She was short on a few handstands and took a small on her full twisting double back.</p>\n                <p>Jessica Johanson\u2019s routine was really strong on the bars. She caught her reverse hecht a little close, but she also had a small hop back on her double layout for a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Small hop on double layout.</p>\n                <p>Elizabeth Leary was strong on the bar. She held on to a close handstand at the end of her routine. Her biggest deductions came from not just a small hop back on her dismount but also a small step after, for a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>The freshman Ava Cash had a beautiful routine. She showcased her long lines with perfect handstands throughout and had great distance on her piked Jaeger. However, like her teammates, she had a small shuffle back on her double back for a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>Ava Peidrahita scored a low 9.400 because her start value was lowered after she missed her Maloney to Pak Salto combination. She needed an extra swing and took a hop on her dismount.</p>\n                <p>Dani Latronica got the team back on track in a huge way with an event-winning 9.925 and a great stuck landing. Penn State took the lead 49.200-48.825.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Leary opened the rotation with a full twisting Yurchenko. She had a larger than .100 hop, lowering her score to a 9.750. Cash followed up with her own Yurchenko full. She had massive height and just a small hop back for a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Allison Kaempfer with her big 10.0 start value Yurchenko 1.5. She was slightly underrotated and had to take a hop back, lowering her score to 9.750. Latronica followed with a strong Yurchenko, taking just a small hop for a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Johanson followed up with a similar performance and a 9.800 of her own after just a hop on the landing. Piedrahita, after her mistake on bars, bounced back in a big way with an event-winning 9.925. Penn State widens its lead over Rutgers 98.325-97.575</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>The floor was Penn State\u2019s lowest scoring event of the day, coming in at just 49.025. Leary led off with a strong 9.850 after controlling each of her passes. Monahan followed up with a similar routine, scoring a 9.800. She stuck her second pass cold.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Maul started her routine off with a strong double back, but was short on her second pass, ultimately sitting her front layout down. She scored only a 9.000, putting pressure on the remaining gymnasts to hit.</p>\n                <p>Bella Misiura got the team back on track with a 9.775. She had some form issues in her front double full and took a slightly uncontrolled step forward, but stuck her final pass cold. Alyssa Kramer had a similar routine with her front double full and solid final pass for a 9.750.</p>\n                <p>Kalea McElligott closed out the rotation much like it began, with a 9.850. She had too much power on her opening double back and had to move her front foot back as well in her lunge, but had a strong one-and-a-half to front layout to finish.</p>\n                <p>Penn State remained ahead of Rutgers 147.350-145.975 as Rutgers struggled to score 49.000+ on any rotation.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Monahan, coming off last week\u2019s career high, was unable to replicate that performance, scoring a 9.775 to start off the rotation. She had a strong acro combination, but was a little unsteady on her full turn. She took a hop forward on her dismount and drifted to the side.</p>\n                <p>Leary began the string of triple series for Penn State but took a balance check at the end. She also needed a balance check on her full turn. She managed to hold on to her stuck dismount but scored a low 9.625.</p>\n                <p>Maul nailed her triple acro series and showcased complete control throughout her routine. She stuck her dismount for a big 9.875 in the third spot. She matched her career high.</p>\n                <p>McElligott started her routine with a clean triple series. Her back leg was a little off on her leap series, and she took a small hop on her dismount for a 9.750.</p>\n                <p>Kramer had an extremely solid routine. She was a little slow to make her leap connection but had virtually no wobbles throughout her routine. She stuck her dismount to follow up last week\u2019s career high with just a slightly lower 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Latronica anchored the rotation with a 9.800. She needed to circle her arms twice after her acro series, which was a bit of a wobble, but had a strong rest of the routine, including a stuck gainer full off the side.</p>\n                <p>Penn State scored the same as the floor for a 49.025 as Rutgers struggled in its final rotation, having to count a 9.550.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State heads for the big SEC stage as it takes on LSU in Baton Rouge at 7:30 p.m. Friday.</p>\n                <p>MOIRE GYMNASTICS CONTENT</p>",

True freshman Preston Hawkins originally started the game but allowed five goals while only making a single save before being replaced by redshirt freshman Hayes Schreiner, who made four saves on 14 shots.</p>\n                <p>On the opposite end of the field, Andrew Lehrman had a better showing despite the high-scoring defeat. He made 15 saves on 33 shots, stopping many dangerous opportunities along the way.</p>\n                <p>Hunter Aquino, the reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year, Kyle Lehman and Michael Faraone each scored hat-tricks in their season debuts. Aquino ended the contest with four goals and two assists, Lehman scored three and assisted on a pair and Faraone tallied three goals and an assist.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe love this group,\u201d Aquino said. \u201cWe love getting to know each other, having (Iannantuono) an unbelievable player and (Lehman) is one of the best attackmen in the country.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Aquino, formerly a midfielder last season, moved up to the attack position as Matt Traynor was drafted by the New York Atlas of the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL). His first game up front appeared to make no difference to his ability to put points on the board.</p>\n                <p>Luke Walstrum and Patrick Carragher also had breakout performances, each scoring a pair of goals to shake up the usual gameplan of utilizing Aquino\u2019s lethal shot. They were backed up by four different scorers who added additional attacking depth \u2014 Andrew Beard, Jack Iannantuono, Ryan DiRocco and Chase Robertson.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe don't have one single guy that can't get it done,\u201d Aquino said. \u201cSo we put faith in them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Casey Quinson was Colgate\u2019s leading scorer with a hat trick of his own. He was followed by Hunter Drouin, Freddy Fowler and Quinn Spillett, each with a pair. The Raiders also had five other players add their names to the scoreboard.</p>\n                <p>Penn State dominated on the face-off dot, winning 24-11. Tambroni ran a two-player system, utilizing both Colby Baldwin and Reid Gills to win the majority of battles over Fischer Burke and Kyle Rummel. Aquino appeared once on the dot and won his single opportunity.</p>\n                <p>\u201cColby, Reid and their wings have done an exceptional job thus far,\u201d Tambroni said. \u201cIt's what we'd hoped and expected going into the game, not in any disrespect to Colgate, but they've just come in and worked so hard every day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Early in the second quarter, Colgate surged on both sides of the ball, resulting in its first lead of the game after a five-goal swing. Spillett got the Raiders in motion with a bounce shot that evaded Hawkins\u2019 stick.</p>\n                <p>Then, after Lehrman made a save on Aquino\u2019s dangerous chance, no Nittany Lion defender slid to Andy Croddick as he freely scored to take a 4-3 lead. On the next possession, Fowler compounded Penn State\u2019s woes with a side-arm shot to extend the gap to two.</p>\n                <p>This was when Tambroni put Schreiner in the cage and the switch appeared to spark Penn State to life. The move kick-started a four-goal swing that resulted in the Nittany Lions maintaining a healthy lead through the remainder of the game.</p>\n                <p>Once Penn State regained its prior three-goal advantage in the third quarter, 12-9, it didn\u2019t drop below that threshold despite consistent pressure from Colgate\u2019s attack and 10-man ride strategy.</p>\n                <p>A series of timeouts called by both teams slowed the pace of play considerably late in the fourth quarter as the Raiders attempted to mount a comeback. However, Penn State held on for the 18-14 victory.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to Panzer Stadium to face Villanova at 1 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Attackman Liam Matthews wasn\u2019t dressed for the game, although he was seen alongside his teammates on the sidelines.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Fink breaks scoring drought, nets two goals for No. 5 Penn State men's hockey at Beaver Stadium",
    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Aiden Fink was named Penn State\u2019s MVP last season, and for good reason. The shifty forward led the Nittany Lions with 53 points, 30 goals and 23 assists.</p>\n                <p>That scoring production had evaded Fink, who\u2019s missed seven games due to injury this season, for the better part of the 2025-26 campaign. But even after Fink\u2019s scoring drought extended to seven games in No. 5 Penn State\u2019s 6-3 loss to No. 2 Michigan State on Friday, coach Guy Gadowsky remained unbothered.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky said Fink had actually played \u201cvery well\u201d in several areas and that he had no doubt his offensive production would return. Fink made good on his coach\u2019s confidence, netting two goals in the Nittany Lions\u2019 5-4 overtime loss to the Spartans on Saturday at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought it was great,\u201d Fink said of scoring his first Big Ten goal of the season. \u201cIt's just good to be back from injury \u2026 It was very cool scoring in that environment.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Michigan State earned a 17-10 edge in shots on goal to take a 1-0 lead into the first intermission. Penn State\u2019s offense craved a spark, which Fink delivered 13 seconds into the second period.</p>\n                <p>The Nashville Predators prospect dribbled down the far boards before utilizing a nifty hesitation move to blow past an off-balance Spartans defender. Fink skated into space and wristed one far side to send Beaver Stadium into a madhouse.</p>\n                <p>Who else, but Aiden Fink!! \ud83d\ude24<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAre?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeAre</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HockeyValley?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HockeyValley</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FpFPD92wZZ\">pic.twitter.com/FpFPD92wZZ</a>&mdash; Penn State Men\u2019s Hockey (@PennStateMHKY) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennStateMHKY/status/2017680011508019320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 31, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>It marked Penn State\u2019s first-ever goal at Beaver Stadium. But more importantly, it marked a breakthrough moment for the junior forward, who scored his first goal since Jan. 4.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSeeing that whole stadium packed, skating out to that blue line (during player introductions), it was the coolest moment ever,\u201d Fink said.</p>\n                <p>Fink wasn\u2019t done there. With the contest tied 2-2 toward the end of the second period, Gavin McKenna dribbled behind Michigan State\u2019s goal, eyeing his third point of the game.</p>\n                <p>Like the duo did 16 minutes earlier, McKenna fed Fink, this time with time and space in the slot. And the veteran forward converted, one-timing a snap shot past Trey Augustine\u2019s outstretched glove to give Penn State a 3-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>72 \u27a1\ufe0f 18 \u27a1\ufe0f GOAL<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAre?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeAre</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HockeyValley?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HockeyValley</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iiNBqBT1Zr\">pic.twitter.com/iiNBqBT1Zr</a>&mdash; Penn State Men\u2019s Hockey (@PennStateMHKY) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennStateMHKY/status/2017688402720612835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 31, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>\u201c(Fink) is a very smart player. You want to get the puck on his stick,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cHe can obviously put the puck in the back of the net, and he can skate like the wind. So whenever I can get the puck to him, if I ever see him open, I know something's going to happen, and I always have to be ready for a play he's going to make.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State later fell in overtime, their fourth loss in four tries against Michigan State this season. In front of 74,575 raucous fans, it was a demoralizing defeat for a team that had come so close to earning a signature victory.</p>\n                <p>But the team\u2019s 2024-25 MVP, who\u2019s battled through injury and tough bounces for much of this season, finally found his stride. And for that, Gadowsky left Beaver Stadium with something.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSince (Fink) came back from a broken thumb, he's done so much for the team,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe's back-checked, he\u2019s been so supportive of his teammates. I love seeing him have offensive success right now, because I know he's not focused on that. He's focused on trying to get this team to win as much as he can. And it's really showing through. He's as good a leader as I've ever seen him be.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Steven Pavelka | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State senior defenseman Kendall Butze stepped up big Saturday, assisting on two goals in the blue and white\u2019s 5\u20132 win over Robert Morris. With the first helper, Butze set the program record for most points for a defenseman (85).</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Butze)\u2019s an amazing player and also an amazing person, so everyone was so happy when she got it, I wouldn't want anyone else to get it,\u201d Forward Mya Vaslet said postgame. \u201cObviously, she's leaving her jersey in a better place than when she found it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Cleveland, Ohio, native got her first assist late in the second period to help freshman defenseman Danica Maynard score and put Penn State up by two points. She got her second assist in the third period when senior forward Katelyn Roberts scored the game-sealing 5th goal in the evening.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe's honestly a great role model, especially on the defensive side. She communicates a lot, and she's always positive on the bench,\u201d Maynard said postgame. \u201cShe's a two-way player, so being able to get her points and the stuff that she does, but also defend, I think she's just like an all-around player, and super fun to watch.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Nicole Hall, Tessa Janecke, and Matilde Fantin being in Italy for the Olympics, Penn State needed someone to step up, and that is exactly what Butze did against the Colonials after the team started with a 2-0 deficit.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can always rely on her for any situation,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cLike a five on three and we're penalty kill, or if it's a six on five and we are down one and we need an extra player on, we'll put her on. She's a very 200-foot player; she's someone who you can rely on all the time.\u201d\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite the slow start to the game, Penn State eventually found its stride and hit the ground running, with that unbenign beginning to the game becoming a nonfactor.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI do think their mindset was good,\u201d Coach Jeff Kampersal said,\u201d things like work against us. But again, this group. I don't worry about it all.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kampersal continued to praise his players' preparedness and their willingness to do whatever it takes to win. He also credited the depth of the team, a season-long sentiment, saying that they have a lot of players who are able to fill in and do a lot of things well.</p>\n                <p>Butze continues to impress down the stretch, as she had her best game of the season a week earlier against Delaware, in which she had three assists and scored a goal. She is on track to score a personal record for most points in a season, beating the 27 she had in the 2024-2025 season.</p>\n                <p>With the postseason quickly approaching and a milestone-filled regular season coming to an end, the white and blue will continue to lean on their veteran leadership to win games. Butze will continue to be a key contributor as the team faces tougher opponents and her teammates need someone to rely on.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State\u2019s final series against Robert Morris not only included the first outdoor hockey game at Beaver Stadium, but the first series without three forwards who have been excelling this season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions quickly trailed 2-0 in Game 2 against the Colonials. This was a deficit seemingly uncommon for Penn State, and one that some would think an intermission speech could quickly solve. However, it wasn\u2019t a speech that mounted a comeback; it was belief inside the team that led to five unanswered goals and a 5-2 victory.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis group can self-motivate. They know when they\u2019re doing well,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said. \u201cThey know when they need to pick it up also.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The blue and white showed its self-belief every second after letting up the early goal in the second period. With continuous communication throughout the lines and aggressive forechecking, the Nittany Lions were able to develop scoring opportunities.</p>\n                <p>Mya Vaslet was a part of the surge of offense as she recorded two assists in the game. The graduate student knew that it only took one goal to get the ball rolling.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo one really has to say anything with this group, it\u2019s kind of like let\u2019s go out there and let\u2019s pick it up,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cIt\u2019s always like let\u2019s have a good response and then obviously Grace Outwater had a nice goal and kind of got everyone going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State was able to cap off a historic weekend with a comeback win without Tessa Janecke, Nicole Hall and Matilde Fantin. The three forwards are currently in Milan, Italy for the Winter Olympic Games. Thus leaving Kampersal to adjust his starting lines.</p>\n                <p>Throughout the season, the Nittany Lions have played games without either one of the three players. However, losing all three at once could leave a larger impact heading into the backend of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEvery single person in the lineup can play, and they are all good at something. Everybody can contribute,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cIf we are down one, two or three (players) we\u2019re good. Obviously, we want everybody back, and we can handle maybe a longer run in the playoffs with everybody back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions played with only three lines instead of four due to the absence of the forwards. A potential factor that could lead to tired skaters on the ice. However, signs of any effect have only been in the right direction thus far.</p>\n                <p>Kampersal\u2019s statement rings true, not only throughout the coaching staff, but the players as well. For Danica Maynard, she believes that the team\u2019s culture is what has been driving them in the last couple of games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more of the culture within our team. I think everyone knows we have to keep battling and keep playing our game,\u201d Maynard said. \u201cObviously, with the three that are gone, they\u2019re amazing, but we have a tight-knit group within as well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Regardless, he made a statement \u2014 he\u2019s going to show up when the lights are the brightest.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI mean, every game, you want to be at your best,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cIt was obviously a big game. A lot of eyes (were) on this game and I thought our team played well. Obviously not the result we wanted. I thought it was a great experience.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McKenna is no stranger to taking his game to the next level when his team needs him the most. In last season\u2019s WHL playoffs with the Medicine Hat Tigers, he posted 38 points, nine goals and 29 assists. While the numbers look great by themself, they really catch eyes when seen that he did that in only 16 games.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s a 2.375 points-per-game pace in a physical, have-to-have-it style of hockey.</p>\n                <p>But what might be more impressive is his attitude. Guy Gadowsky said that McKenna is a for-the-team player, which says levels about the actual person he is.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s no secret McKenna is getting paid big bucks to play at Penn State. It\u2019s also no secret he\u2019s likely one-and-done and into the NHL next year as the likely No. 1 overall pick.</p>\n                <p>Yet, he\u2019s not cocky or arrogant. He genuinely wants to help the team succeed.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWell, I tell you what, there's so much that very justifiably is recognized and written about his talent, and it should be, because it's incredible,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHowever, the more I get to be around Gavin, the thing that I love the most is he is so for this team and I can tell you, he loves being on Penn State campus. He loves being a part of this, and he wants very badly to be a part of it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Saturday showed just how much he\u2019s actually bought into Penn State. McKenna said he blacked out after his goal in the second period, and during it, he showed about as much emotion as he ever has while donning the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>He said he realized how special and amazing the game was going to be while walking through the tunnel and fist-bumping Penn State football players as he made his way towards the ice. He was truly bought into the moment and the opportunity at hand.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's been pretty unbelievable,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI'll forever be grateful for what we got here at Penn State. Yeah, this game, it was special. The amount of effort people put into this game for us, people traveling in to come watch us play, it was special. And, yeah, to just be part of this community at Penn State, I'm forever at Penn Stater, and that was an amazing time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Despite a heartbreaking overtime loss to No. 2 Michigan State on Saturday, Penn State captain Dane Dowiak left the Beaver Stadium field, turned ice rink, with a belief: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t be prouder to be a Penn Stater.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The sports culture the blue and white have developed is first-class, and when 74,575 fans showed up in 15-degree weather for the first-ever outdoor hockey game at Beaver Stadium, that sentiment was all the more evident.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to feel negative because of the loss, because this was such an amazing experience,\u201d Guy Gadowsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s so incredible to be a part of an institution that supports something like this so well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Penn State community has rallied around the production of this event for months, and on Saturday, it officially became the second-highest attended outdoor college hockey game of all time, and put it among the top 10 highest attended hockey games at any level.</p>\n                <p>The electric atmosphere was evident from the moment the Nittany Lions made their entrance out of the student section gates to a roaring crowd and a tunnel of fellow Penn State athletes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWalking through those gates was pretty special,\u201d star freshman Gavin McKenna said. \u201cWalking through (all the athletes), fist-bumping them all, the crowd, it was amazing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Spartans managed to subdue the crowd less than three minutes in when forward Daniel Russell opened the scoring, but the passion never went away.</p>\n                <p>The spark in Beaver Stadium was reignited when, less than 15 seconds into the second period, forward Aiden Fink skated around a defender and rang a shot off the top crossbar and past goaltender Trey Augustine.</p>\n                <p>The lead was quickly taken back by the Spartans, however, after Charlie Stramel fired home a rebound out in front of Penn State\u2019s netminder Kevin Reidler.</p>\n                <p>Despite the quick goal by Michigan State, the blue and white maintained most of the momentum, backed by the raucous Roar Zone, and were rewarded for it less than five minutes later.</p>\n                <p>McKenna received a centering pass from Mac Gadowsky and sent the shot into the back of the Spartans' net, jumping into the glass and blowing the metaphorical roof off the stadium.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI kind of blacked out on that one,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI think just the emotions in that game, obviously with the crowd, the atmosphere, how tight of a game it was, it was pretty easy to get excited like that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Two more goals were exchanged \u2014 one from Fink and one from Stramel \u2014 to send the Nittany Lions into the final period locked in a 3-3 battle.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Shea Van Olm was the hero in Hockey Valley, with a highlight reel goal just four minutes into the third frame. After stripping the puck from a Spartan and beating another in a foot race, the forward sent a shot to the top corner of Augustine\u2019s net and gave Penn State its first lead of the day.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white had all of three minutes to enjoy its lead, before Matt Basgall\u2019s shot from the point made its way through traffic and into Reidler\u2019s net.</p>\n                <p>Neither team found another score through the final 10 minutes of the period, and Beaver Stadium and all of its 75,000 fans were sent to overtime.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like Beaver Stadium, like I know that now,\u201d Dowiak said. \u201cThat was the coolest environment I\u2019ll ever play in my life, no matter if I make the NHL or not.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite the deafening stadium and some good chances, the blue and white fell to the Spartans 5-4 about three minutes into the overtime period, when Stramel\u2019s game-winning goal completed his hat-trick and collected the weekend sweep.</p>\n                <p>While a series sweep always stings, the Penn State community gave plenty of reason for Guy Gadowsky\u2019s unit to walk away with gratitude.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNone of us, the players especially, will ever forget this experience,\u201d Guy Gadowsky said. \u201cIt was incredible, and Penn State is incredible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey returned to Pegula Ice Arena at 6 p.m. Saturday to close a two-game series against Robert Morris following the program\u2019s first victory at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions battled back from an early two-goal deficit with five unanswered goals to secure the Winter Weekend sweep over the Colonials with a final score of 5-2. The blue and white improved to 26-4 on the season, 18-1 in the AHA.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe start wasn't ideal,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said. \u201cWe're definitely ready to play, but we gifted two goals there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>First period</p>\n                <p>Penn State faced early disciplinary action in the first period as Leah Stecker was called for cross checking and Abby Stonehouse was caught for a delay of game penalty, giving the Colonials a 5-on-3 advantage. During the penalty kill, Robert Morris\u2019 Taylor Storey took a trip to the sin bin for hooking.</p>\n                <p>Once the teams were settled at even-strength, Storey took little time to get the Colonials on the board.</p>\n                <p>Sophie Morrow mishandled a pass on her attacking blue line and gave Storey a breakaway on goaltender Katie DeSa. Storey toe-dragged on her forehand and lifted the puck over DeSa\u2019s shoulder into the top right corner of the net to open the scoring exactly ten minutes into the first period.</p>\n                <p>The teams once again traded opportunities on the power play. Both McKenna Walsh and Mya Kearns took tripping minors, but both penalties were routinely cleared by the special teams units. Later, a five-minute major was assessed to Linnea Misner for checking from behind.</p>\n                <p>While on the power play, Danica Maynard put a shot on net that Grace Outwater followed up by crashing the net. Although the puck slid past goaltender Maggie Hatch and passed the goal line, the officials blew their whistles before it crossed and later deemed it a no-goal.</p>\n                <p>Second period</p>\n                <p>Rowyn Ringor wasted no time increasing the gap, despite being shorthanded. She maneuvered into the slot and ripped a wrist shot off the iron and into the back of the net to take a 2-0 lead only 14 seconds into the second period.</p>\n                <p>Outwater responded 19 seconds later. The Picton, Ontario, native blazed down the right side boards and chose to shoot short-side. Her shot landed under Hatch\u2019s glove and squeaked past the goal line to bring Penn State within one.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was hugely important that we scored right away, and that kickstarted us into motion,\u201d Kampersal said.</p>\n                <p>Stonehouse continued the scoring surge just over two-and-a-half minutes into the frame from the same spot as Outwater. She shot cross-body into the hole over Hatch\u2019s blocker-side shoulder to tie the game at 2-2.</p>\n                <p>Walsh, who scored the game-winning goal at Beaver Stadium, scored the blue and white\u2019s third unanswered goal with 10:56 remaining in the second period to take a 3-2 lead. She won the race to a breakaway before making a swift move to her backhand, sliding the puck past Hatch\u2019s extended skate.</p>\n                <p>Maynard joined the scoring after performing a spin move in the slot to get into position for a wrist shot that found a way past Hatch\u2019s pad. Penn State went into the second intermission up by a pair of goals.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I got in there, I knew that (Mya Vaslet) was in front and she was screaming, so I threw it to the net and it got in,\u201d Maynard said.</p>\n                <p>Kendall Butze was awarded the primary assist on Maynard\u2019s goal, her 85th career point, which officially set the program record for most career points by a defenseman. The senior already holds the program record for most assists by a defenseman with 71.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEveryone was so happy when (Butze) got it,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cI wouldn't want anyone else to get it. And she's leaving her jersey in a better place than when she found it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Third period</p>\n                <p>Leah Stecker was given a five-minute major for cross checking with 16:28 remaining in the game, after a lengthy video review. Although the Colonials struck the crossbar, Penn State emerged without conceding.</p>\n                <p>Katelyn Roberts brought energy back to Pegula Ice Arena after an extended period of back-and-forth play through the neutral zone. Butze fired a shot that trickled through Hatch\u2019s pads \u2014 and while it sat on the goal-line \u2014 Roberts lurked nearby to tap the puck in.</p>\n                <p>Hatch was subsequently replaced in-net by sophomore Lucy Phillips. The new netminder was quickly thrust into action as Catriona Crarer was assessed a game misconduct for head contact.</p>\n                <p>Then, Kaitlyn Schooley took a slashing minor, allowing Penn State to close the remainder of the game on the power play.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State is set to face Lindenwood in Maryland Heights, Missouri, at 5 p.m. Friday and 2 p.m. Saturday.</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When Guy Gadowsky took over as head coach of Penn State men\u2019s hockey, the program was housed in the lowly Greenberg Ice Pavilion. A complex that resembles a community rink with a ceiling lower than most of the classrooms at University Park. Yet from the moment he got the job, Gadowsky strived for bigger surroundings.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think the day I got hired, the question was \u2018when are you guys gonna play a hockey game at Beaver Stadium?\u2019\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was possible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the program grew, so did the stages they played in. From the Greenberg to the Pegula Ice Arena, to NHL arenas for specialty games and the Frozen Four, all leading up to Saturday afternoon. 74,575 fans packed into Beaver Stadium, all clad in blue and white, supporting a program that hadn\u2019t joined the NCAA until 15 years ago.</p>\n                <p>Days before the game, Gadowsky couldn\u2019t yet imagine what the scene would look like in front of a sea of hockey fans.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is going to be new, and it\u2019s certainly going to feel new,\u201d Gadowsky said prior to the game. \u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s going to be cold on the bench.\u201d</p>\n                <p>When Gadowsky first visited the stadium on Wednesday, the gratitude finally sank in. The coach reflected on a decade and a half of success, fronted by Terry Pegula and his place in the program into perspective.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to everyone who started this program and everyone who\u2019s gotten success,\" Gadowsky said. \u201cI don\u2019t think (Pegula) ever thought it\u2019d hit 75,000, but I know he\u2019s very proud.\u201d</p>\n                <p>When the weekend finally came, Gadowsky led his squad in front of a crowd that had only been topped once in the history of college hockey. They walked through the hallowed gates that have become synonymous with fall nights in Pennsylvania as fireworks shot out hundreds of feet above their skates. The stadium shook as the crowd, who weren\u2019t stuck in traffic, made up for the noise of the late arrivals.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like Beaver Stadium, and I know that now,\u201d Penn State captain Dane Dowiak said. \u201cThat was the coolest environment I will ever play in in my life, no matter if I make the NHL or not.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the players made their slow walk into frigid temperatures, representatives of other NCAA teams lined the entryway to greet them. When they lined up for the player introductions, it became clear the Roar Zone had traveled well on its journey across Curtin Road. Every time a Spartan\u2019s name was mentioned, half of the stadium overpowered the PA system with the word \u201cSUCKS\u201d louder than the 1/12th capacity of Pegula Ice Arena could scientifically muster.</p>\n                <p>Then the Nittany Lions got their chance to be introduced, creating a lifetime memory as the crowd roared at each name and picture on the jumbotrons.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust seeing that whole stadium packed, skating out to the blue line with your name called, it was the coolest moment ever.\u201d Aiden Fink said.</p>\n                <p>The loudest ovation came for McKenna. If there\u2019s one player in the NCAA who could imagine playing in a game more grandiose than Saturday, it\u2019s him. The expected first-overall NHL draft pick now has a memory that will be hard to top without involving a Stanley Cup over his head. McKenna expressed what being a Nittany Lion means to him after a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ll forever be grateful for what we\u2019ve got here at Penn State,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cThis game was special; I\u2019m forever a Penn Stater.\u201d</p>\n                <p>When the game started, the crowd stayed hot, singing the classic Penn State hockey chants and the football traditions that are commonplace at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>Even though the Spartans silenced the energy in the first with a goal, the energy that returned when Fink potted the Nittany Lions\u2019 first goal nearly brought down the west stadium construction site. As fireworks shot off, Fink was dogpiled by teammates while over 70,000 fans jumped and sang along to Kernkraft.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was one of those moments where you just look around and take it in,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it was for hockey, it\u2019s very humbling, honestly.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After the game, despite the loss, Gadowsky couldn\u2019t help but reflect on the experience with gratitude. He took the football coach's seat in the Beaver Stadium press room, holding back tears as he thanked everyone involved with making his dream for the program come true.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was bigger and more vast than I imagined,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI just never thought I would be able to be on a hockey rink in that kind of environment; it exceeded what I had in mind.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the press conference came to an end, singalong the end of Gadowsky\u2019s day at the center of the hockey world and seated in the largest venue the state of Pennsylvania had to offer, the coach was pondered as to if he thinks stadium hockey will return to Penn State. He credited all the university officials under him and offered his support for running it back next year.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s way above my pay grade,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI would love to do it as that was as amazing of a hockey experience as I ever had.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you ever find yourself a member of a Penn State sports team that uses a ball and you\u2019re playing inside Rec Hall in 2026, chances are it's already an uphill battle, and you\u2019re losing.</p>\n                <p>Both basketball squads are winless at the venue in 2026, with some poor results in that stretch. These disappointing results create a reality in which the only sports to win their last home outings at the oldest venue on campus were both gymnastics squads.</p>\n                <p>Yet, the men\u2019s volleyball team, in its final season under Mark Pavlik\u2019s over three decades at the helm, started well on its crusade to change such a narrative, with four straight Rec Hall wins to start the season.</p>\n                <p>After a disastrous Midwest road trip, in which McKendree snapped the Nittany Lions' win streak with a two-match sweep where the blue and white only snagged a single set, the haunting at Rec Hall continued for Penn State athletics.</p>\n                <p>In a particularly chilly and sporting-packed weekend in State College, Pavlik\u2019s squad welcomed a daunting foe in the form of No.3 Hawai\u2019i. In match one, the Rainbow Warriors swept the Nittany Lions decisively.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white kept it close throughout the first two sets, yet a ten-point third set differential sent them packing with a chance for redemption in the second outing \u2013 and just like the first, early starts favored Penn State.</p>\n                <p>That doesn\u2019t mean it went all smoothly for the blue and white. A unit of Jaxon Herr, Ryan Merk, Jaidyn Bethel, Gaige Gabriel, Sean Harvey, Owen Rose and Matthew Luoma started for Penn State, and despite early leads, Hawai\u2019i clawed back and even took the upper hand at times.</p>\n                <p>Back-and-forth action marked the remainder of the frame until a tied 25 score saw action intensify and clean up, with the all-important first set on the line. Pavlik brought Gabriel back onto the floor.</p>\n                <p>However, it wasn\u2019t the 6-foot-8 sophomore deciding the action this time, as he so often has this season; stalwart starter Rose logged two crucial aces to determine the set in the Nittany Lions' favor.</p>\n                <p>With the drama and momentum at a high, the Nittany Lions buckled into the driver\u2019s seat for an opportunity to mount an upset over its island foe, yet instead, Hawai\u2019i immediately drowned out that effort.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not fair to say if the Nittany Lions crashed and burned in that set from behind the wheel, but what is more reasonable is that the Rainbow Warriors may have committed grand theft auto on all momentum behind their four aces en route to a 25-10 smashing.</p>\n                <p>From there, the blue and white were only visible from the rearview, as Hawai\u2019i rainbowed their score with huge scoring runs, which had no pots of gold at the end of it for Penn State. The Rainbow Warriors snatched the first three points of the third set, via a kill and a pair of Nittany Lions\u2019 attack errors.</p>\n                <p>At the midpoint of the set, Hawai\u2019i led 12-6 and continued to easily swerve past anything that Pavlik\u2019s unit threw at them. The Nittany Lions attempted to draw back into it, swapping kills with the Rainbow Warriors. That effort was to no avail, however, as by the time Penn State reached 12, its foe had 20.</p>\n                <p>Bending into the final corner, Hawai\u2019i notched a pair of kills, a point off an error, and an ace to claw closer to victory, and despite a last-minute effort, the blue and white again conceded a set, this time 25-15.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white trudged out for what appeared to be the final set, and the numbers at the time were discouraging. Hawai\u2019i posted a hitting percentage over four times higher, and led in every single statistical category except digs, which entered the fourth set tied at 20.</p>\n                <p>The back-and-forth nature of the play returned, however, with the win on the line for Hawai\u2019i, as both units traded kills. Penn State seized the leveled momentum with savvy setups and thundering kills to claw back into the set, and the two squads knotted at 12 points.</p>\n                <p>Hawai\u2019i showcased its talent on an individual level, getting up to eight aces on the day, and unreal sequences continued to keep this one level. Bethel put it all on the line for Penn State, elevating above the net and even taking a hit off his face, although it didn\u2019t save a point, and the redshirt freshman exited soon after with a tweaked ankle.</p>\n                <p>The fight for points and pandemonium resumed, with the teams extending into extra points, which let the lid off the Rec Hall crowd. The blue and white navigated to set point via an attack error, yet the two teams couldn\u2019t pull away as the score ticked higher and into the 30s.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions had match point and attempted to ice the server with a timeout, but the sequence eventually ended in what would\u2019ve been the set-winning point, as the official initially ruled, an interesting call, as the replay showed the ball well inside the line.</p>\n                <p>Luoma committed an error on the attack, and Hawai\u2019s Adrien Roure smashed the game-winning ace, putting the exclamation point on a 38 to 36 set.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State remains at Rec Hall with an opportunity to get back into the win column with a pair of matches against Saint Francis. The first will be the Nittany Lions\u2019 THON Match at 7 p.m. on Friday, Feb 6.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "No. 5 Penn State men's hockey falls in overtime to No. 2 Michigan State in first game at Beaver Stadium",
    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. \u2013 A top-five conference matchup is exciting as it is, but take it outside in front of a sea of 70,000 fans decked in white in one of the most storied stadiums in the country, and you have a game for the history books.</p>\n                <p>No. 5 Penn State took the ice \u2014 previously the field \u2014 in single-digit, real-feel temperatures for the first-ever outdoor hockey game at Beaver Stadium on Saturday, taking on No. 2 Michigan State in the second meeting of the two-game series.</p>\n                <p>A back-and-forth battle into overtime saw Michigan State secure the sweep with a 5-4 win.</p>\n                <p>The atmosphere at Beaver Stadium was electric from the start, with the Nittany Lions mimicking the classic Penn State football entrance from the tunnel to a chanting and packed student section.</p>\n                <p>The energy from the crowd was quickly stifled, however, when Michigan State struck first less than three minutes into play. A pass from forward Charlie Stramel across the slot found Daniel Russell, who fired a shot past an outstretched Kevin Reidler to give the Spartans an early lead.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State maintained most of the momentum through the next few minutes and was given an early chance to extend its lead when Penn State freshman Lev Katzin was called for the game\u2019s first penalty.</p>\n                <p>Nothing came of the opportunity, however, and the blue and white got its own turn on the man-advantage not long after. Forward Anthony Romani, coming off a hat-trick performance in Friday night's contest, went to the box for hooking with about three minutes to go in the period.</p>\n                <p>Like the Spartans\u2019 earlier opportunity, the Nittany Lions couldn\u2019t get a score. Despite several high-danger chances, star goaltender Trey Augustine showed off his First Team All-American skills and maintained Michigan State's one-goal lead heading into the first intermission.</p>\n                <p>Both Aiden Fink and Penn State found the momentum they had otherwise been lacking just seconds into the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>The former Hobey Baker top-10 finalist had just three goals through 18 games this season, factoring in an injury that sidelined him for over two months back in October.</p>\n                <p>Fink broke his scoring drought just 13 seconds into the second period, after maneuvering around a defender and firing a shot off the top crossbar to even the score.</p>\n                <p>The tie game was short-lived, however, when Stramel collected a rebound out in front of Reidler about three minutes after Fink\u2019s score to retake the lead for the Spartans.</p>\n                <p>Despite Michigan State\u2019s goal, the blue and white continued to hold most of the momentum, and Beaver Stadium could sense it.</p>\n                <p>To the roar of the crowd, star freshman Gavin McKenna found a centering pass from Mac Gadowsky and sent a shot up and over the shoulder of Augustine to tie the game near the halfway mark of the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>It was Penn State dominance for most of the remaining second period, playing with physicality and stifling any offensive momentum the Spartans previously had.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 first lead of the series came late in the middle frame, when Fink found his second of the game with a slapshot off a feed from McKenna that made the overflowing student section erupt.</p>\n                <p>Despite playing its strongest period of the series, the blue and white couldn\u2019t hold on to the lead as the clock ticked down.</p>\n                <p>A trip from Shea Van Olm gave the Spartans a late power-play opportunity, and with just two seconds on the clock, Stramel notched his second score to send the two Big Ten foes into the final 20 minutes tied at three goals apiece.</p>\n                <p>Van Olm made up for his earlier penalty, retaking the lead for the Nittany Lions just four minutes into the final period. The forward stripped the puck from Maxim \u0160trb\u00e1k and used speed to beat a defender, firing a shot to the top corner of the Spartans\u2019 net.</p>\n                <p>Once again, the team in front couldn\u2019t hold on to the lead, and Michigan State answered with a goal of its own just minutes later to even the score.</p>\n                <p>All the back-to-back action came to a halt for the final 12 minutes. Neither side could notch the go-ahead goal as the horn sounded, and Beaver Stadium was sent to overtime.</p>\n                <p>It took three minutes for Michigan State to end it and secure the sweep, after a back-and-forth overtime period.</p>\n                <p>Stramel registered a hat trick when he was left all alone in front of Reidler, and sent a shot to the top crossbar to register the 5-4 win.</p>\n                <p>More Winter Sports Weekend Coverage</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s never too early to think about next year.</p>\n                <p>Ahead of winter workouts, here\u2019s a way-too-early prediction of what Penn State\u2019s offensive depth chart will look like in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Quarterback</p>\n                <p>1. Rocco Becht, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Alex Manske, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>3. Connor Barry, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>4. Peyton Falzone, freshman</p>\n                <p>5. Kase Evans, freshman</p>\n                <p>The starting quarterback is an obvious one, as Rocco Becht transfers to Penn State after three years leading the offense at Iowa State. There\u2019s a natural fit for him in State College, following Matt Campbell, offensive coordinator Taylor Mouser and quarterbacks coach Jake Waters.</p>\n                <p>Behind Becht, there will be a competition for the backup spot between Alex Manske and Connor Barry. Manske also joins the Nittany Lions following a freshman year with the Cyclones while Barry heads to Happy Valley with one year of eligibility left after playing for Division III Christopher Newport in Virginia with a brief stint at Appalachian State beforehand.</p>\n                <p>Despite only playing in three games with limited numbers in 2025, Manske should have the edge in this battle as a former four-star recruit, who Iowa State believed was the quarterback of the future behind Becht. Barry should provide a veteran presence in the No. 3 role, coming off of a career at Christopher Newport where he\u2019s thrown for 5,561 passing yards and 55 touchdowns and most recently winning his conference\u2019s Offensive Player of the Year.</p>\n                <p>Rounding out the room are a pair of freshmen in four-star Peyton Falzone and three-star Kase Evans. Walk-on Jack Lambert is the only quarterback on roster who returns from a season ago.</p>\n                <p>Running back</p>\n                <p>1. Carson Hansen, senior</p>\n                <p>2. James Peoples, junior</p>\n                <p>3. Quinton Martin Jr., redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>4. Cam Wallace, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Iowa State transfer tailback Carson Hansen should be the starter come the season-opener against Marshall. He\u2019s coming off of a 2025 campaign where he was a second-team All-Big 12 selection, rushing for 952 yards and six touchdowns.</p>\n                <p>With that being said, this job won\u2019t be handed to Hansen, as Quinton Martin Jr. and Ohio State transfer James Peoples will more than likely be in the mix.</p>\n                <p>Last year, Peoples totaled 344 rushing yards and three touchdowns as the third Buckeyes\u2019 tailback on the depth chart behind Bo Jackson and CJ Donaldson. Martin didn\u2019t touch the ball during the regular season for Penn State, but exploded in the Pinstripe Bowl, recording 20 carries for 101 yards.</p>\n                <p>There should be a healthy dosage of all three running backs to start the year, but any of them can emerge as the lead back. However, there\u2019s a good chance that this is a running back by committee approach, with the trio all seeing some form of a role.</p>\n                <p>Cam Wallace, who has shown flashes and opted to return for 2026 despite initially entering the transfer portal, will be a key depth piece.</p>\n                <p>Wide receiver</p>\n                <p>X-receiver:</p>\n                <p>1. Chase Sowell, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Peter Gonzalez, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Y-receiver:</p>\n                <p>1. Koby Howard, sophomore</p>\n                <p>2. Keith Jones Jr., redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Z-receiver:</p>\n                <p>1. Brett Eskildsen, junior</p>\n                <p>2. Lyrick Samuel, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>The starting three wideouts on-paper seem to be clear with a pair of Iowa State transfers in Chase Sowell and Brett Eskildsen as well as Koby Howard returning to Penn State for his sophomore year.</p>\n                <p>As far as where they line up on the field, that\u2019ll be up in the air. Sowell will likely be on the outside, while Eskildsen or Howard can either play on the outside or in the slot.</p>\n                <p>A season ago, Sowell totaled 32 receptions for 500 yards and two touchdowns while Eskildsen notched 30 catches for 526 yards and five touchdowns. Howard garnered seven receptions for 133 yards in Year 1 as a Nittany Lion, but received rave reviews throughout the course of the campaign.</p>\n                <p>Peter Gonzalez, Lyrick Samuel and Grambling State transfer Keith Jones Jr. should be the next group up.</p>\n                <p>Tight end</p>\n                <p>1. Andrew Rappleyea, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>2. Benjamin Brahmer, senior</p>\n                <p>3. Gabe Burkle, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>4. Finn Furmanek, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>Andrew Rappleyea and Iowa State transfer Benjamin Brahmer will be the surefire starting tight ends, making them a way-too-early contender for best tandem at the position in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Rappleyea took over as the top Penn State tight end by the end of the 2025, recording 20 catches for 180 yards and three touchdowns in the final three games of the year. Brahmer, a 2025 second-team All-Big 12 selection, has 977 receiving yards and nine touchdowns through three seasons with the Cyclones.</p>\n                <p>Gabe Burkle, another ex-Iowa State tight end, should round out the crew of top players at the position. He accumulated 54 receptions for 607 yards and two scores in four years with the Cyclones.</p>\n                <p>Finn Furmanek will be a key depth piece, as the State College native saw a key role on special teams as well a year ago. Per Sean Fitz of On3, he was put on scholarship.</p>\n                <p>Offensive line</p>\n                <p>Left tackle:</p>\n                <p>Anthony Donkoh, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>Owen Aliciene, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>Left guard:</p>\n                <p>Trevor Buhr, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>Malachi Goodman, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>Center:</p>\n                <p>Brock Riker, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Dom Rulli, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>Right guard:</p>\n                <p>Cooper Cousins, junior</p>\n                <p>Goodman</p>\n                <p>Right tackle:</p>\n                <p>Garrett Sexton, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Aliciene</p>\n                <p>Anthony Donkoh is the lone starter to return from 2025, as the rest of the crew is off to the NFL draft. He started at right guard, but with him being the best player, and experience as the starter at right tackle, he could shift over to left tackle to protect Becht\u2019s blindside.</p>\n                <p>At the other tackle spot, it\u2019ll be a battle between Garrett Sexton and Owen Aliciene. Sexton was the backup right tackle to Nolan Rucci last year, while Aliciene was the third-string left tackle behind Drew Shelton and now-Florida transfer Eagan Boyer. With Sexton having one more year under his belt, he should have the upper hand in this position battle.</p>\n                <p>For guards, Cooper Cousins and Trevor Buhr should lock down the starting spots. Cousins has been a rotational piece the past two seasons, burning his redshirt in 2024 as a freshman, and starting in the Pinstripe Bowl. Buhr appeared in eight games for Iowa State last year, starting in six of them.</p>\n                <p>At center, it\u2019ll be a battle between Texas State transfer Brock Riker and walk-on-turned scholarship player Dom Rulli, who started in the Pinstripe Bowl.</p>\n                <p>Rulli has done some good things for Penn State, notably on special teams as the punt protector, but Riker started in all 12 games in 2025 and was a highly sought after player in the portal by Power Four programs. He also was also a second-team freshman All-American via The Athletic.</p>\n                <p>Malachi Goodman is a versatile piece off of the bench, who can play either guard or tackle. He came to Penn State as a tackle but practiced at guard under former position coach Phil Trautwein.</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-6, 315-pound redshirt freshman was a highly touted recruit, ranking as a high four-star, but didn\u2019t see the field his freshman year.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State is just over a week from one of its most anticipated seasons in several years under coach Kayla Treanor\u2019s first year.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions held an open viewing session for media and fans, featuring two quarters of scrimmage and one quarter of situational work.</p>\n                <p>After 45 minutes of action, here\u2019s what to expect from this year\u2019s Penn State team.</p>\n                <p>Strong attack</p>\n                <p>The White team wasted no time getting down the field after winning the opening faceoff, led by sophomore Allie Meyer. A little over one minute into the game, Meyer scored the scrimmage\u2019s first goal against starting goalie Sydney Manning.</p>\n                <p>The White team\u2019s success continued midway through the first period as fellow sophomore Ellie Wisch put her team up 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s scrimmage was a high-scoring affair through 15 minutes, with goals by Emma Kelly, Delaney Radin and Rocquette Allen.</p>\n                <p>The second period was slightly slower after four minutes, with neither side able to score. However, things got going after Allen secured her second goal of the day.</p>\n                <p>The Blue team ultimately took a commanding lead to win the scrimmage with another goal from Wisch and the first goals of the game by Maddie Greco, Erika Ho and Payton Wainman.</p>\n                <p>Clean play</p>\n                <p>It was nearly five minutes of play without any turnovers for either team. Treanor\u2019s offense was playing crisp, clean lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>While multiple passes went astray by the end of the game, the two sides combined for only a few turnovers from pressure and carelessness.</p>\n                <p>The scrimmage featured several fouls from both teams, with many players being shown the green card and taken off the field for the minute-long violation.</p>\n                <p>Team depth</p>\n                <p>Nearly every player saw the field in Friday\u2019s scrimmage, showcasing the depth of Treanor\u2019s squad this year.</p>\n                <p>That strength was on display through the opening period with the White team \u2014 played by a majority of underclassmen \u2014 leading the charge.</p>\n                <p>Two sophomores scored the opening two goals, and freshman Allen scored two of her own.</p>\n                <p>Goalkeeper questions</p>\n                <p>While Sydney Manning has been Penn State\u2019s premier goalkeeper throughout her first two seasons, starting in 26 out of 32 games, she wasn\u2019t the star on Friday.</p>\n                <p>Senior Emily Bette was the goalkeeper to watch in the team\u2019s scrimmage, recording two saves against two goals in the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>The Albany, New York, native had a hard task while defending the net against Penn State\u2019s starters.

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Nebraska wrestled a visually frustrating style against the Nittany Lions. A majority of matches saw the Cornhuskers keeping their knees to the ground and backing off engagement, looking to pick a spot to potentially take down the high-powered Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The reaction from the Nittany Lions was a show of apparent frustration across multiple matches, including Mitchell Mesenbrink urging LJ Araujo to take action in his match and Levi Haines nearly shoving Christopher Minto off of the stage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not always going to have your best night, and as a team, maybe we were a little flat,\u201d Cael Sanderson said. \u201cI think the guys had to get tough to battle some really good wrestlers.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While the upper classmen let their emotions fly, one freshman kept his composure in a low-scoring match, despite suffering the first loss of his collegiate career in controversial fashion.</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke surged up to the top three of the 157 pound weight class throughout the first part of his first season, entering his match at the Bryce Jordan Center undefeated. In his way was the defending national champion at his weight, No. 5 Antrell Taylor.</p>\n                <p>From the outset of the match, Taylor stayed low, not allowing Duke any leverage to get to his legs. Despite multiple attempts from the former U20 World Champion, Taylor was rarely in real danger due to his ability to back away from his opponent.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe see it every week, it\u2019s nothing new, but it\u2019s hard to wrestle,\u201dSanderson said. \u201cRefs don\u2019t really call stalling traditionally anymore.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The only form of engagement offered by Taylor to avoid the stall calls was rough hand fighting that was the signature of Nebraska\u2019s dual strategy. Taylor kept his hands in the face of Duke when they weren\u2019t being used to push him backwards or maintaining distance wrist control.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just jabbing us in the face and backing up, right?\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe have to be able to close the gap and do our thing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Duke did have a takedown opportunity in the first period, getting his arms around Taylor on the edge of the mat and getting off his feet momentarily, but the ruling by the referees was to not award a takedown in the moment.</p>\n                <p>Assistant coach Nick Lee threw the challenge brick on the mat, leading to a moment of confusion as the refs didn\u2019t begin the challenge until after lengthy conversations with both coaching staffs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was my call to throw the brick and we probably shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cIt was close enough that we threw, and we obviously wish we had it later on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After multiple minutes looking at the tape, the call of no takedown stood, citing reaction time.</p>\n                <p>The NCAA rulebook in 2025-26 allows for wrestlers to have their hands or knees on the mat for a \u201csplit-second\u201d without being ruled a takedown as reaction time. However, the explicit time isn\u2019t known and has been viewed as a judgement call to the referees. Sanderson didn\u2019t take the judgement into effect before he threw the brick.</p>\n                <p>As the bout continued, Taylor stalled the rest of the way through the bout, including sudden victory. The pair went to a tiebreaker in which Taylor successfully rode Duke out for 30 seconds, awarding him the deciding second point.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Nittany Lions 26-12 victory, Nebraska\u2019s strategy in this Bryce Jordan Center dual was to slow Penn State\u2019s rampant offensive pace using stall techniques and hand fighting. Duke fell victim to the trap, taking his first collegiate loss to Taylor.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Duke) will be fine,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe\u2019ll learn from it, keep getting better and that\u2019s the name of the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>Despite all the success Cael Sanderson has had at Penn State, one thing that recently has been a struggle to find is a consistent 125-pound wrestler.</p>\n                <p>That all changed when Sanderson secured Wyoming Seminary product, Luke Lilledahl, to provide comfortability in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust starting off a dual with some high-scoring matches, and scoring (as) many team points as I can is really fun,\u201d Lilledahl said.</p>\n                <p>In the 2020-21 season, Penn State had Robert Howard wrestle, but he lost early in the NCAA Tournament. The following year Drew Hildebrandt seemed to be the guy to break the trend, but after earning the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten Tournament, he fell early in the NCAA\u2019s, as well. Gary Steen missed the NCAA Tournament in 2023, before Braeden Davis took the spot in his true freshman season.</p>\n                <p>Davis won the Big Ten title his freshman year, but was quickly ousted at the NCAA Tournament, going 2-2 and falling out of an All-American spot.</p>\n                <p>Insert Lilledahl, who\u2019s taken the 125-pound weight class by storm. He was the top-ranked wrestler in the 2024 recruiting class, and has lived up to those expectations. In his true freshman season, he garnered a 25-3 overall record and held the No. 1 ranking at one point in the season.</p>\n                <p>He went 4-0 in Evanston, Illinois, en route to a Big Ten title, before going 6-1, ending with a pinfall victory over the previously top seed, Matt Ramos of Purdue, to earn third place in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl is now the No. 1 wrestler at the weight class in his second year, and has provided that consistency at the lightest weight, and the typical leadoff wrestler for the lineup.</p>\n                <p>He faced the easiest competitor of the entire dual on paper, taking on unranked Alan Koehler to open the Bryce Jordan Center on Friday against Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl lived up to his \u201clightning Luke\u201d nickname, defeating Koehler by tech fall after a quick takedown to start the dual off.</p>\n                <p>He was the catalyst to a quick, and hot start for the Nittany Lions. His follow up, Marcus Blaze, came out on top in a top-10 matchup and Braeden Davis came out the gates flying to begin his match.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-two punch, it\u2019s pretty much like a 10-punch knockout,\u201d Lilledhal said.</p>\n                <p>He lets his fellow No. 1-ranked wrestlers finish the job, with top-ranked Rocco Welsh sealing the deal against Nebraska. Welsh is joined by Shayne Van Ness, Mitchell Mesenbrink, Levi Haines and Josh Barr as No. 1 wrestlers in addition to Lilledahl.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat sounds pretty good,\u201d Sanderson said of his six No. 1 wrestlers. \u201cI never really thought about that. We love our lineup, we love our guys, we\u2019re just gonna keep getting better every match and be at our best.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite the four straight top-ranked wrestlers from 165 pounds to 197 pounds, it\u2019s the \u201clightning\u201d wrestler that kicks things off to really get things going.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl has started off every dual with a victory, advancing to 14-0 on the season after his victory, and holds a 67% bonus rate, often getting Penn State started with a four or more point lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like a lot of times, duals may start off slow, and then they can pick up the pace, but I feel like a lot of our duals, if you\u2019re not here early, then you\u2019re gonna miss something, and I think that\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Lilledahl said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Two months ago, Penn State walked out of East Lansing, Michigan, with a 5-0 loss and almost half a game in penalty minutes. The Nittany Lions were swept by Michigan State in a series that saw over 25 total penalties and four misconducts.</p>\n                <p>The dislike between the two Big Ten foes is unmistakable, and that was no different when the No. 5 blue and white welcomed the No. 2 Spartans to Pegula Ice Arena for a rematch Friday night.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo matter how you put it, it\u2019s two top-five teams playing each other, so it\u2019s going to be physical,\u201d forward Reese Laubach said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be two teams that want to kill the other one.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A night filled with physicality ended in Michigan State\u2019s favor, besting the Nittany Lions 6-3.</p>\n                <p>The animosity picked up right where it left off, as the Spartans laid some heavy hits from the first whistle.</p>\n                <p>The first penalty happened shortly after Michigan State\u2019s first goal, when star defenseman Jackson Smith was called for interference.</p>\n                <p>The blue and whites\u2019 4th-ranked penalty kill held on, however, highlighted by Fleming\u2019s solid performance in net.</p>\n                <p>The first time tensions boiled over came with about six minutes left in the first period, after Penn State\u2019s Nic Chin-DeGraves and Michigan State\u2019s Shane Vansaghi got into it in front of Fleming\u2019s net.</p>\n                <p>A line brawl followed, and it took the refs several minutes to drag Chin-DeGraves away from the action and into the penalty box.</p>\n                <p>Chin-DeGraves was awarded two minor penalties for cross checking and unsportsmanlike conduct on top of a 10 minute misconduct, while Vansaghi was awarded a minor penalty for roughing.</p>\n                <p>The Spartans got another shot at the powerplay, with Chin-DeGraves animatedly yelling at Vansaghi across the box for the next several minutes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEmotions get high and emotions get low, and you got to find that even keel,\u201d defenseman Jarod Crespo said. \u201cBut that kid really wanted to win, and he came back and played a great game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>This time, Michigan State got one on the man-advantage after sophomore Owen West\u2019s shot from the point made it through traffic.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white got its first chance on the power play thanks to senior Daniel Russel, but the penalty was negated less than 30 seconds later, when Smith was called for his second interference of the night.</p>\n                <p>4-on-4 hockey provided no goals, but Michigan State capitalized on its short man-advantage when Cayden Lindstrom found Romani in the slot for his second score of the night.</p>\n                <p>To a resounding chorus of boo\u2019s for the officials, Penn State headed into the locker room chasing three goals after the first 20 minutes.</p>\n                <p>After Aiden Fink was caught up high and laid out at center ice by Lindstrom, freshman phenom Gavin McKenna came to the forward\u2019s defense, and both sides started trading punches.</p>\n                <p>Both McKenna and Lindstrom were given 5-minute majors and game misconducts, ending their nights, while the Spartans\u2019 Colin Ralph was given an additional 5-minute major for face masking.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou\u2019re returning two-time MVP gets popped right in the head, no, I don\u2019t mind the response at all,\u201d Coach Gadowsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see that happen to your teammate, and you just respond, and (McKenna) just responded.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite several high danger chances, the blue and white couldn\u2019t figure out how to get past first-team All-American netminder Trey Augustine on the extended power play.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white had a new life after Laubach\u2019s goal, and after successfully killing off a 5-on-3 opportunity from the Spartans, Hockey Valley could feel the energy shift.</p>\n                <p>Another Michigan State penalty gave the Nittany Lions a golden opportunity with the momentum on their side, and as time expired on the power play, Matt DiMarsico tipped in a shot from JJ Wiebusch, bringing it within one goal of a comeback.</p>\n                <p>That goal never came, however, and despite a strong final frame, two empty net goals for the Spartans sealed the Nittany Lions\u2019 6-3 loss.</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Guy Gadowsky praises Gavin McKenna\u2019s response to Aiden Fink taking big hit",
    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Big Ten hockey thrives on physicality. It\u2019s why Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky preaches a grit-and-grind mentality \u2014 one that ranks giving maximum effort above anything else.</p>\n                <p>Another pillar of Gadowsky\u2019s culture: Stand up for your teammates when you think it\u2019s necessary, no matter the ensuing costs.</p>\n                <p>That philosophy was tested early in the second period when Aiden Fink took a bruising hit as he exited Penn State\u2019s defensive zone. Fink skated with his head down as he eyed a loose puck before Michigan State\u2019s Cayden Lindstrom dug his shoulder into Fink\u2019s head, causing the junior forward to torpedo into the ice, where he\u2019d lie for an additional minute.</p>\n                <p>As the Pegula Ice Arena crowd roared in disgust, Fink\u2019s teammates \u2014 Gavin McKenna, Dane Dowiak and Nolan Collins \u2014 beelined toward Lindstrom. There was zero hesitation in their decision, one fully backed by their head coach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen your returning MVP (Fink) is popped right in the head, I don't mind the response at all,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cYou see that happen to your teammate, you just respond. Gavin just responded.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Collins knocked Lindstrom to the ground. Colin Ralph and Dowiak exchanged blows along the boards. McKenna threw several jabs at a Spartan skater as a mob formed alongside Penn State\u2019s bench.</p>\n                <p>After a lengthy review, Lindstrom and Ralph received five-minute major penalties and game misconducts for their involvement. Trailing 3-0, Penn State had earned a much-needed five-minute power play.</p>\n                <p>The downside: McKenna was booked for facemasking, which resulted in a five-minute major and a game misconduct. The Nittany Lions, who already faced a three-goal deficit, were now without one of their top offensive creators.</p>\n                <p>But the team didn\u2019t care. Their star player didn\u2019t hesitate to defend his teammate after a blindside hit. And for that, McKenna\u2019s teammates expressed great respect.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhoever gets hit, we're gonna stand up for him,\u201d Reese Laubach said. \u201cDoesn't matter if it\u2019s (Fink) \u2014 it could be anyone. Obviously, taking a penalty and losing Gavin sucks, but he was standing up for (his) teammate.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions went scoreless on their five-minute power play. But it awoke something in them \u2014 a renewed energy following Lindstrom\u2019s hit that sparked a spirited comeback.</p>\n                <p>First, Jackson Smith wristed one off the far post and in to make it a 3-1 game. And despite Porter Martone\u2019s tally near the end of the second period, Penn State felt it was right there.</p>\n                <p>Laubach answered Mortone\u2019s tally with a tap-in goal off a cross-ice feed from Carter Schade to make it 4-2. Minutes later, JJ Wiebusch backhanded a pass to Matt DiMarsico, who tapped in his 15th goal of the season to make it a one-score game.</p>\n                <p>The Spartans later added two empty-net goals to halt Penn State\u2019s comeback. But the Nittany Lions never quit \u2014 a perseverance that drew Gadowsky\u2019s praise.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe had a lot of chances, we didn't solve them until late, (we) hit a few posts, but I love how we came back,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI think we played a more consistent game, territorially, than the scoring would indicate \u2026 I don't think we played much differently, except the punks went in.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 1 Penn State entered the Bryce Jordan Center for its second time this season, but for its first official BJC dual of the calendar year.</p>\n                <p>The match contained a lot of confusion, but the result was in Penn State\u2019s favor, as the Nittany Lions got the 26-12 victory over No. 6 Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>125 Pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs Alan Koehler (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl was aggressive off the jump, getting the early takedown in the opening 30 seconds. After an early escape and an attempt to gain higher position, Alan Koehler couldn\u2019t stay off the ground as Lilledahl got another takedown. Lilledahl led 9-2 going into the second period.</p>\n                <p>Koehler with the early escape, Lilledahl with another slam to the mat. Lilledahl continued to go at Koehler\u2019s leg and tallied four-near fall points. The sophomore held a 14-3 lead going into the third period. Lilledahl got the tech fall 20-4.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 5-0.</p>\n                <p>133 Pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs No. 10 Jacob Van Dee (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze and Jacob Van Dee were even early in the match. Van Dee didn\u2019t give Blaze any space, but didn\u2019t do any attacking. Blaze got a hold of Van Dee and got the only takedown of the period.</p>\n                <p>There wasn\u2019t much action in the middle period, which continued into the final frame. Blaze got the victory, 5-1.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 8-0.</p>\n                <p>141 Pounds: No. 12 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs No. 4 Brock Hardy (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis didn\u2019t waste any time, as he took Brock Hardy down immediately. Davis got another takedown right after Hardy got up, controlling the first period with a 6-2 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Davis got the escape, not allowing Hardy to attack, allowing his defense to protect himself. Hardy then got his first takedown of the match, leading Davis 7-5.</p>\n                <p>Hardy escaped early in the third, cutting the deficit to one. At the end of the match, Hardy tapped Davis\u2019s chest, where Davis then tried to trip him.</p>\n                <p>The two had some words after the match, resulting in a penalty point deducted from Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 7-6.</p>\n                <p>149 Pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs No. 18 Chance Lamer (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Chance Lamer got the first takedown of the match. Van Ness did escape, but Lamer seemed to be the quicker wrestler. Lamer led 3-1.</p>\n                <p>After a quick escape in the second period by Lamer, Van Ness tied the match with a takedown.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness escaped and got another takedown to take the 8-4 lead. Once Lamer was down, it took him a while to get back up. Van Ness recorded another takedown and then a 12-5 victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 10-6.</p>\n                <p>157 Pounds: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs No. 5 Antrell Taylor (NEB)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke and Antrell Taylor was a stalemate to start. Taylor continued to drop to a knee, which prevented Duke from doing anything. Duke tried to attack, but couldn\u2019t get anything going.</p>\n                <p>Duke got what looked to be a takedown that wasn\u2019t awarded a takedown. Penn State challenged and it was confirmed to be no takedown, resulting in no score after the first.</p>\n                <p>Taylor escaped quickly taking an early lead. Taylor continued to be on both knees for most of the period. Duke escaped in the third to tie the match, as Taylor continued to avoid Duke and not engage in any offense.</p>\n                <p>Sudden victory was the same as the first three periods. Time was ticking and Duke was getting frustrated. Taylor escaped by what the Penn State fans thought was a controversial call by the refs. Duke couldn\u2019t escape and Taylor got the victory despite appearing to be stalling throughout the match.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 10-9.</p>\n                <p>165 Pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs No. 7 LJ Araujo (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink opened the match with a takedown. That trend continued two more times as Mesenbrink got a pair of takedowns and took a 9-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink delivered another takedown and controlled LJ Araujo the entire match, and was awarded two-stalling points, extending his lead to 14-4. Mesenbrink flattened Araujo, got the reversal and another takedown to get a 19-5 lead.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink got the tech fall with the riding time.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 15-9.</p>\n                <p>174 Pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs No. 4 Christopher Minto (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines shoved Christopher Minto off the mat and over the barricade, awarding a point to Minto. Haines escaped at the beginning of the second period, which was followed by a Minto takedown. Haines trailed 4-2.</p>\n                <p>Haines got a takedown to gain a 5-4 lead. Haines got another takedown and garnered the victory 8-6.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 18-9</p>\n                <p>184 Pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs No. 7 Silas Allred (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh got the early takedown and controlled the early part of the match. Welsh garnered another takedown to lead, 6-2, going into the second period.</p>\n                <p>Welsh kicked Silas Allred\u2019s left leg to get his third takedown of the match, taking a 9-4 lead going into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Welsh continued his dominance and got the 15-5, major-decision victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 21-9.</p>\n                <p>197 Pounds: No. Josh Barr (PSU) vs No 9 Camden McDaniel (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr got the takedown early as he continued the trend of most of the Penn State matches. Barr made it difficult for Camden McDaniel to get up, and when he did, Barr would slam him back down onto the mat. Barr led 12-3 after the first period featuring four takedowns.</p>\n                <p>Barr added multiple takedowns including yanking McDaniel back into the center of the mat to get a 19-6 lead. McDaniel got his first takedown of the match to make it 19-9.</p>\n                <p>Bar got the victory by major decision 21-9.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 26-9.</p>\n                <p>Heavyweight: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs No. 4 AJ Ferrari (NEB)</p>\n                <p>AJ Ferrari tried to get a takedown to start, but couldn\u2019t get complete control of Cole Mirasola. Mirasola avoided a few takedowns by spinning out of them. Ferrari escaped early to gain a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola almost got the first takedown of the match, but Ferrari never allowed him to get full control.</p>\n                <p>Ferrari rode Mirasola for most of the third period. Ferrari kept looking for blood, but the ref didn\u2019t oblige. Ferrari got the riding-time point and got the victory 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got the victory 26-12.</p>",

    "title": "No. 5 Penn State comes out flat on Friday, loses to No. 2 Michigan State despite comeback bid",
    "author": "Chase Fisher | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A filled-in crowd at Pegula Ice Arena unleashed two of its loudest reactions of the night during pregame introductions. One was for the booing of Michigan State goaltender Trey Augustine. The other was the deafening cheers for Penn State netminder Josh Fleming.</p>\n                <p>While the introductions for both goaltenders were vastly different, the reactions were as loud as they were for the same reason: both Augustine and Fleming are key to each program\u2019s top-five ranking in the country.</p>\n                <p>However, neither one got its footing on Friday in a relatively high-scoring affair. In the end, it was No. 5 Penn State on the losing end, dropping Game 1 to No. 2 Michigan State, 6-3, and ending its seven-game winning streak.</p>\n                <p>First period</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s first period started as advertised, as both teams played physically behind a raucous Pegula Ice Arena crowd. While vicious hits were exchanged on both sides, Michigan State was the one to take advantage of them early.</p>\n                <p>Just four minutes into the contest, defenseman Maxim Strbak retrieved a puck and fed an outlet pass to right wing Anthony Romani shortly after right wing Aiden Fink was knocked down onto the ice.</p>\n                <p>That feed led Romani into a breakaway with defenseman Jarod Crespo on the backcheck, but the Spartans\u2019 third liner was able to beat Fleming on his forehand, giving Michigan State a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Spartans piled on in a chaotic final five minutes of the first frame, beginning with defenseman Owen West flicking a wrist shot from the point on the power play past Fleming\u2019s left blocker to extend Michigan State\u2019s lead to 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Then, Romani tallied his second score of the night on the man-advantage, one-timing a shot off a backhand feed from center Cayden Lindstrom to make it 3-0 Spartans.</p>\n                <p>Second period</p>\n                <p>Similarly to the first period, the action began four minutes into the second frame. However, it wasn\u2019t scoring that sparked the deafening crowd pops \u2014 it was several massive hits and scrums.</p>\n                <p>Lindstrom started the party, delivering a crushing hit on Fink near the blue line. Left wing Gavin McKenna retaliated, leveling his former teammate on the Medicine Hat Tigers seconds later.</p>\n                <p>Both Lindstrom and McKenna, as well as defenseman Colin Ralph, were sentenced to five-minute majors. However, despite earning a five-minute man-advantage, Penn State couldn\u2019t score or generate dangerous chances.</p>\n                <p>Those values held true on the Nittany Lions\u2019 second power play of the period, until defenseman Jackson Smith gloved down a wobbling puck and fired a wrist shot past Augustine and into the back of the net, cutting Penn State\u2019s deficit to 3-1 with a hair under nine minutes remaining in the period.</p>\n                <p>But that momentum didn\u2019t last long, as left wing Lev Katzin conceded a costly turnover behind the goal, which led to right wing Porter Martone jamming home a goal through Fleming\u2019s five hole and extending Michigan State\u2019s lead to 4-1.</p>\n                <p>Third period</p>\n                <p>For the third consecutive period, the action started four minutes into the frame. But for the first time, it was via a Penn State goal, cutting its deficit to 4-2.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 tally came from center Reese Laubach, who tapped in a shot on the backdoor of Augustine, which came from a pass from the point by defenseman Carter Schade.</p>\n                <p>Penn State continued its comeback on the power play in the midst of an exchange of penalties. Near the midway point of the period, right wing JJ Wiebusch took a rebound off the boards and fed left wing Matt DiMarsico at the goalmouth, where the junior hammered the puck past Augustine on one knee, cutting the Nittany Lions\u2019 deficit to 4-3.</p>\n                <p>However, that\u2019s all Penn State could muster up in its comeback bid, as Romani iced the game to finish off his hat trick and left wing Daniel Russell hit an empty-net goal with 22 seconds remaining to lead Michigan State to a 6-3 win.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Defenseman Casey Aman, who was listed as day-to-day according to coach Guy Gadowsky on Tuesday, was inactive on Friday.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State and Michigan State will duel in the first-ever outdoor game at Beaver Stadium at 1 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>To kick off another weekend series, Penn State returned to Rec Hall after getting swept by McKendree to host No. 3 Hawai'i in its White Out game.</p>\n                <p>The Rainbow Warriors weren\u2019t affected by the snowstorm in State College, though, traveling just under 5000 miles to take down the Nittany Lions and pick up a 3-0 sweep in the first game of the series.</p>\n                <p>No. 3 Hawai'i got on the board first and got hot off the rip, quickly jumping up to a 4-1 lead in the early running.</p>\n                <p>A lot of points in the early stages usually come from service errors, but it was just kill after kill for both sides, with Kainoa Wade kicking it off.</p>\n                <p>Penn State found itself down 7-3 after a Sean Harvey service error, and things were looking bleak, but the Nittany Lions were stepping on the heels of the Rainbow Warriors despite falling in a hole early on.</p>\n                <p>Harvey, far and away leading the blue and white in kills, currently with 71, notched another in an effort to cut his squad\u2019s deficit to just one point.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions took their first lead thanks to a Matthew Luoma ace put them up 15-14 in a tightly contested first frame.</p>\n                <p>Just when it looked like Penn State was going to pull ahead, Hawai'i went on a 4-0 scoring run on its way to capturing the first set 25-22.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back Adrien Roure kills kicked off another Rainbow Warrior scoring run as they quickly got out to a 7-3 lead in the second set with Luomo giving Penn State its only point not from errors.</p>\n                <p>Really turning it up, Hawaii went on a suffocating 5-0 scoring run, backed by kills from Roure and Wade, which were followed by back-to-back service aces out of Tread Rosenthal.</p>\n                <p>The Rainbow Warriors were laying the hurt on the blue and white as they sailed to an 18-9 lead thanks to that scoring run.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was failing to chip away at the lead and was stuck watching the second set slip away.</p>\n                <p>Yet another Harvey kill kept the Nittany Lions alive, though many of their points were coming off Hawai'i errors.</p>\n                <p>Just as it looked like the Rainbow Warriors were going to pull away, Penn State went on a 6-0 scoring run backed with a service ace from Owen Rose to tie it at 22-22. Rattled, Charlie Wade and Hawai'i used a timeout.</p>\n                <p>Though the Nittany Lions kept it interesting down the stretch, it wasn\u2019t enough to shake the Rainbow Warriors, who won the second set 25-23.</p>\n                <p>Another Harvey kill just couldn\u2019t match back-to-back scores from Justin Todd, which gave him five kills on the night and moved Hawai'i just one set away from a first-game sweep.</p>\n                <p>With 10 kills on the night, it felt like Harvey was doing everything by himself on the floor. Ryan Merk, who just earned EIVA defensive player of the week honors, was quiet all night, not able to lend much help.</p>\n                <p>Just like it had the rest of the night, Hawai'i immediately went on a 4-0 scoring run in the third set, with Rosenthal picking up an ace along the way.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions closed the gap, though, with Gabriel Gaige garnering an ace of his own to cut the Rainbow Warriors\u2019 lead to 6-4.</p>\n                <p>Hawai'i extended its lead to four points after a Harvey attack error, but Penn State was closing in prior to that misstep, picking up back-to-back kills.</p>\n                <p>Mark Pavlik was forced into a timeout after Hawai'i moved just nine points away from the sweep after a Finn Kearney service ace pushed his squad out to a 16-10 lead.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was dead in the water after falling behind 20-13, unable to stop Hawaii from piecing together consistent scoring drives.</p>\n                <p>In full control in the third frame, the Rainbow Warriors moved even closer with a Louis Sakanoko kill, but yet another Harvey kill kept Penn State in it for now.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, though, the Nittany Lions just couldn\u2019t climb out of the hole as Hawai'i won the third set 25-15 to pick up the sweep.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State is back in action tomorrow for game two of its early-season series against Hawai'i.</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s match is set for 5 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Snow-filled bleachers, paired with freezing weather, did not deter rowdy Penn State fans from supporting No. 4 Penn State at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>A record-setting 1,838 fans, dressed head to toe in winter gear, witnessed not only the first-ever Penn State hockey game outdoors, but a 3-0 Nittany Lions win over Robert Morris.</p>\n                <p>It wasn\u2019t until the clock struck 15 minutes left in the game that the public address announcer informed the stadium about the historic milestone. The immediate roar from the crowd lifted the Nittany Lions throughout the final minutes of the game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was excited to hear the attendance record, the bench was fired up,\u201d McKenna Walsh said. \u201cIt was cold and it\u2019s a 1 p.m. game, so it\u2019s tough to get people to come out. The fact that we set the (attendance) record at this game is pretty special.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Walsh had the honor of scoring the first-ever goal in Beaver Stadium after the puck bounced off her skate and into the net. This was only the second goal of the season for the Oswego, Illinois, native.</p>\n                <p>The historic attendance played a major role in the atmosphere throughout the game. From the opening faceoff to the final buzzer, the air was filled with chants and constant support for the players on the ice.</p>\n                <p>Katie DeSa recorded her ninth shutout of the season and was met with cheers from the fans as she headed down the tunnel. However, for the Pawcatuck, Connecticut, native, she saw this moment as a full circle, closing out her senior season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEspecially being a senior, it's great to have it in my final year,\u201d DeSa said. \u201c(I) definitely appreciate it a little more having come to Beaver (Stadium) for football games the last four years and then finally being able to play there. It\u2019s really awesome.\u201d</p>\n                <p>An energetic atmosphere was ultimately topped off with the Nittany Lions heading through the gates and down the tunnel, surrounded by handmade banners made by the \u201cRoarZone.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For coach Jeff Kampersal, the Nittany Lions\u2019 continued work together further exemplified the \u201cstandards\u201d they\u2019ve set for themselves. Penn State adapted to the unusual environment and never gave up on its goals, which only added to the trust Kampersal instills in his team.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey have higher goals than what they\u2019ve accomplished so far, but trust is our biggest core value,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cI trust them all with my life, I think they have that sort of relationship with everyone else. That\u2019s what makes us so connected on the ice.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The connection between player and coach could be seen since the start of the season, as Penn State had its best start in program history, winning 16-straight games.</p>\n                <p>From being a part of the first hockey game inside Beaver Stadium to setting records throughout the season, there is a belief in the locker room that this historic game set the program on track to reach new heights.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHere at Penn State, we get so much support it\u2019s insane,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI think that people are starting to realize women\u2019s sports really matter. So, I think that was a big step for us, and then (fans) coming here supporting us, it\u2019s super special.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>There was a lot of unfamiliar territory explored when No. 4 Penn State took the ice to face conference opponent Robert Morris University.</p>\n                <p>A roughly 40-yard walk to the bench from the tunnel, Beaver Stadium public address announcer Joe Putnam announced the starters, opposed to Pegula Ice Arena\u2019s Rodney Martin, and the students of the Roar Zone were not breathing down the neck of the opposing goaltender.</p>\n                <p>However, all that went away when the familiar sound of the goal horn echoed through Beaver Stadium, signaling a goal from McKenna Walsh, the first outdoor goal in Penn State hockey history, en route to a 3-0 win over the Colonials.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a legend now,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said, and referred to her as a \u201clunch-pailer,\u201d focusing on her work ethic. \u201cEvery day she goes to work with a lunch pail and grinds. She\u2019s not gonna get a ton of points, but she\u2019ll defend the other team\u2019s better players. She\u2019ll win faceoffs, she\u2019ll grind, get in the goalie\u2019s mix and stir things up a bit.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After a scoreless first period, the Nittany Lions finally struck 12 minutes into the middle frame of action.</p>\n                <p>After Walsh stick-lifted and knocked Robert Morris winger Rowyn Ringor off the puck, Katelyn Roberts deflected Catriona Crarer\u2019s attempt to dump the puck into the Colonials\u2019 offensive zone and knocked the puck into the neutral zone.</p>\n                <p>Walsh picked up the puck at the red line and skated up the near-side boards in a 2-on-1 with Shelby Shane, who was promoted from the extra skater position to the third-line left wing position in coach Kampersal\u2019s adjusted lineup in the absence of Tessa Janecke, Matilde Fantin and Nicole Hall for Olympic purposes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShelby\u2019s a really smart player,\u201d Kampersal said. He also mentioned that despite the freshman\u2019s low minutes this season, she\u2019s a happy kid. \u201cShe thrived when her number was called and we would expect nothing less from her. I thought she was dynamite as well, made the plays that she needed to make.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After she crossed the blue line and entered the Penn State offensive zone, the Oswego, Illinois, native skated to the near-side faceoff circle and delivered a centering pass to Shane. While Walsh cut toward the net, Shane sent a backhand pass that kissed Walsh\u2019s skate and effortlessly slid through the five-hole of Robert Morris goaltender Maggie Hatch.</p>\n                <p>Despite it being a historic goal, that wasn\u2019t even a thought in Walsh\u2019s mind. She said she didn't, at the moment, realize the significance of her goal. Instead, it was more important for a different reason.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was more excited to get us on the board because I knew once we got one, we were gonna get another,\u201d Walsh said.</p>\n                <p>The goal served as the first of the game and the second of the year for the sophomore center, the sixth of her career. Shane now has three points in her collegiate career, all on assists.</p>\n                <p>Walsh also praised the Kutztown, Pennsylvania, native Shane.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought she did awesome today and obviously [I] wouldn\u2019t have scored without her, but she did really good, and I can\u2019t wait to see how she\u2019s gonna excel from here,\u201d Walsh said.</p>\n                <p>Walsh and the Nittany Lions will conclude their series against Robert Morris on Saturday at 6 p.m. at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Goaltender Katie DeSa closed out the game with 13 saves on 13 shots and recorded her 22nd career shutout, building on her program record as she now leads the nation with nine on the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey set their own standards, as coaches, we can guide, we can work on them with habits and things like that,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said. \u201cBut they're doing their own thing on a day like today.\u201d</p>\n                <p><a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/women_hockey/penn-state-womens-hockeys-beaver-stadium-game-breaks-single-game-attendance-record/article_da895c98-bde6-4e76-af43-60d6c1767c6e.html\" target=\"_blank\">The contest set the record for the highest single-game attendance in program history, with 1,838 spectators watching in person.</a></p>\n                <p>Less than a minute and a half into the first period, the ice staff got to work on repairing a hole behind goaltender Maggie Hatch\u2019s crease along the boards. The repairs stalled action for roughly five minutes before the players were able to resume play.</p>\n                <p>Penn State played its first game without captain Tessa Janecke (USA), Nicole Hall (Sweden) and Matilde Fantin (Italy) as each of them will be competing in the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games. Mya Vaslet filled Janecke\u2019s spot as the first-line center, playing alongside Katelyn Roberts and Abby Stonehouse.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Vaslet) managed the game really well, and she's really fast, and so that'll allow her speed to help out,\u201d Kampersal said.</p>\n                <p>Taylor Lum and McKenna Walsh moved up to play with Shelby Shane on the third line in the absence of Hall and Fantin.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white didn\u2019t lack offensive firepower, however, as Penn State consistently peppered goaltender Hatch. At the final buzzer, the Nittany Lions outshot the Colonials 42-13.</p>\n                <p>Tensions flared in the early game as the blue and white controlled possession, as the starting forwards Grace Outwater, Maddy Christian and Mikah Keller generated offensive opportunities on the doorstep. Penn State\u2019s physicality prompted a response by the Colonials\u2019 defense as pushing and shoving ensued.</p>\n                <p>With 4:29 remaining in the first period, Keller intercepted a breakout pass in the slot, striding down on the Nittany Lions\u2019 first true open opportunity. Her wrist shot was saved by Hatch\u2019s hot glove.</p>\n                <p>Two minutes later, Penn State got its best chance of the period as Walsh, Lum and Shane surged on a 3-on-0. Walsh deked to Hatch\u2019s glove side and had a step on the goaltender, but her backhand shot was saved by Hatch\u2019s extended pad to keep the game scoreless heading into the first intermission.</p>\n                <p>Robert Morris took its first penalty just under three minutes into the second period. Laura Eustace cross-checked a Nittany Lion in her own defensive end. However, the power play lacked substance and the teams were back to even-strength without incident.</p>\n                <p>Walsh scored the first Division I goal at Beaver Stadium with 7:52 remaining in the second period. Shane gave a backhand pass to Walsh, who seized the moment for her second goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was more excited to get us on the board, because I knew once we got one, we were going to get another,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI was just happy that it went in the back of the net.\u201d</p>\n                <p>And then the floodgates opened. Fifty seconds after the opening goal, Christian followed up with a one-timer courtesy of Outwater\u2019s centering feed to the middle of the slot that found a hole under Hatch\u2019s blocker.</p>\n                <p>The third period slowed the pace of play considerably, with neither team generating key opportunities through most of the frame. Both teams relied on defense to mitigate odd-man rushes and breakaways, leading to a stalemate.</p>\n                <p>However, with 4:22 remaining in the game, Outwater stripped a Colonial defender of the puck in the slot and flicked a shot over Hatch\u2019s glove to take a 3-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions coasted to the final buzzer to improve to 25-4 on the season.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to Pegula Ice Arena tomorrow at 6 p.m. to close out its two-game series against Robert Morris.</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Avery Hill | Football Editor",
    "description": "<p>A lot of hockey will be played in Beaver Stadium, so let\u2019s get weird with it.</p>\n                <p>With their athleticism, physicality and the chance to be esteemed skaters, I decided to build the dream Penn State hockey lineup out of past and present Nittany Lion football players.</p>\n                <p>If Guy Gadowsky is reading this, I\u2019d advise trying talking to the NCAA to approve eligibility waivers to bring a title to Hockey Valley. Anyway, here goes nothing.</p>\n                <p>Left wing: Tyler Warren</p>\n                <p>Let\u2019s get the obvious one out the way. You can\u2019t convince me Tyler Warren doesn\u2019t fit into any sport, including things like water polo, bocce ball and even professional TAG.</p>\n                <p>The only question was what position does Warren fit best. Playing on the left wing will allow him to attack the net, find open skaters and play a bit of defense as well.</p>\n                <p>In emergency situations, Warren easily slots in at goalie or defenseman as well, but goalie would take away a chance for him to make an impact offensively. At 6-foot-6, 258 pounds, he\u2019d be a huge wing, but his presence would make him easily a polarizing force on ice.</p>\n                <p>Center: Michael Robinson</p>\n                <p>Michael Robinson could do just about everything at Penn State, so I\u2019m confident he can win every faceoff too.</p>\n                <p>Robinson would represent yet another jack-of-all-trades for Gadowsky\u2019s squad, becoming a force on the defensive end while being able to dish it to Warren and others offensively.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, the 2005 Big Ten MVP\u2019s skillset includes the stamina to stay on the ice for longer shifts. I may not have ever played hockey, but I think I\u2019ve already built a championship-winning team.</p>\n                <p>Right wing: Saquon Barkley</p>\n                <p>This list is incorrect if SaQuads doesn\u2019t crack the offensive lineup. With freak athleticism paired with strength and skills that likely far surpasses anyone in the NHL currently, he\u2019d be an absolute superstar on the ice.</p>\n                <p>Saquon Barkley would give opponents nightmares anytime he laced the skates up, and his breakaways would be a sight to see.</p>\n                <p>Let Barkley make it to the NHL. Trust me, I\u2019ll be tuned into each All-Star Weekend to watch him put on a show.</p>\n                <p>Defenseman: LaVar Arrington</p>\n                <p>While I\u2019m not sure how much leaping LaVar Arrington will be able to do on the ice, I think he can be a driving force on the defensive end.</p>\n                <p>With the unit already assembled on the offensive end, all Gadowsky needs Arrington to do is deliver body-crushing board checks and become an obstacle near the net.</p>\n                <p>You can really slot any of ST1X C1TY in this position, and even go with Michael Mauti. But I\u2019m sticking with Arrington.</p>\n                <p>Defenseman: John Urschel</p>\n                <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking here. The 300-pound John Urschel has no business on ice. I argue he does.</p>\n                <p>Urschel, who earned his PhD at MIT in mathematics and scored a 43-of-50 on the NFL Wonderlic test, is extremely intelligent. He could be the cerebral captain on this team, though Gadowsky may need to do a bit of load management if he\u2019s on the ice for too long.</p>\n                <p>Even outside of his intellect, Urschel has the strength and the quickness to translate to skills on skates. Pick Urschel, and you get a leader that can help push the team through tough moments in the pursuit of glory.</p>\n                <p>Goalie: Chop Robinson</p>\n                <p>Chop Robinson got off the ball better than just about anyone during his time at Penn State, such reflexes and agility is perfect for playing goalie.</p>\n                <p>Robinson may not enjoy being unable to lunge out and level opposing skaters, but the position would allow him to make plenty of plays for his team.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, his incredible bend would allow for some highlight reel saves at the net, making him a netminder to watch every night he\u2019s out there.</p>\n                <p>Top players off bench: Justin King, wing; Daryus Dixson, Kaytron Allen, center, defenseman; Sean Clifford, goalie</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky\u2019s got a big and physical lineup going so far, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be sent to the penalty box a ton or even suspended, so he\u2019s going to need some key players on his bench.</p>\n                <p>Justin King, who ran a 4.31 40-yard dash, has the speed to either race down to save a short-handed breakaway, or get off on one of his own during the power play.</p>\n                <p>Daryus Dixson has the length and scrapiness to really make a difference defensively, using his stick to become a menace on the defensive end.</p>\n                <p>Kaytron Allen\u2019s motor never stops. Expect him to be aggressive on faceoffs and a presence not to be messed with on a 2-on-1.</p>\n                <p>Then at goalie it\u2019ll be Sean Clifford. A bigger goalie can\u2019t be sustainable for the whole season. Clifford\u2019s IQ and athleticism allows for a change of pace when Robinson\u2019s out for the night, so he\u2019s an easy one to slot in.</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

After the Raiders\u2019 season-opening loss against Penn State, they travelled to Charlottesville, where they lost to No. 5 Virginia by 10 goals.</p>\n                <p>The Raiders won the Patriot League championship last year, getting two ranked wins in the process. The title secured their spot in the NCAA Tournament, setting up a first-round rematch with Penn State, which ended Colgate\u2019s season.</p>\n                <p>Colgate had three players with 67 or more points in 2025, but all three either transferred or graduated after the season. Its most productive returner will be senior midfielder Hunter Drouin, who had 48 points for the Raiders last year.</p>\n                <p>Drouin was named a preseason All-American honorable mention by Inside Lacrosse ahead of the 2026 season, a recognition he also received prior to his last campaign.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State, the biggest challenge will be figuring out how to succeed in the post-Matt Traynor era. Traynor scored 153 points as a Nittany Lion, 61 of which came in his senior season.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019ll be replaced on the first midfield line by star sophomore Hunter Aquino, who scored 37 points in a freshman campaign that saw him be named Big Ten Freshman of the Year and a second-team All-American by Inside Lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>The Easton, Pennsylvania, native has already been named a preseason second-team All-American by Inside Lacrosse, joining fellow second-teamer Alex Ross and honorable mention Jon King.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads the all-time series with Colgate 16-10. The Raiders\u2019 last win against the Nittany Lions came in 2024 when they secured a 13-12 victory in that year\u2019s season opener.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>One of the most highly anticipated matchups of the 2025-26 season for Penn State will take place on Friday when the Nittany Lions host Nebraska inside the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have dominated the <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/wrestling/series-history-penn-state-faces-nebraska-for-20th-all-time-matchup/article_9d74b68e-34e7-4610-81d4-261c991426ea.html\" target=\"_blank\">series history</a>, with Cael Sanderson holding the edge since he took over in Happy Valley over Cornhuskers\u2019 head coach Mark Manning.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how each matchup breaks down.</p>\n                <p>125 pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. Alan Koehler (NU)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl will take on the lone unranked wrestler in the entire dual in Alan Koehler. Lilledahl is the top wrestler at 125 pounds, and will have the easiest matchup of the entire dual.</p>\n                <p>The 125-pound bout is likely to start off the dual and could be the quickest of the matches with Lilledahl\u2019s style of wrestling. He could go on the attack early and often, scoring a lot of points en route to a possible bonus-point victory.</p>\n                <p>133 pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 10 Jacob Van Dee (NU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze will have another major test with Jacob Van Dee on Friday. Van Dee is 12-3 and dropped from his No. 8 ranking after losing to Ben Davino of Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>Blaze will take on Davino in two weeks when Ohio State faces the Nittany Lions in the second BJC dual. With Blaze\u2019s low style, it\u2019ll be tough for Van Dee to score points, as Blaze has restricted points all season. In his freshman year, he\u2019s well in contention to win the Big Ten and national title.</p>\n                <p>141 pounds: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 4 Brock Hardy (NU)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis\u2019 stamina will be put to the test against Brock Hardy. Hardy, just like Van Dee, fell against Ohio State to a highly ranked wrestler when he lost to Jesse Mendez.</p>\n                <p>Mendez appears to be in a tier of his own so it didn\u2019t come as a surprise when Hardy lost. Now, Hardy will take on Davis, who\u2019s starting to find more and more comfort at his new weight class.</p>\n                <p>If Davis can hold up stamina wise, things could get interesting down the stretch.</p>\n                <p>149 pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 18 Chance Lamer (NU)</p>\n                <p>This is the first of the gauntlet of wrestlers Penn State brings to the lineup. Shayne Van Ness is the top wrestler at 149 pounds and has showcased an unreal gas tank as of late. Van Ness is coming off the back of a 31-point performance against Maryland after nearly getting pinned.</p>\n                <p>Chance Lamer, who only has three losses on the season despite his No. 18 ranking, will have to step up his game even more to take down Van Ness, who\u2019s proved he\u2019s taken another step from his redshirt sophomore year.</p>\n                <p>157 pounds: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. No. 5 Antrell Taylor (NU)</p>\n                <p>Another test for the highly regarded freshman.</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke will take on Antrell Taylor, the 2025 National Champion, in a match to really see where Duke is in his freshman year. After a slower start, Taylor appears poised to get back the national title match.</p>\n                <p>Taylor will be the big test for Duke, and if Duke comes out on top, it\u2019ll be all eyes on two weeks from now, when the freshman phenom takes on No. 1 Brandon Cannon.</p>\n                <p>165 pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 7 LJ Araujo (NU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink continues to raise his level, asserting himself as one of the favorites for the Hodge Trophy. LJ Araujo has shown signs of potential, already ranking No. 7 in the country, while holding an 11-5 record.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink is on another level from any wrestler he\u2019s faced this season. Araujo fell to Mikey Caliendo of Iowa, a wrestler Mesenbrink is 7-0 against. All signs point to another big win for Mesenbrink as there\u2019s yet to be a wrestler to keep it close with the Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>174 pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 4 Christopher Minto (NU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines is another wrestler who\u2019s raised his style to another level. Haines made the powerful jump last season, focusing on back points, something Mesenbrink is doing this season. He\u2019ll face Christopher Minto, who\u2019s 14-3 on the season compared to Haines\u2019 14-0 record.</p>\n                <p>Minto fell to Patrick Kennedy on Jan. 23, a wrestler that Haines has a 3-0 record against. Similar to Mesenbrink, that matchup against the Iowa wrestler could be the overall deciding factor, with Haines poised to get back to the top of the podium.</p>\n                <p>184 pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 6 Silas Allred (NU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh is up to No. 1 after his victory over Angelo Ferrari. Welsh will face Silas Allred, who appears to be in the second grouping of wrestlers nationally at 184 pounds. The top group features both Welsh and Ferrari in addition to Minnesota\u2019s Max McEnelly and Missouri\u2019s Aeoden Sinclair.</p>\n                <p>Allred could make a statement, but the momentum could be fully on the Nittany Lions\u2019 side by this point, proving to be too much against Welsh, who\u2019s given up minimal points across the entire season.</p>\n                <p>197 pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 9 Camden McDanel (NU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr is another Penn State wrestler who appears to be in a tier of his own. Camden McDanel has proven himself as an All-American threat, but taking down Barr will be a whole different task.</p>\n                <p>Barr has just two losses in the last 12 months, also holding one of the biggest moments of the BJC duals last season when he defeated Jacob Cardenas in tiebreakers.</p>\n                <p>McDanel is 14-4, while Barr sits at 12-0. Since Barr\u2019s return from injury, he\u2019s undefeated and remains dominant, culminating in another potential dominant performance from the Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>285 pounds: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. 4 AJ Ferrari (NU)</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola will take on AJ Ferrari to likely close out the dual \u2014 if the dual begins at 125 pounds like it typically does. Ferrari and Mirasola match up well weight wise, with the Cornhusker jumping to heavyweight this season after wrestling at 197 pounds a year ago.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola has performed well against wrestlers closer to his size, but Ferrari\u2019s unique style could cause issues. The match will likely be very low scoring as Ferrari has a more conservative style of wrestling, but could overpower Mirasola with his strength if the opportunity arises.</p>\n                <p>Based on the lineups, the dual will likely be out of hand by this point, but could play a major factor in rankings, Big Ten seeding and even NCAA Tournament seeding when the calendar turns to March.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 5 Penn State will take on Illinois in a Big Ten matchup at 1 p.m. on Sunday at Rec Hall. The match will be in support of THON. Last week, the Nittany Lions tied with Illinois in the Sam Mikulak Invitational at second place with a score of 317.650.</p>\n                <p>This season, Penn State sits at 1-0 in individual matches outside of tournament play, where it has finished 1st and 2nd. In the last competition, it performed well across the board, which greatly improved its score. With that, the Nittany Lions still have room to improve, which they will try to bring into this rematch.</p>\n                <p>In Florida, they weren\u2019t able to have all of their best gymnasts in the lineup, but are expecting them to be out on the floor Sunday. During the routines in Florida, Brayden Erickson put up the second-best floor routine of his collegiate career at a 13.050. Matt Underhill followed him with a 13.550, which was just a tenth short of his season high.</p>\n                <p>In addition to these record-breaking routines, three other Nittany Lions posted some of the highest scores of their careers, including Bobby Alessio with a 12.850 on the pommel horse, Ritam Malik with a 13.800, his best score of the season on any skill and Ricky Perez with a personal best of 13.650.</p>\n                <p>With all of these record-breaking scores, Penn State is coming into this matchup strong. Illinois arrives in this matchup with a record of 0-3-1, placing 4th at the OSU Open, and the runner-up finish in the last tournament, facing Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Illini showed strength on the rings events, scoring a 52.700 at the OSU Open and a high performance from Hasan Aydogdu, with a 14.500 in the Sam Milulak Invitational, keeping them in close range to Penn State. The rings will be a category to watch closely at this meet, with many competitors achieving over 14 points on both sides. It could be a determining factor in the outcome of the overall match.</p>\n                <p>Other high-performing categories for the Fighting Illini are pommel horse, with two competitors scoring over 14. That includes Preston Ngai with a 14.350 and Brandon Dang sporting a 14.650. The highest score a Nittany Lion has achieved on the pommel horse this season was a 13.850 by Landon Simpson in the Sam Milulak Invitational.</p>\n                <p>This competition is expected to feature close scores, requiring both squads to ensure their top athletes are healthy and ready to perform their best routines. The outcome of this matchup will help set the tone for future conference matchups. Both teams will compete against Michigan, Ohio State and Nebraska down the line.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Brennan Kramp I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s official \u2014 A$AP Rocky is back. After nearly a decade spent making some switches to his life in a more mature and adult fashion, dealing with some incredibly unfortunate and somewhat nasty endeavors, A$AP Rocky has put out his much anticipated fifth studio album, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb,\u201d to already incredible acclaim.</p>\n                <p>On just the first day of its release, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb\u201d amassed over 35,000,000 Spotify streams and is projected to sell just under 120,000 units of vinyl.</p>\n                <p>This doesn\u2019t come as much of a shock as the long awaited return stems all the way back to when Rocky quietly whisked himself away from music for about eight years after his 2018 album \u201cTesting.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Since his last release, Rocky has welcomed three kids with Rihanna, entered the fashion and film industry and \u2014 to put it simply \u2014 was going through it.</p>\n                <p>Now nearing 40, Rocky is back with \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb,\u201d an album that subverts expectations people have for artists as they mature. While many popular artists begin to lose their stride after they\u2019ve hit their prime, on \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb,\u201d Rocky shows that he still has plenty left in the bag.</p>\n                <p>The album opens with the humble and ballsy jam, \u201cORDER OF PROTECTION\u201d that delivers the truth from the source with Rocky starting the track by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been a lil\u2019 while since I been in the league / A couple lil\u2019 trials, couple of leaks.\u201d Right away, Rocky makes sure the audience knows the context of this project before unloading a producer masterclass on the rest of the album.</p>\n                <p>Following the opener are two heavy-hitting, true-to-form A$AP Rocky tracks in \u201cHELICOPTER\u201d and \u201cSTOLE YA FLOW,\u201d with the latter being Rocky\u2019s diss track to Drake. Here, Rocky takes that same energy seen on \u201cHELICOPTER\u201d and uses it to deliver a right hook to Drake\u2019s already banged-up ego.</p>\n                <p>Drake, famously trampled in his \u201cbeef\u201d with fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar in 2024, also had a well known on-again off-again relationship with Rocky\u2019s now wife Rihanna. \u201cSTOLE YA FLOW\u201d hits on a different level lyrically, as Rocky not only flaunts the fact that he stole Drake\u2019s once-love, but disses Drake\u2019s musicianship saying, \u201cFirst you stole my flow, so I stole yo\u2019 b \u2014.\u201d Kendrick Lamar may have delivered the final blow, but Rocky nailed the coffin shut.</p>\n                <p>After his ruthless yet poised attack on Drake, Rocky eases you into a R&amp;B soaked jam in \u201cSTAY HERE 4 LIFE\u201d featuring the rising hip-hop star Brent Faiyaz. A mellowed out tune about the processes of embracing life after a tumultuous time \u2014 whether it be fame, fatherhood, music or love, Faiyaz perfectly compliments Rocky\u2019s message on this track, as an ode to his life outside of the studio \u2014 showing love to his wife and kids as he enters back into the music scene.</p>\n                <p>One of the more unique songs on the album comes from \u201cPUNK ROCKY,\u201d a fabulous merger of early 2020\u2019s New York alternative and late modern R&amp;B. An angsty and heartfelt song where the fusion of alternative sound with Rocky\u2019s traditional rap flow makes for an intriguing listen as you get to see yet another side of Rocky\u2019s production capabilities.</p>\n                <p>Another semi-experimental song with so much class and ingenuity is the album's 13th track, \u201cROBBERY\u201d featuring Doechii. On \u201cROBBERY,\u201d Rocky lays down an intimate, smokey tune supported with some acoustic bass and drum kit pulled right off the stage of a late-night speakeasy bar.</p>\n                <p>The chemistry between Rocky and Doechii in this musical back-and-forth is perfectly complimented by the jazzy production on the track, giving a low-lit and sensual vibe. It\u2019s a song where you can actually feel the inspiration and level of commitment behind what you\u2019re hearing.</p>\n                <p>The closing track on the album is \u201cFISH N STEAK (WHAT IS IT),\u201d featuring Tyler, The Creator and Jozzy. Here, Rocky closes the door on the album with an ultra-slowed down tune designed to produce sweet sounding, melodic and chill vibes, throwing in some DJ-vinyl-scratch samples, flute, harp and traditional drum and snare to give his closer an authentically classic feel that reminds you of his early rise and long awaited return.</p>\n                <p>There are several other songs on the album that are absolute speaker boomers as well. \u201cSTOP SNITCHING\u201d featuring BossMan Dlow and Sauce Walka, \u201cAIR FORCE (BLACK DEMARCO) and \u201cTHE END\u201d featuring will.i.am and Jessica Pratt, just to name a few.</p>\n                <p>Overall, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb\u201d is not only great for music culture, but it also represents something bigger in Rocky\u2019s career. In the current trends of popular music, a lot of the industry has been dumbed down by in-and-out acts \u2014 propelled by singles featured on TikTok trends and commercials \u2014 yet there are still veteran members of popular music that can leave for nearly a decade and come back to produce a smash hit album just for the love of the game.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you're like me, you eat, sleep and breathe coffee. I go to bed every night genuinely excited to wake up and drink my next cup.</p>\n                <p>A hobby of mine is trying local coffee shops and seeing what unique creations each place has to offer. Here are some of the best local places in downtown State College and beyond to get your caffeine fix.</p>\n                <p>Elixr</p>\n                <p>With a charming atmosphere, Elixr has such a quintessential coffee shop vibe to it.</p>\n                <p>I tried their hot cappuccino, and it was delicious. There was an adorable latte art flower on mine, and the attention to detail here certainly did not disappoint.</p>\n                <p>My friends ordered one of their signature drinks \u2014 an iced strawberry oatmilk latte. If coffee is not your favorite, Elixr boasts a wide range of matchas as well.</p>\n                <p>Overall, the price was affordable and the atmosphere was adorable, so I will be returning.</p>\n                <p>Irving\u2019s</p>\n                <p>Known best for their homemade bagels, Irving\u2019s also has an espresso machine, and their coffee is some of my favorite downtown.</p>\n                <p>There is plenty of seating upstairs, downstairs and outside, which is great for larger groups looking to sit together. My go-to that never disappoints is an iced caramel latte with an extra shot of espresso (paired with a breakfast sandwich, of course).</p>\n                <p>I particularly love Irving\u2019s dedication to curating special holiday and seasonal drinks.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Irving\u2019s is well known for its wide variety of homemade smoothies if you are looking for an alternate drink option. Definitely a place that offers great coffee and food for a reasonable price, and one I will certainly go back to.</p>\n                <p>Vibe Coffee Co.</p>\n                <p>This vibrant place is the perfect spot to sit with a friend. The adorable decor, large windows and bright lighting add to the atmosphere of this coffee shop.</p>\n                <p>I ordered one of their custom Penn State-themed iced lattes and it was delicious. A fun feature of Vibe is that they offer coffee flights so you can try multiple different flavors of their lattes, and split coffee cups where you enjoy two different drinks in the same vessel.</p>\n                <p>Vibe uses farm-fresh milk and you can genuinely taste such a huge difference in the quality as well as the freshness.</p>\n                <p>If you are looking for other options, they also make their own fresh-squeezed lemonade. With moderately priced items and quality coffee, Vibe is a must-visit place downtown.</p>\n                <p>Bagel Crust</p>\n                <p>With two downtown locations, Bagel Crust is probably not your first thought when you think of a morning coffee.</p>\n                <p>However, I have found they offer the least expensive coffee in State College by far.</p>\n                <p>I ordered an iced coffee with a splash of milk, and it was very refreshing with a bold flavor. Additionally, the seating at Bagel Crust is pretty vast, and lots of space is available.</p>\n                <p>Sowers Harvest Cafe</p>\n                <p>Offering healthy cuisine and a wide range of custom drinks, Sowers makes an incredible iced caramel latte.</p>\n                <p>With farm-fresh milk, their coffee is always rich, creamy and flavorful. Sowers boasts very affordable pricing, given that most of their ingredients are locally sourced.</p>\n                <p>The indoor and outdoor seating offers plenty of options for large groups and the atmosphere provides such a comforting and calming energy.</p>\n                <p>I highly recommend stopping by for coffee or lunch.</p>\n                <p>Pump Station</p>\n                <p>Located just outside of State College in Boalsburg, Pump Station is an aesthetic gas station-themed coffee shop that even has a drive-thru.</p>\n                <p>The decorations inside include vintage wall decor and historical gas station displays, sure to make you feel like you\u2019re getting \u201cfuel\u201d for your car and not you.</p>\n                <p>I ordered a cold brew with vanilla cold foam \u2014 you can get it in any flavor you want, and it was the perfect balance of boldness and creamy vanilla essence.</p>\n                <p>Pump Station offers plenty of seating near large garage-esque windows. With moderate pricing, it is definitely worth the five-minute drive outside of downtown.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Skylar Williamson I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 1, the pressure of choosing a New Year\u2019s resolution starts all over again, just as it did the year before. People can sometimes find themselves stuck on what they can improve during the next 12 months.</p>\n                <p>The viral 75 Hard Challenge combines physical and mental components that intrigue people on the internet, with rules that create the perfect concoction for a healthy new year.</p>\n                <p>The challenge was created in 2019 by Andy Frisella, a podcaster and motivational speaker. He described his challenge as a \u201cmental toughness,\u201d less concerned with losing weight and more about building self confidence and determination.</p>\n                <p>Like many fitness challenges, 75 Hard grew through social media. During COVID-19, millions of people spent their time inside trying to stay in shape, waiting for the world to open back up.</p>\n                <p>The hashtag \u201875Hard\u2019 now has over a million posts on Instagram and millions more spread over different social platforms, especially TikTok.</p>\n                <p>The main rules of the challenge seem simple: follow a healthy diet, perform two 45-minute workouts a day \u2014 one must be outdoors \u2014 and no alcohol.</p>\n                <p>The other daily rules include drinking one gallon of water, reading 10 pages of a nonfiction book and taking a progress photo, but the catch is slipping up equals starting over from day one.</p>\n                <p>The first step is choosing the right diet for whoever is doing the challenge.</p>\n                <p>Penny Kris-Etherton said people are attracted to a flexible diet, which is shown in the 2025 update from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) with its new slogan: \u201cEat Healthy Your Way!\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cA healthy diet can be implemented in a lot of different ways,\u201d Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition, said. \u201cConsistency with that diet is important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said younger generations like to do things \u201ctheir way\u201d and that\u2019s what 75 Hard gives them the opportunity to do.</p>\n                <p>The physical activity part of the challenge is just as flexible as the dieting. The only strict part is one of the two daily exercises needs to be outside.</p>\n                <p>Travis Masterson said the 75 Hard Challenge gives people the freedom to adjust their exercising to their own lifestyles.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen we look at successful weight-loss programs, it's (75 Hard) about the level of exercise we recommend in a day anyway,\u201d Masterson, an assistant professor, said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that they keep it very vague because that\u2019s going to mean different things for different people.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Exercise can be a walk in the park with your friends, and for people looking for a challenge, it can be a full-body workout in the gym. Bottomline, increasing physical activity is the overall goal.</p>\n                <p>Masterson said figuring out not only what is best for the body, but what will stick long term, is important to be aware of.</p>\n                <p>\u201cRather than building very strict rule sets around things, it\u2019s (75 Hard) teaching you to be disciplined and consistent with whatever you can do,\u201d Masterson said. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of why it\u2019s so valuable.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Removing alcohol is where the concerns of 75 Hard come in. Michael Russell said if a person who drinks frequently cuts out alcohol, there are several changes that are apparent over time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you cut out alcohol for a long period of time, your sleep quality will start to improve pretty dramatically,\u201d Russell, an assistant professor, said. \u201cFor young adults, the other thing you will see is a lot more emotional regulation.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Although this seems like the hardest part for every college student, cutting out alcohol can significantly improve their quality of life if taken seriously, according to Russell. Having \u201changxiety\u201d is just one example of the negative effects of drinking.</p>\n                <p>Russell said the downside of the 75 Hard Challenge is the rebound effect it can have, especially with alcohol.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible if someone drinks when they\u2019re out with friends and messes up the challenge, they will just drink more because the challenge is now over and they have to start over,\u201d Russell said.</p>\n                <p>Overall though, the benefits of the challenge are undeniable \u2014 it can be used as an effective starting point for a healthier life.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGetting people on the track to just thinking about their health is a huge step forward,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.</p>\n                <p>As the viral challenge progressed over the years, people started creating their own versions and adding personal goals, like getting eight hours of sleep daily. A lighter version of 75 Hard is 75 Soft, where people follow similar rules to the original challenge but give themselves more leeway for failure.</p>\n                <p>The 75 Hard Challenge allows people to take their own individual goals and put them into something that is about more than just losing weight, making it a good New Year\u2019s resolution.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a comprehensive program with nutrition and physical activity included but also reading books,\u201d Kris-Etherton said. \u201cThat\u2019s what health is. It's not just one thing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

This is the third Big Ten opponent for the Nittany Lions so far, and they look strong as they head east.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white are coming off three straight wins after narrowly beating Maryland in their meet up on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights are coming off a loss against Washington, which was their second Big Ten matchup of the season. The first was Ohio State, which resulted in a loss, as well. Rutgers competed in and won two tri-meets to start off its season, but has yet to make a splash in the Big Ten season. It hopes to get a win against the Nittany Lions this weekend.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has been a strong force at the beginning of this season, putting up great scores across the board and keeping the good times going with win after win. The blue and white seem to be particularly strong on vault and bars, really creating a lineup of gymnasts that are both strong in both of these events.</p>\n                <p>Ava Piedrahita and Elizabeth Leary are all over the score sheet for the Nittany Lions, and like against Maryland last weekend, these two gymnasts have been consistently putting up great scores on vault and beam. Leary had a strong weekend, going 9.825 on vault and 9.875 on bars. Piedrahita went 9.900 on both events, leading the scoring for the blue and white in both events.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have a really great rotation going on. Ellie Monahan, Dani Latronica, Kalea McElligott, as well as Leary and Piedrahita, are in constant rotation for Penn State. With McElligott and Monahan both putting up 9.800 plus on both floor and beam, the team has the opportunity to do really well against not only Rutgers but also other Big Ten teams.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers has a few gymnasts who are really strong all-around, or in more than just one event. Gabrielle Dildy was a top performer in the Ball State Tri meet against Ball State and Western Michigan. Dildy put up a 9.825 on beam and a 9.850 on vault, which won her individual all-around and vault awards.</p>\n                <p>In the Rutgers Tri meet against Temple and Brockport, Delaney Adrian was a standout as an all-around gymnast. Adrian scored first on beam with a score of 9.825, and also took home a personal best of 9.875 on floor.</p>\n                <p>Emily Leese was also really valuable for the Scarlet Knights in the Rutgers Tri meet, but has been contributing to high vault scores so far this season. Leese scored a 9.900 on vault against Temple and Brockport, and then scored a 9.850, coming in first on vault against Washington this past Friday.</p>\n                <p>If Rutgers plays its cards right and creates a really great lineup for this weekend, it can send the Nittany Lions home with their first loss of the season. Both of these teams have the ability to cover all of their bases with talent and have depth in their rosters.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The start of the 2026 baseball season is almost here. As the Nittany Lions prepare to suit up for action, fans supporting the blue and white are doing the same.</p>\n                <p>Given the hectic nature of our daily lives, watching all 55 regular-season games is a tall task. Below is a guide to three games you should circle on your calendars.</p>\n                <p>These are the nonnegotiables.</p>\n                <p>Feb. 15: Kansas State (MLB Desert Invitational)</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s first test.</p>\n                <p>There is nothing like baseball in February. Sure, it\u2019s freezing cold in State College, but across the country, the blue and white will be competing in the warm state of Arizona for its first set of action.</p>\n                <p>The MLB Desert Invitational grants a favorable slate of three games for Penn State, which will take on Air Force and Grand Canyon before facing Kansas State.</p>\n                <p>The Wildcats were a respectable team competing out of the Big 12 and finished with a 32-26 record last season. While Kansas State was very solid at home, tallying an 18-3 record, the team was just 7-4 on neutral sites. Penn State finished last year with a 4-2 record on neutral sites, making this matchup an even battle.</p>\n                <p>Both teams possess similar strengths as each ranked among the best hitting teams in college baseball last season. Kansas State ranked 23rd among the entire poll last year in home runs, hitting 97 in 58 games. The Nittany Lions weren\u2019t too far behind at 47th, hitting 81 homers in 56 games.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Wildcats losing talent to the MLB, the team has been on the rise. In the last two seasons, Kansas State has reached the NCAA Tournament twice. This will be a good early test for two very even teams.</p>\n                <p>March 6-8: at Texas Tech (three-game series)</p>\n                <p>A sneaky nonconference test.</p>\n                <p>To this point, Penn State would have a decent amount of baseball under its belt. While March Madness serves as the highly coveted college sports event of this month, college baseball presents a unique show of its own.</p>\n                <p>For the blue and white, this will mark a major nonconference series ahead of Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>In the offseason, Penn State went to the portal to snag <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/baseball/penn-state-baseball-inks-texas-tech-transfer-greg-minnick/article_c3f99683-bac1-4468-add4-d340bf75d4b4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Minnick</a>, a former highly-touted recruit, who signed with Texas Tech out of high school. That may have fueled an even better duel, yet to be seen on the diamond.</p>\n                <p>Aside from looking ahead to Penn State\u2019s schedule, Texas Tech will start out with an SEC gauntlet. Having to face Oklahoma, Vanderbilt and Arkansas, it\u2019ll be a great identity test for the Red Raiders early on.</p>\n                <p>This will give a good indication of what to expect when Penn State opens up Big Ten play. After finishing last season with a subpar 20-33 record, the Red Raiders are receiving hype for a better upcoming season.</p>\n                <p>After reloading in the portal and on the recruiting trail, Texas Tech has balance across its roster. This seems like another evenly matched opponent for the Nittany Lions, who could be in for a surprising upset in early March.</p>\n                <p>April 24-26: at Oregon (three-game series)</p>\n                <p>Heading across the country for a quality Big Ten opponent.</p>\n                <p>All the talk of the town in 2026 college baseball has centered around the team in the West. And no, it\u2019s not the Oregon Ducks.</p>\n                <p>The UCLA Bruins are the team to beat. Nevertheless, Penn State will not face them in the regular season. Luckily, or unluckily, the Nittany Lions will get a stab at another Big Ten foe from the West in Oregon.</p>\n                <p>Besides serving as a premier site in college baseball, PK Park presents an intimidating atmosphere, one that is hard for opposing teams to win. In recent years, the Ducks have emerged as one of the top units in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Seeking its sixth-straight NCAA Tournament appearance, Oregon is coming off a highly successful year in 2025. The Ducks tallied a 42-16 overall record and went 22-8 in Big Ten play, finishing as the Big Ten regular-season co-champion with UCLA.</p>\n                <p>Like Texas Tech, the Ducks will be tested early on in their neutral-site contests. Playing in the \u201cLive Like Lou Las Vegas College Baseball Class,\u201d Oregon will face the likes of Vanderbilt and UC Irvine. Following that, they will face Oregon State at home. All three of those opponents were Tournament teams last season.</p>\n                <p>In Perfect Game\u2019s Preseason Top 25, the Ducks placed at No. 13. Given the national preseason attention and coach Mark Wasikowski\u2019s vast winning continuity, Oregon will pose a major threat to the Nittany Lions in 2026.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Column | Projecting Bridget Nemeth's stateline after missing 2025 season",
    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The most victories in a single-season by any pitcher in Penn State softball history, top five in both strikeouts and innings pitched in a single campaign, unanimous First-Team All-Big Ten, Big Ten Freshman of the Year and a top-40 ERA in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Those are just some of the many accomplishments that Bridget Nemeth has achieved in her career as a Nittany Lion. The catch, Nemeth achieved all of them in just one season.</p>\n                <p>The junior right-hander had arguably the best freshman season and pitching performances in program history. Given her rookie year success, the Glendora, California, native had plenty of eyes on her ahead of her sophomore season. However, Nemeth was sidelined for 2025 due to an undisclosed injury.</p>\n                <p>Those eyes now turn to the 2026 season to see how Nemeth\u2019s return to the circle will play out.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look at some projected stat lines for Nemeth\u2019s upcoming junior campaign.</p>\n                <p>ERA and nonconference opponents</p>\n                <p>In 2024, Nemeth\u2019s 1.77 ERA finished second in the Big Ten. In 2026, the junior will have to face some tough lineups right from the get-go. The blue and white are scheduled to face four Power 4 teams in its first five games.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s safe to assume that Nemeth won\u2019t get the starting nod in all of these, but she\u2019ll certainly be on stand by. The one in particular to look out for is when Penn State takes on BYU on Feb. 7.</p>\n                <p>The Cougars\u2019 .308 team batting average finished third in the Big 12 and top-50 nationally. The hitter that poses the biggest threat to Nemeth and company is sophomore Ilove\u2019a Brittingham. The Nipomo, California, native\u2019s .410 batting average and 69 RBI placed third in the conference, additionally her 21 home runs finished second.</p>\n                <p>The opponents only get tougher as the month goes on, as the Nittany Lions travel to Knoxville for two games against ESPN/USA Softball preseason No. 4 Tennessee.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Vols lost Taylor Pannell, who was one of the SEC\u2019s most productive hitters last year, to the transfer portal, but gained a batting gem in Boise State transfer Sophia Knight.</p>\n                <p>Knight set a Mountain West record last campaign with 103 hits, and she was also the only player in Division I softball to record an 100 hit season. The junior also finished with the nation's third-best batting average at .486.</p>\n                <p>Knight\u2019s going to be one of the toughest bats that Nemeth has to face, and they\u2019ll likely have to battle multiple times. This factor could either make or break Nemeth\u2019s ERA early on in the season, and possibly set the tone for the rest.</p>\n                <p>Given the state of Penn State\u2019s early schedule, I think heading into conference play, Nemeth will post an ERA close to 3.00.</p>\n                <p>ERA and Big Ten competition</p>\n                <p>It won\u2019t get much easier for Nemeth when conference play comes around, starting in mid-March. The Nittany Lions\u2019 opening and closing Big Ten series is where Nemeth will likely find her toughest battles.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opens conference play with a trip to Eugene to face preseason No.5 Oregon, and will close it by hosting preseason No.9 Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>Both opponents ranked top-three in the Big Ten and top-10 nationally when it came to batting average and total hits.</p>\n                <p>Oregon\u2019s best returning hitter is sophomore infielder Rylee McCoy, who reached single-season program highs a year ago with a tied best 19 home runs and top-ranked 32 extra-base hits.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska returns a strong pair of senior bats in reigning Big Ten Player of the Year Jordyn Frahm and Ava Kuszak. Both finished with top-15 batting averages in the Big Ten. Frahm\u2019s .462 average was also enough for sixth nationally. Additionally, both Frahm and Kuszak finished in the top-11 in the conference in hits.</p>\n                <p>Kuszak is the only one of these hitters that Nemeth has already faced, meeting in 2024 when Kuszak was at Wisconsin. The then-Badger went 1-for-3 with a double and a strikeout.</p>\n                <p>As Nemeth has some tough tasks ahead of her, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll post an ERA as low as she did in her freshman campaign, instead I think she\u2019ll finish near the 2.00-2.15 range.</p>\n                <p>Strikeouts</p>\n                <p>In 2024, Nemeth tossed 202 strikeouts, becoming the fourth Nittany Lion to surpass 200 in a season. This also put her third in the conference in total strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>I think it\u2019ll be hard for Nemeth to reach 200 strikeouts again, but it\u2019s certainly possible. My prediction is that her final total will be somewhere between 185 and 200.</p>\n                <p>Victories</p>\n                <p>Nemeth holds the single-season program record with 23 victories. It\u2019s hard to predict how she\u2019ll fare in the win column without knowing how many appearances Nemeth will see this season.</p>\n                <p>Assuming that, like in 2024, Nemeth appears in more than half of Penn State\u2019s games, then I think she could reach 20 victories once again.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>With a 1-4 record on the road, Penn State visited Northwestern in hopes of earning its first conference win and first win in January.</p>\n                <p>That record didn\u2019t get any better Thursday night, though, as the Nittany Lions now find themselves in an eight-game losing streak after falling to the Wildcats 94-73 to remain winless in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Ivan Juri\u0107 won the opening tipoff, giving the blue and white a prime opportunity to get off on the right foot, but a Josh Reed turnover led to a Max Green three-pointer that put the Wildcats on the board first.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades entered Thursday\u2019s match with a 1-2 record over Northwestern, and the fourth meeting was getting off to a good start.</p>\n                <p>The two foes were trading three pointers in the early running of the first half when an Eli Rice long-range basket tied the affair at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>Rice entered the contest against the Wildcats as Penn State\u2019s most efficient three-point shooter, knocking down 45.4% of his attempts from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern was quickly seizing control in the early stages of the game but Rice knocked down his ninth point to once again tie it back up as he went 3-4 from three-point distance, hoping to stay hot.</p>\n                <p>Though the Wildcats had been in control so far, Penn State took its first lead of the night when Freddie Dilione V called his own number on a drive to the basket for his second basket of the night.</p>\n                <p>Met with contact, Dilione was gifted a trip to the charity stripe and took advantage to put the Nittany Lions up 20-19.</p>\n                <p>Consecutive Wildcat misses from right under the basket gave the Nittany Lions a golden opportunity to dig into their 35-30 deficit, but a failed Kayden Mingo driving layup put an end to those hopes.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern immediately capitalized and grabbed onto a seven-point lead after a Tre Singleton close-range make. Singleton, averaging 7.6 points per game, was up to nine points against the blue and white with three minutes to play in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Shooting 59% from the field and out-rebounding Penn State 13-10, the Wildcats held a slim 41-39 lead at the two-minute media timeout.</p>\n                <p>Despite Northwestern holding the lead for nearly nine-and-a-half minutes longer than the blue and white, it was still anyone\u2019s game with the first half winding down.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u010b knocked down an and-one for Penn State\u2019s 10th free throw in as many attempts, as well as his ninth point of the game, after getting fouled on his way to the basket to make it a 41-40 game in the late stages of the half.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back Nick Martinelli baskets were the only remaining bit of action in the first half, and the Wildcats left their home court for the halftime break holding a 45-40 advantage, though the Nittany Lions felt they were within reach of their first conference win.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got on the board first in the second half with Reed making just one of two free throws.</p>\n                <p>Shortly after, Mingo poked the rock out, picking up a steal, but getting fouled on the shot, which ended up being a beneficial foul for the Wildcats as Mingo could only convert one of two from the charity stripe. Mingo\u2019s miss was just Penn State\u2019s second of the night from the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>A Dilione turnover led to a two-handed slam from Angelo Ciaravino off the fast break, as the Wildcats seized a 55-44 lead, followed by a discombobulated Penn State taking a timeout.</p>\n                <p>A mid-range Martinelli jumper gave him his 24th point of the night and a personal milestone \u2013 his 17th 20-plus point performance this season, the most in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern\u2019s 13-point lead faded into a 60-53 edge after back-to-back scores from Reed, followed by an unassisted Mingo score, capitalizing on a Wildcat turnover.</p>\n                <p>A big slam from Juri\u010b was the final score of Penn State\u2019s run after Northwestern snapped it with a Singleton basket that was followed by a Ciaravino three-pointer.</p>\n                <p>With just over nine minutes left to play, back-to-back Mingo makes from the charity stripe made it a 67-61 Wildcat lead, but Martinelli quickly called his own name once more on the and-one as he moved up to 27 points on the night.</p>\n                <p>Consecutive blue and white turnovers led to Northwestern\u2019s largest lead of the night, as the Wildcats grabbed a 76-61 advantage with just about six minutes to play, not fully closing the door, but feeling pretty comfortable against a Nittany Lion team that was in the midst of a three-minute scoring drought.</p>\n                <p>Martinelli moved up to 32 points after three-consecutive free-throw makes on different possessions, putting him just two points away from his career-high 34 points that he set against Rutgers earlier this year.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern just kept hammering away to make sure its lead would be insurmountable, as it commanded an 84-66 lead with just over three minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>On the way to nailing the coffin shut, Martinelli matched his career-high thanks to the help of a season-high of four three-point makes.</p>\n                <p>The action may have stopped there for Martinelli, but not the rest of the Wildcats, as Ciaravino went over 20 points and a couple more three-pointers went in on the way to a 94-73 Northwestern victory.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Entering Thursday\u2019s game, Tibor Mirti\u010d was listed as \u201cquestionable,\u201d rehabbing a knee injury, but he did not play against Northwestern.</p>\n                <p>Sa\u015ba Ciani was also missing from action against the Wildcats, listed as \u201cout,\u201d with an \u201cundisclosed injury.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action when it hosts Minnesota this Sunday at the Bryce Jordan Center in the first game of February.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions look to snap their 8-game losing streak against the 10-11 Golden Gophers.

    "description": "<p>After eager anticipation from the Happy Valley faithful, Penn State\u2019s 2026 schedule has been released, marking the first slate of games where Matt Campbell will be leading the Nittany Lions from the sidelines.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 2026 schedule:9/5: Marshall9/12: Temple (Lincoln Financial Field)9/19: Buffalo9/26: Wisconsin10/3: @ Northwestern10/10: USC10/17: @ Michigan10/24: Bye10/31: Purdue11/7: @ Washington11/14: Minnesota11/21: Rutgers11/27: @ Maryland&mdash; Lyle Alenstein (@LAlenstein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LAlenstein/status/2016287433701138745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>Here is what you need to know about the schedule.</p>\n                <p>Favorable nonconference slate</p>\n                <p>Penn State starts the season once again with a trio of nonconference opponents. All three of the games will be played in Pennsylvania, with two of them being at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>Those opponents will be Marshall, Temple and Buffalo. When the Nittany Lions face the Thundering Herd and the Bulls, it\u2019ll be in State College. In Week 2, they\u2019ll travel to Lincoln Financial Field, also the home of the Philadelphia Eagles, to play the Owls.</p>\n                <p>In 2025, all three squads boasted a 5-7 record, making Penn State likely a way-too-early favorite by a comfortable margin in every matchup.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will see familiar faces when they face Temple, as quarterback Jaxon Smolik, tight end Joey Schlaffer, safety Kolin Dinkins and defensive tackle Kaleb Artis all transferred to the Owls following the 2025 season.</p>\n                <p>The idea of facing lower-level FBS and FCS programs for Power Four conferences will likely be a trend for the foreseeable future, as schools will want to minimize losses in pursuit of a College Football Playoff appearance.</p>\n                <p>Toughest stretch</p>\n                <p>Weeks 6 and 7 will be the toughest stretch of games for the Nittany Lions, hosting USC and traveling to Michigan in consecutive weeks.</p>\n                <p>During the 2025-26 campaign, both sides boasted a 9-4 record, finishing right next to each other in the final AP Poll of the year, as the Trojans were No. 20 and the Wolverines were No. 21. Both teams lost in the postseason, as USC fell to TCU in the Alamo Bowl while Michigan dropped the Citrus Bowl to Texas.</p>\n                <p>Both teams bring back their star quarterbacks, with USC returning Jayden Maiva and Michigan bringing back Bryce Underwood. There also are some changes, as the Trojans lost defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn to Penn State for the same role while the Wolverines replaced head coach Sherrone Moore with Kyle Whittingham from Utah.</p>\n                <p>The game\u2019s on Oct. 10, so there\u2019s a good chance the USC game is the White Out with it being at the midway point of the season and the Trojans being the best opponent up to that point. On the other hand, a road game at Michigan Stadium is a daunting environment, as the atmosphere \u201cthe Big House\u201d creates is up there for one of the best in college football.</p>\n                <p>Overall</p>\n                <p>On paper, Penn State has a pretty easy schedule, but as the 2025 season indicated, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be a breeze.</p>\n                <p>The expectation this past season was the only regular season losses for the Nittany Lions could\u2019ve been Oregon and Ohio State. Instead, it resulted in a six-loss, spiraling season.</p>\n                <p>With that being said, the only matchups that present a notable challenge on paper in 2026 are USC and Michigan.</p>\n                <p>An argument can be made for Washington as well, as Penn State will make the cross-country trip to face the Huskies for the first time on the road since they joined the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Still, the makeup of the roster shows this, as of January, is a team that should be able to win football games. With no Indiana, Ohio State or Oregon on the schedule, and Purdue, Rutgers and Maryland on it, the slate gives Campbell an opportunity to cash in on an easier schedule in Year 1 at the helm.</p>\n                <p>With that being said, the talent on the roster has to gel together for the schedule to work out in Penn State\u2019s favor. The makeup of the roster is those coming transferring in from 8-4 Iowa State, players who stuck around from a 7-6 Penn State and an assortment of recruits and other transfers.</p>\n                <p>If the roster can find its chemistry come August, the 2026 group of games should have Campbell leading the Nittany Lions to a winning record in comfortable fashion next year.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State opens up its 2026 campaign with a loaded nonconference schedule that lasts over a span of 26 games before it faces its first Big Ten opponent. Last season, the Nittany Lions finished 25-27 and 10-12 in nonconference play.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white dug itself into an early hole in its 2025 campaign, recording just one win in five nonconference games at the NFCA Leadoff Classic. Blue and white head coach Clarisa Crowell\u2019s squad looks to come out hot this season and pick up key wins before conference play begins on March 13 against Oregon.</p>\n                <p>NFCA Leadoff Classic</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions travel to Clearwater, Florida, for a slate of games against Missouri, Boston College, Eastern Kentucky, BYU and Auburn.</p>\n                <p>The season kicks off against Missouri on Feb. 6, and while the Tigers finished last in the SEC in 2025, they could still be a tough opponent to begin the new campaign. Despite Penn State having the highest ERA in the Big Ten in 2025 at 5.76, the Tigers struggle behind the plate.</p>\n                <p>Missouri finished last in its conference in many major offensive categories, including batting average, runs, hits and RBIs. Additionally, junior Bridget Nemeth returns to the pitching staff after an injury ended her season, after she faced just four batters.</p>\n                <p>With just one returner from last year\u2019s rotation, sophomore Abigail Britton, it\u2019s important for this new pitching staff to come out hot against a rocky offensive team.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions then take on Boston College and Eastern Kentucky. The blue and white should be favored in both of these matchups, but the Colonels could be difficult. They finished with a 38-16 record last season and are an ASUN powerhouse.</p>\n                <p>The key to a victory over Eastern Kentucky is shutting down star junior Kennedy Drafton. The Pearland, Texas, native had an excellent 2025 campaign, posting a .356 average with 52 hits and 45 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>Following that matchup, Penn State takes on a good BYU squad. The Cougars were on the cusp of reaching the NCAA Tournament, but fell just short after a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, BYU finished 32-17 and was one of the best offensive teams in the conference with the third-best batting average at .308.</p>\n                <p>The opening slate of games wraps up against Auburn, which finished hot after a rocky start to last season. The Tigers made it all the way to the NCAA regionals before falling to Florida State.</p>\n                <p>Houston/HCU Invitational</p>\n                <p>Penn State hits the road again to Houston, Texas, for games against Incarnate Word, Houston, Lafayette, Houston Christian and Pitt. This is a favorable part of the schedule for the Nittany Lions as they should have the upper hand in all the contests.</p>\n                <p>Houston finished last in the Big 12 in 2025 at 22-25 and was bounced in the first round of its conference tournament against BYU. However, the squad has new leadership after the Cougars fired its coach, Kristin Vesely, after nine seasons.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white conclude the invitational against interstate rival Pitt. The Panthers finished at 20-32 in 2025, but one of the bright spots of their rough campaign was a 16-8 win over the Nittany Lions in Happy Valley. Penn State needs to limit Pitt\u2019s offense in its matchup for a chance at redemption.</p>\n                <p>SPACEU Classic</p>\n                <p>The next group of games takes the Nittany Lions to Orlando, Florida, for games against Charleston Southern, UCF, Ohio and Notre Dame.</p>\n                <p>Penn State should hold steady against most of these squads, but UCF will be a true test. The Knights finished as one of the top teams after reaching the NCAA Regional Final.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s bats will be challenged by UCF\u2019s dominant pitching staff, who finished with the fourth-best ERA in the Big 12 in 2025 at 3.07. Sophomore Isabelle Vega had a breakout freshman campaign, with an excellent 1.70 ERA and 110 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Tennessee Invitational</p>\n                <p>February concludes with matchups against NC Central, Tennessee and Appalachian State in Knoxville, Tennessee. Two games against the talented Volunteers highlight this round of games.</p>\n                <p>Tennessee finished as a top-eight team in the nation after plowing through multiple tough opponents and reaching the Women\u2019s College World Series semifinals, where it lost to SEC foe Texas. The Volunteers are a complete team, and it showed with their 47-17 record and dominance on both sides of the field.</p>\n                <p>If Penn State pulls off the upset, then it will earn much praise from the softball world and put the program on notice.</p>\n                <p>Penn State Softball Invitational</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions head back to Happy Valley for their opening home slate against Lehigh, Binghamton, Colgate and Niagara. This should be a successful series of games for Penn State, as they are favored in all matchups.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have won against Lehigh in its last two games against the Bald Eagles, so its home opener should likely end in a victory.</p>\n                <p>Oregon State</p>\n                <p>Penn State travels cross-country and ends its early nonconference play at Oregon State on March 11. The Beavers finished at 24-23 in the West Coast last season and boast a 4-0 record against the Nittany Lions this millennium.</p>\n                <p>The last matchup between the two teams was in 2014 when Oregon State defeated Penn State 12-10 in a neutral site.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have two more nonconference games, Bucknell and Saint Francis, later in the season, but both matchups are winnable.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s essential for Crowell\u2019s squad to pull off some upsets and win the favorable matchups before entering play in a tough conference.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>With the 2026 season days away, Penn State\u2019s roster has been finalized and is ready to be put to the test this year. With returning stars, impacting transfers and freshmen ready to step back onto the dirt and have a long run into the spring.</p>\n                <p>As veteran leadership returns to Beard Field, guidance from the upperclassmen is key.</p>\n                <p>Here are some players to watch as the 2026 season looms.</p>\n                <p>Brooke Klosowicz</p>\n                <p>Brooke Klosowicz is returning to the blue and white after an astounding 2025 season. She led the Nittany Lions in every offensive stat, starting and appearing in all 52 games last year.</p>\n                <p>With her .422 batting average, she led Penn State with 65 hits, 23 doubles and a tied best 13 home runs. Klosowicz has been named a preseason top-10 utility player by D1Softball. She\u2019s looking to build off her record-breaking sophomore season.</p>\n                <p>Natalie Lieto</p>\n                <p>The true freshman from last season returns for the Nittany Lions, Natalie Lieto. The Monroe, Connecticut native is expected to excel in her sophomore year for the blue and white. With her speed, power and defensive skill in the outfield.</p>\n                <p>Lieto was named to the Big Ten All-Defensive team as one of two student-athletes in the league who were true freshmen. Penn State\u2019s defensive MVP in the postseason after tallying 98 outputs. Left fielder had an impressive .329 batting average with a .936 OPS over the course of her first season with the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>McKenna Young</p>\n                <p>Transfer from South Dakota, McKenna Young joins the Nittany Lions pitching staff for her junior year. In her breakout season as a Coyote, she went 14-8 in the circle. Finishing the season with 152 strikeouts, 10 complete games and five shutouts in her 2025 season.</p>\n                <p>With Young in the circle for Penn State, the defensive side for the Nittany Lions looks promising for the upcoming season.</p>\n                <p>Gabby Grandishar</p>\n                <p>Champion, Ohio native Gabby Grandishar was one of the most versatile two-way players in the 2025 signing class.</p>\n                <p>Being a pitcher and infielder with the height of 5-foot- 9, Grandishar is a high prospect with a lot of potential and versatility. On the plate but also in the diamond.</p>\n                <p>Coming into Happy Valley as the No.54 prospect in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Breanna Hanik</p>\n                <p>Another standout recruit in the 2025 class was Breanna Hanik, who joined the blue and white. Ranked No. 65 in the nation for overall player. The Oak Lawn, Illinois native led Marist High School to the state championship game in three seasons.</p>\n                <p>Having a combination of defense, power, and speed contributes depth to the lineup. Adding excitement to the squad as well as youth. Penn State will rely heavily on Hanik for her positioning in the outfield, as she\u2019s expected to see early action there.</p>\n                <p>The 2026 season is days away, and their lineup is an important first step into a successful season. Taken together, these players form a top-tier lineup that will succeed in the regular season and postseason.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s hockey plans on fully transforming Happy Valley into Hockey Valley this weekend with arguably the most widely anticipated regular season series in program history, as the No. 2 Michigan State Spartans travel to State College Friday and Saturday.</p>\n                <p>All eyes on the outside</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s contest will take place inside of Beaver Stadium, the first men\u2019s hockey game to take place in the historic football venue. The gravitas of the event has drawn the eyes of the national media to this top-five matchup with attention that regular-season college hockey doesn\u2019t usually receive.</p>\n                <p>Reporters who typically focus on the National Hockey League, including Barstool\u2019s Paul Bissonette, are gathering around the game as a prototype for an NHL Winter Classic taking place in Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has played in just one outdoor game up to this point, coming last season at Wrigley Field\u2019s Frozen Confines, where it tied Notre Dame and lost the shootout. Michigan State has played in multiple outdoor games during its history, including the Frozen Confines. The Spartans are 2-2-2 all time in outdoor games.</p>\n                <p>Temperatures for the game are expected to feature a wind chill well below zero degrees Fahrenheit. Both benches will be heated to keep players warm while off the ice. Fans attending the game can enjoy \u201cwarming zones\u201d around the east side of Penn State\u2019s campus, as well as hot beverages sold inside Beaver Stadium to combat the frigid temperatures.</p>\n                <p>While Saturday\u2019s game is expecting over 60,000 fans in attendance, Friday\u2019s game should push for the all-time attendance record at Pegula Ice Arena. With fans coming to town early, the smaller venue has a get-in price of over $50 for standing room only tickets as of Thursday morning.</p>\n                <p>The hype centers around the star power on display as well as the scenery, with Gavin McKenna, Jackson Smith and Aiden Fink going up against Porter Martone, Cayden Lindstrom and Trey Augustine. These top prospects will be the focus of the national media throughout this top-five series.</p>\n                <p>Battle scars</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions traveled to East Lansing in early November and suffered two losses at the hands of the green-and-white. The first game was a closely contested overtime loss, but game two was an embarrassing disaster for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white lost 5-0 in an embarrassing loss that was highlighted by multiple line brawls and egregious penalties. The game marked Josh Fleming\u2019s worst game of the season and saw the offense unable to compete against a Michigan State defense that was overpowering.</p>\n                <p>Since that game, Penn State made a focus to find an identity and to control its emotions on the ice. Both of those plans have come to fruition in the second half, as Penn State is in the midst of a seven-game winning streak. Stars like McKenna and Fink have started showing the offensive prowess they were hyped upon when they arrived to begin the campaign. The trajectory is similar to last year\u2019s Nittany Lions, with more success for the groundwork than the nearly winless stretch Happy Valley witnessed in 2024.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State has been at the top of the nation throughout the year, led by Martone and Augustine. Martone, the Flyers' most recent first-round pick, sits at 28 points on the year, while Augustine holds a 1.73 goal-against-average and a .938 save percentage.</p>\n                <p>Series History</p>\n                <p>Historically, the Spartans are the Nittany Lions\u2019 closest rival. The series sits at 22-22-8 entering this weekend. The visitors hold the recent advantage, leading the series 8-2-4 since 2022, including a 4-0-1 mark in the last five matchups at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Ben Schoen\u2019s eight points pace every current Nittany Lion in points against Michigan State, while Aiden Fink leads with five goals. Fink missed November\u2019s series due to injury.</p>\n                <p>The series renews at 6 p.m. Friday at Pegula Ice Arena and 1 p.m. Saturday at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | Who\u2019ll step up in net for No. 7 Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse with goalie Jack Fracyon graduated?",
    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State goaltender Jack Fracyon started between the pipes for three years, and when a mainstay netminder graduates, it can be difficult to fill the gap left behind. The Nittany Lions are in one such situation.</p>\n                <p>Coach Jeff Tambroni has four options for who\u2019ll step into the starting role: senior Will Mitchell, junior Ben Johnson, redshirt freshman Hayes Schreiner and true freshman Preston Hawkins.</p>\n                <p>1. Ben Johnson</p>\n                <p>Johnson, a junior out of Peoria, Illinois, was the only backup goaltender to appear in action last year, with Fracyon playing nearly the entire season. He entered the crease on two separate occasions, playing the closing minutes in a pair of games.</p>\n                <p>His first outing was against Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, where he didn\u2019t face a shot in his little time in between the pipes. In his second game against Robert Morris, where he made three saves on five shots in the fourth quarter, Penn State won 22-8.</p>\n                <p>Johnson played in three games as a freshman, making two saves on four shots in that season. After seeing no shots against Navy, Johnson saw two shots against Cornell and Maryland each, where he made one save in both games. His appearance against the Terrapins, leading to a 19-9 victory, was also his first and only postseason experience, as it was the Big Ten semifinals.</p>\n                <p>Having experience at the collegiate level is valuable when having to choose the next starter. Johnson, being the only one with that experience, appears to be a shoo-in to fill Fracyon\u2019s role to start the season.</p>\n                <p>2. Hayes Schreiner</p>\n                <p>Schreiner is my second choice for who I believe would inherit Fracyon\u2019s crease. While he\u2019s yet to make his debut at the collegiate level, the Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, native\u2019s bright future can be summed up by his high school resume and his family\u2019s prestige.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt freshman was a four-star recruit via Inside Lacrosse, having played all four years of his high school lacrosse career on the Chestnut Hill Academy varsity team and being named the captain in his senior season. There, he set the all-time school record for most saves in a career.</p>\n                <p>Schreiner\u2019s noteworthy performance earned him various honors in 2023, including being named to the All-State, All-Philly and All-Inter-Academic teams.</p>\n                <p>Looking deeper into his history with the sport, it\u2019s apparent that Schreiner comes from a \u201clacrosse family.\u201d His father, Todd, a graduate of Lehigh and also a goalie, was drafted in the seventh round by the Rochester Rattlers in the 2002 Major Lacrosse League (MLL) draft. Hayes\u2019 mother, Katie, played lacrosse at Washington College.</p>\n                <p>Should Tambroni place his trust in the young netminder, and Schreiner perform aptly, he\u2019ll presumably have a long-term goalie on his hands. Someone who\u2019s able to produce for three or four years in a row, like Fracyon.</p>\n                <p>And in lacrosse, stability between the pipes can\u2019t be ignored.</p>\n                <p>3. Preston Hawkins</p>\n                <p>Hawkins, while being the youngest of the four, is far from out of the running. It\u2019s rather uncommon for true freshmen to receive playing time due to a lack of collegiate experience or simply because of how the older netminders fit into the current system.</p>\n                <p>However, Hawkins\u2019 background suggests that he\u2019ll be ready to compete with Johnson and Schreiner for the starting role.</p>\n                <p>Hawkins, a Powell, Ohio, native, was rated a four-star recruit by Inside Lacrosse as well as the 96th best goaltender in the Class of 2025. He committed to Penn State back in 2023 and remained loyal.</p>\n                <p>Like Schreiner, Hawkins also holds his high school\u2019s record for most career saves, and he did so in his junior year at Worthington Kilbourne High School.</p>\n                <p>His long list of high school awards includes a trio of consecutive conference championships, back-to-back First-Team All-State honors, being named a USA Lacrosse All-American, and the Ohio Goalie of the Year award.</p>\n                <p>It may be worth testing Hawkins in goal against an unranked opponent, or playing him in the fourth quarter of a blowout, to see where his baseline collegiate capabilities are before his maturity rises over the course of his career.</p>\n                <p>4. Will Mitchell</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s Mitchell\u2019s senior season, and the Matthews, North Carolina, native hasn\u2019t touched the field throughout his collegiate career, serving as a depth piece behind Fracyon.</p>\n                <p>Despite not seeing action so far at Penn State, Mitchell\u2019s veteran wisdom brings a new skill set: mentoring.</p>\n                <p>Being the oldest of the goalies, someone who\u2019s \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d in terms of the daily life of a student athlete, he\u2019s able to provide the younger goalies like Schreiner and Hawkins, as well as other incoming recruits, with knowledge.</p>\n                <p>However, it\u2019s hard to argue against seniority being at play when it comes down to the \u201cgarbage minutes\u201d at the end of a blowout victory or defeat. Tambroni may elect to throw Mitchell a bone and give him the time in goal that he\u2019s dreamt of for the past three years over someone like Schreiner or Hawkins, who\u2019ll have more opportunities as they grow older.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Staff predictions | How does Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse shape up against the gauntlet of schedule?",
    "author": "The Daily Collegian Men's Lacrosse Staff",
    "description": "<p>After narrowly falling to Cornell in the 2025 NCAA semifinals, Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse enters 2026 with a reloaded roster and renewed opportunity to make a deep postseason run.</p>\n                <p>Although it won\u2019t be an easy path for the Nittany Lions, as they\u2019re presented with a difficult stretch of both Big Ten and nonconference ranked foes. One question looms: how do they stack up entering this stretch?</p>\n                <p>AJ Piazza: 9-3</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s coming off a Final Four run and could potentially make its third run in four years if things go right this season. I believe Penn State will start off its season hot with wins against Colgate and Villanova, but then take a loss to No. 2 Princeton on the road.</p>\n                <p>I think the Nittany Lions will bounce back against Navy and Yale, continue to build momentum, and defeat big opponents in No. 4 Cornell and No. 6 North Carolina before the squad enters Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>As the blue and white enter the Big Ten play, I believe it will lose to No. 1 Maryland as its last loss of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>I think Penn State will end the year on a four-game win streak: No. 10 Ohio State, No. 15 Johns Hopkins, No. 20 Michigan and No. 18 Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>Andrew Mercer: 9-3</p>\n                <p>I wholeheartedly believe that Penn State will win the games against unranked opponents, Colgate, Villanova, Navy and Yale. The Nittany Lions aren\u2019t in a position to fall in upset defeats, as every game counts that much more when you\u2019re proving that the Final Four run wasn\u2019t just a fluke.</p>\n                <p>I think that the Nittany Lions\u2019 only conference loss will be to No. 1 Maryland. The Terrapins are a tough team every year and historically have Penn State\u2019s number. Last season, Maryland took down the Nittany Lions twice, once in the regular season and then in the Big Ten semifinals.</p>\n                <p>I also have Penn State losing to No. 4 Cornell and No. 2 Princeton. The Big Red were the ones to defeat the Nittany Lions in the National Semifinals last year; history is on Cornell\u2019s side. Secondly, the Big Red are the defending national champions, and it\u2019s hard to argue against the hardware that coach Connor Buczek and company have earned.</p>\n                <p>As for the Tigers, Penn State and Princeton met once last season inside Holuba Hall. It was a different environment, yes, with weather being a non-factor and the Tigers ended up defeating the blue and white in overtime.</p>\n                <p>The rest I have noted down in my \u201cwin column.\u201d I have to admit, No. 6 North Carolina and the defending Big Ten champions, No. 10 Ohio State, will be tough games, but I believe that Penn State has the tools to emerge with both victories.</p>\n                <p>Elliott Inscho: 8-4</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions should start the season off strong with wins over Colgate and Villanova, two teams that they defeated handily last season. The first bump in the road for the blue and white will be against No. 2 Princeton. However, I think they\u2019ll fail to avenge last season\u2019s overtime loss to the Tigers.</p>\n                <p>Navy and Yale should also be relatively easy wins for Penn State, putting them at 4-1 when reigning national champion No. 4 Cornell comes into Happy Valley on March 7.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions split their outings with the Big Red in 2025, winning in the regular season but losing the more notable NCAA semifinal. I think the pattern continues in 2026, and Penn State gets a big-time win over Cornell to bring their record to 5-1.</p>\n                <p>I think they\u2019ll then lose two straight games, to No. 6 North Carolina and No. 1 Maryland, but get back on track in a rivalry matchup with No. 10 Ohio State in Columbus.</p>\n                <p>While, to this point, I've only seen the Nittany Lions lose to higher-ranked teams, I think they\u2019re bound to be upset at least once. I see them losing one of the last three to either No. 15 Johns Hopkins, No. 20 Michigan or No. 18 Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>At 8-4 overall and 3-2 in Big Ten play, it won\u2019t be the strongest season in recent memory, but the blue and white will be in a solid position to make noise in the postseason.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 14 Penn State has a chance to put a stop to its two-game losing streak this weekend, as it prepares to face No. 3 Hawai\u2019i.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will come back to Rec Hall this weekend to face Hawai\u2019i at 6 p.m. Friday for the White Out match and 5 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white enter this contest after a tough weekend against then-No. 15 McKendree, where it was swept, resulting in its first two losses of the 2026 season.</p>\n                <p>After previously sitting at No. 10, the Nittany Lions have shifted down four places this week as they prepare for their next ranked matchup.</p>\n                <p>With Hawai\u2019i at 7-1 thus far, and being only the third-ranked opponent for the blue and white this season, it will be a tougher match.</p>\n                <p>Hawai\u2019i has had a strong start to the year, suffering only one loss to Loyola Chicago earlier this season. It has remained within the top 3 in every AVCA Poll since the season began, and it hasn\u2019t lost a match since Jan. 9.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white haven\u2019t had the best of luck against the Rainbow Warriors. Last season, Penn State lost both matches against Hawai\u2019i, including a season-ending loss in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>While Hawai\u2019i comes into this contest hot and with the odds in its favor, it will be the first road trip of the year for the squad, heading to the Commonwealth with a clash against Robert Morris first.</p>\n                <p>Despite the two losses Penn State took this weekend, it hasn\u2019t been all bad.</p>\n                <p>Sean Harvey has been a key piece to the blue and white\u2019s squad so far this year. With 71 kills on the season, the redshirt sophomore ranks No. 32 in the NCAA in kills per set and is second on the Penn State squad in the same category.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s not the only standout, though.</p>\n                <p>Ryan Merk ranks No. 11 in the NCAA in digs this week, with 52 on the year. The libero was also named EIVA Defensive Player of the Week ahead of the matchup, making him a huge threat on the court.</p>\n                <p>However, there are some notable struggles. Serving seems to be a challenge for the Nittany Lions, especially when compared to the opposition.</p>\n                <p>Hawai\u2019i\u2019s Justin Todd has 11 service aces on the year, leading the Rainbow Warriors and ranking No. 32 in the NCAA in aces per set. As a team, Hawai\u2019i is currently ranked No. 16 in the same category.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s Owen Rose has eight service aces on the year to lead the Nittany Lions, but doesn\u2019t currently rank in the top 50 in the NCAA in aces per set. When compared to Hawai\u2019i\u2019s ranking in that category, the blue and white squad trails far behind, tied at No. 29.</p>\n                <p>The Hawai\u2019i defense also looks solid. In fact, 6-foot-11 setter Tread Rosenthal currently leads the Rainbow Warriors with 21 blocks, ranking him 31st in the NCAA in blocks per set.</p>\n                <p>But Penn State has some stars of its own.</p>\n                <p>Gaige Gabriel has 20 blocks so far, and currently sits tied at 44th in the NCAA in blocks per set. Again, Rose leads the Nittany Lions with 23 blocks, ranking him 26th in the NCAA in blocks per set, five places above Rosenthal.</p>\n                <p>It does seem that Hawai\u2019i has the better odds. All time, the Rainbow Warriors are 19-10 against the Nittany Lions. While they\u2019ve only played in University Park once before, Hawai\u2019i won that match.</p>\n                <p>Both teams have a lot to play for this weekend, as Hawai\u2019i looks to keep its winning streak alive, and the Nittany Lions look to pick their streak back up in the ranked matchup.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>This weekend, No. 4 Penn State will play a major role in the first-ever \u201cWinter Sports Weekend\u201d in historic fashion when it hosts the first-ever outdoor game in Penn State history. The Nittany Lions will host the Robert Morris Colonials.</p>\n                <p>Game 1 of the series will be at 1 p.m. on Friday at Beaver Stadium, with Game 2 at 6 p.m. on Saturday at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>This will be the second matchup of the season between these two teams after they first met on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 of 2025. Penn State took both games with a 4-0 score as goaltender Katie DeSa recorded back-to-back shutouts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is 16-24-8 all time against Robert Morris and has won the last six games played between the two.</p>\n                <p>Recent records</p>\n                <p>The blue and white will walk through the gates of Beaver Stadium on the heels of a five-game win streak and are 7-2-1 in its last 10 games. The Nittany Lions currently sit atop the AHA standings with a 17-1 record, giving them 52 points.</p>\n                <p>As for the Colonials, they have dropped each of their last four contests and are 5-5 in their last 10 games. With a 6-10-2 conference record, they sit sixth in the standings with 21 points on the year.</p>\n                <p>Scoring centers</p>\n                <p>Centering the top line for the red, white and blue is Jessica MacKinnon, the team\u2019s top scorer. In 28 games, MacKinnon has recorded 13 goals and 16 assists for 29 points. Her goal and point totals rank her fifth in the conference in both categories.</p>\n                <p>In the faceoff circle, MacKinnon has the most wins in the conference with 375 and a faceoff win-rate of 61.5%, the third most in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Who she\u2019ll face up against is still to be determined, with Penn State\u2019s first-line center position needing to be filled with the absence of captain Tessa Janecke, who has begun her preparations for the Winter Olympics.</p>\n                <p>One likely candidate to fill that position is winger Grace Outwater. Next to Janecke, Outwater is the team's second-highest scorer. She is second in the conference to Janecke in goals with 18, and third in points with 30.</p>\n                <p>Another option for coach Jeff Kampersal is McKenna Walsh. The freshman forward went 8-for-11 in the faceoff circle in the series against Delaware.</p>\n                <p>Rookie energy</p>\n                <p>This series also brings a matchup between a top group of rookies.</p>\n                <p>Playing on a line with Outwater and Maddy Christian is freshman Mikah Keller. With a goal and two assists in two games against Delaware, Keller tied for the most freshman points over the weekend, earning her honors as the AHA Rookie of the Week.</p>\n                <p>On the year, Keller has seven goals and 18 assists for 25 points, with five points in her last four games.</p>\n                <p>Manning the blue line for the Colonials is Linnea Misner, a freshman from Springfield, Manitoba.</p>\n                <p>A two-time AHA Rookie of the Week this season, Misner has put up four goals and 13 assists in 28 games. Her 17 points are the fourth-most among the team and the most for a defenseman.</p>\n                <p>Goaltending probables</p>\n                <p>After recording a new Penn State record 21 shutouts, DeSa will most likely get the nod for the blue and white in Friday\u2019s outdoor game. This season, the Pawcatuck, Connecticut, native is 18-2 with a conference-best .933 save percentage and a 1.26 goals-against-average, the third lowest in the nation.</p>\n                <p>With DeSa making just two starts since leaving with an injury during a Jan. 2 game against Ohio State, it is possible Kampersal could still ease her back into consistent play.</p>\n                <p>This would mean a potential start by Maddy Campbell, who set a women\u2019s hockey program record with her fourth shutout of the season, the most by a freshman goaltender. She is 6-2 with a .935 save percentage and a 1.44 goals-against-average.</p>\n                <p>Across the ice from DeSa, it is expected that Maggie Hatch will be between the pipes for Robert Morris. She made her most recent start last Friday against Mercyhurst and surrendered five goals in roughly 50 minutes before being pulled for redshirt sophomore Lucy Phillips.</p>\n                <p>Hatch is 8-10-2 with a .927 save percentage, 2.24 goals-against-average and five shutouts this season.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you're worrying about whether or not your resum\u00e9 is going to get you that dream internship, or you're stuck staring silently at the blank page in front of you, hoping words will magically appear for the essay you have due next week, the Writing Center @ Penn State Learning is here to help.</p>\n                <p>Located in both Boucke 220 and W102 Pattee, the tutors at the Writing Center are prepared to support you in any of your writing endeavors. The Writing Center offers drop-ins and appointment hours with sign-ups on Starfish and is free to all Penn State undergraduate students at the University Park campus.</p>\n                <p>Although it can be nerve-racking to have your writing read over by another student, the center is a judgment-free zone, and the tutors encourage anyone who needs help to check it out.</p>\n                <p>Kennedy Jones, a peer writing tutor, endorses this sentiment and wants anyone who comes into the center to feel welcome. In order to make all students feel comfortable, she eases them into the process by asking them about how their day is going or topics they\u2019re interested in.</p>\n                <p>\"It gives me more time to know them on a personal level before we start reading,\" Jones, a third-year studying journalism said.</p>\n                <p>According to Jones, she assists students with various essays from English 15: Rhetoric and Composition to projects in higher-level classes with the goal of guiding them to better, more structured pieces.</p>\n                <p>Jones said she learned about the program from her own English 15 professor, gave it a shot and ended up loving it.</p>\n                <p>\"It makes me happy to know that I can help students become more confident in their own writing and their own voice,\" Jones said.</p>\n                <p>To become a tutor, students have to enroll in a class \u2014 English 250: Peer Tutoring in Writing \u2014 where they learn how to become a tutor and revise writing effectively. The class also consists of a writing practicum with an experienced peer tutor mentor.</p>\n                <p>The process to join the class begins when students fill out an application to take the course, which is posted on the Penn State Learning website. After passing the class, students can be hired by the center.</p>\n                <p>Tabitha Fisher, the writing center coordinator, oversees the program and is the direct supervisor for all of the undergraduate peer writing tutors. She said the process is rigorous so the student tutors are equipped to help for many different academic writing needs.</p>\n                <p>\"We're here to facilitate conversations about writing and with writers to help them make independent decisions about the direction they want their writing to go,\" Fisher said. \"We work with writing in and outside of the classroom, so we work with a lot of upper-level writing courses as well, and things like resum\u00e9s, grad school applications, cover letters and personal writing.\"</p>\n                <p>Fisher said the center also hopes to serve the peer tutors themselves by providing an ethical employment model and prioritizing their professional development.</p>\n                <p>She also said the tutoring sessions work outside of the traditional model, with instead of having the tutor sit and read the work the writer brings in, the process is much more collaborative, centering the writer as the agent.</p>\n                <p>Usually, the process starts with the writer asking the tutor questions or looking at the assignment sheet together. Next, the tutor has the writer read their paper out loud, as a technique to help the writer catch things they may have missed in their first read through.</p>\n                <p>From there, the rest of the time focuses on the writer's objectives and what they specifically want to get done or are struggling with during the session, encouraging writers to understand that what they think is important to the tutors too.</p>\n                <p>Fisher said coming in for a tutoring session doesn't mean you struggle with writing \u2014 strong writers seek out assistance too.</p>\n                <p>\"This is a thing you do when you care a lot about your writing,\" Fisher said. \"Don't feel like you're stupid or a bad writer because you're thinking about seeking help.\"</p>\n                <p>Fisher is especially proud of the tutors in the program and said they are \"just so lovely.\"</p>\n                <p>\"I love getting the opportunity to work closely with them one-on-one and provide a good model for what a positive, constructive working environment looks like,\" Fisher said. \"I think that's my favorite part.\"</p>\n                <p>Julie Evanchak , a peer writing tutor, said one commonality she noticed among the students she tutors is a lack of confidence in their writing. Because of this, she said a lot of the time she focuses on instilling confidence in her writers, so they can be proud of their work.</p>\n                <p>\"I feel like there's this stigma behind tutoring, especially for students who don't know what it's like to be tutored,\" Evanchak, a second-year studying advertising/public relations, said. \"I like to make it personable and really collaborate together to make the writing better.\"</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Empty seats. Lost energy. No wins.</p>\n                <p>Penn State men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball have combined for zero wins and 19 losses in Big Ten play. At some point, the underperformance demands more than surface-level explanations.</p>\n                <p>The BJC.</p>\n                <p>While the Bryce Jordan Center isn\u2019t solely responsible for the struggles of Penn State\u2019s basketball programs, the elephant in the room has become difficult to ignore. The venue simply does not suit these programs.</p>\n                <p>For several years, the Nittany Lions and Lady Lions teams have looked like a sinking ship, seeking revitalization. Now, it appears that the ship has hit rock bottom. And the BJC is offering no mercy.</p>\n                <p>The Bryce Jordan Center came into existence with a groundbreaking $55 million cost funded through state and private dollars. On Jan 6, 1996, the arena officially opened, marking a new era in Penn State basketball history.</p>\n                <p>The arena was modeled after NBA venues and featured a total capacity of more than 15,000 seats. As one of the most modern arenas in college basketball, there was a lot to rejoice about in Happy Valley. Besides, the tides were turning.</p>\n                <p>In 1982, Penn State was rejected by the up-and-coming Big East, which voted 5-3 against welcoming the blue and white into its conference. But that very rejection turned out to be what Penn State needed.</p>\n                <p>Because, in 1990, Penn State ushered in a great advance in its athletics. The team accepted an invitation to join the Big Ten conference, leaving the Atlantic 10, to become its eleventh member. This marked a monumental shift in competitiveness as the Nittany Lions had previously sought out a better conference.</p>\n                <p>After all, Penn State had already cemented itself as a football school. In the midst of a widely successful Joe Paterno era, the Nittany Lions\u2019 football program was independent and actively sought to form conference ties with neighboring schools such as Pitt, Syracuse and West Virginia.</p>\n                <p>In hindsight, joining the Big East would\u2019ve surely done no good for a program that had visions of becoming a blue blood. Joining the Big Ten paid dividends in all aspects of Penn State athletics \u2014 more specifically, football.</p>\n                <p>But Penn State hoops was also on the rise, both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Under coach Jerry Dunn, the men\u2019s team plotted one of its most successful seasons prior to the BJC\u2019s opening. In the 1995-96 season, the blue and white posted a 21-7 record and made the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>The women\u2019s team, on the other hand, was beginning to turn into a perennial power. Under coach Rene Portland, the Lady Lions had endured their most successful tenure in program history. Penn State had made the NCAA Tournament in seven-straight seasons and charted seven-straight 20 or more win seasons. Success at its finest.</p>\n                <p>Then the moves were made. From the ornate Rec Hall to the state-of-the-art Bryce Jordan Center, Penn State hoops was in a new era. And, it hasn\u2019t quite shaped out.</p>\n                <p>Since the end of the Dunn era \u2014 which concluded in the early 2000s \u2014 Penn State men\u2019s basketball has only reached the NCAA Tournament twice. Additionally, the team has been ranked in the AP Poll just once.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 men\u2019s program endured five different coaches in this era, including Dunn. All of its seasons have featured double-digit loss totals, with a handful totaling as many as 20 losses.</p>\n                <p>All time, Penn State men\u2019s basketball is 1586-1285-1. Sitting at just above .500, the team is historically subpar. However, the Lady Lions are a different story. Only in recent years has Penn State women\u2019s basketball been that bad.</p>\n                <p>Historically, Penn State women\u2019s basketball has a 879-515 record, which marks a win percentage above .600. In its 45 seasons, the Lady Lions had just three coaches since 1981, including Portland, Coquese Washington and Carolyn Kieger who took over in 2019.</p>\n                <p>The recent woes have come at the grand expense of the Bryce Jordan Center. In the 2025 season, it got so bad that Penn State women\u2019s basketball moved back to Rec Hall to play the majority of its home games.</p>\n                <p>The tipping point came on Thursday, Jan. 22, when the Nittany Lions hosted Wisconsin in their annual game at Rec Hall. In what\u2019s normally a packed crowd at a maximum capacity that seats just over 6,500 people, the ancient arena was not nearly as full.</p>\n                <p>Penn State went on to lose 98-71 as the half-empty arena\u2019s lackluster energy failed to propel a closer game.</p>\n                <p>At this point, Penn State basketball has hit rock bottom. Both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams have become the laughing stock of the Big Ten. What might be playing a larger role in this catastrophe comes behind the scenes.</p>\n                <p>The Bryce Jordan Center is no longer a suitable basketball arena. These programs, unfortunately, require something less. In 2016, ESPN ranked the BJC 14th among the then-14 Big Ten conference schools in terms of the toughest places to play.</p>\n                <p>The article claimed Penn State\u2019s attendance fell just under 7,000 fans per game. That means the Nittany Lions weren\u2019t able to fill half the arena, back then, when the team was at least respectable. One can only wonder what that number looks like now.</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall opened back in 1928 and certainly is not the best of modern arenas. Since the Bryce Jordan Center\u2019s opening, Rec Hall has been used only for gymnastics, volleyball and wrestling.</p>\n                <p>Once the Lady Lions moved back, that marked one of two programs that should\u2019ve been added to the list. The other is Penn State men\u2019s basketball.</p>\n                <p>The Bryce Jordan Center is no longer equipped to house the sport of basketball in Happy Valley. While the venue is suitable, perhaps a change of scenery would benefit all parties involved.</p>\n                <p>Regardless, Penn State has proven it is not a basketball school, and playing in an area like that as if they were one is laughable.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>With Penn State\u2019s season nearing a start, the team has worked on building chemistry in coach Kayla Treanor\u2019s first year.</p>\n                <p>For the attackers, that synergy is already in place, with a majority of last year\u2019s attackers returning for another year. Here\u2019s a look at the Nittany Lions\u2019 current attacking room heading into this season.</p>\n                <p>Returners</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s attackers boast the strongest group of returners, having 10 athletes returning to Happy Valley this year.</p>\n                <p>Leading the charge is senior Erika Ho, who led the Nittany Lions with 46 goals last year. Despite graduating after her junior year, she returned for one more season with the blue and white and will look to be a difference maker in Treanor\u2019s offense.</p>\n                <p>Joining Ho near the top of last year\u2019s returners is Emma Kelly, who started in all but three games last year.</p>\n                <p>The Bethpage, New York, native recorded 20 goals in her junior year, a steady improvement from the year before.</p>\n                <p>After a successful freshman year where she scored 13 goals, attacker Ellie Wisch will seek her first career start as the third-highest-scoring returner from last year.</p>\n                <p>With a little more starting experience, junior Kelly MacKinney returns for Year 3 with 26 career starts. Despite only scoring 12 goals last year, MacKinney led the team in assists, recording 37 dishes for 49 points \u2014 the second-most on the squad.</p>\n                <p>Senior Payton Wainman enters this year as one of the more experienced returners.</p>\n                <p>Wainman played in 33 games in her career, starting 19 of them. The Delray Beach, Florida, native had a standout sophomore season with 12 goals and eight assists in 12 starts, but only scored eight goals with seven assists in her seven starts last year.</p>\n                <p>Delaney Radin stepped up and was a difference-maker for the Nittany Lions last season. After transferring from Florida, Radin scored three goals and two assists in her two starts.</p>\n                <p>After redshirting her freshman year, Minka Martinez made the most of her sole opportunity last year.</p>\n                <p>Martinez saw playing time in the team\u2019s 16-4 victory over Bucknell, where she recorded two assists.</p>\n                <p>Sophomores Porter Rhoades, Grace Tullock and redshirt sophomore Lainey Straub will all look for more playing time as well after appearing in just one contest each last season.</p>\n                <p>Freshmen</p>\n                <p>In a recruiting class of eight freshmen, the attacking group only has two new faces this year.</p>\n                <p>Lizzie Ann\u00e9 joins the Nittany Lions after leading her high school team to Utah Women's 5A State Championships in 2022 and 2024 with a 51-4 career record. Through three years, Ann\u00e9 recorded 98 goals and 53 assists.</p>\n                <p>Former Syracuse commit Rocquette Allen flipped to Penn State after Treanor\u2019s hiring, adding the team\u2019s second 4-star recruit alongside her sister defender Sarah Ann\u00e9.</p>\n                <p>Rocquette Allen fills out the class, ranked the No. 51 athlete in her class and helped lead her club team, Sky Walkers 2025 Blue, to a 20-5 record last year.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "\u2018He\u2019s a tough kid\u2019 | Cole Mirasola\u2019s \u2018mean\u2019 mentality showcases growth in debut season as starter",
    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>The heavyweight position is a spot that can range from around 200 pounds, all the way to 285 pounds. When deemed a smaller heavyweight, the wrestler has to utilize additional tactics other than size to succeed at the weight class.</p>\n                <p>For Cole Mirasola, he\u2019s focused on his quickness and IQ, while incorporating a mental aspect that has led him to a win streak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like in the past I haven\u2019t really been super mean when I wrestle, just kind of tactical and slick, but talking to coach Cael (Sanderson), you always have to be clean,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cYou can win dirty, like not being dirty, but pulling guys down and focusing on just being mean.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mirasola has implemented a mean aspect to his wrestling that\u2019s propelled him to the next level at the collegiate stage.</p>\n                <p>Entering this season, it was unknown how the redshirt freshman would fully perform. Being an undersized heavyweight, Mirasola showed what could happen against the bigger heavyweight during his redshirt season.</p>\n                <p>While Greg Kerkvliet was nursing an injury in 2025, Mirasola stepped in and faced Ohio State\u2019s Nick Feldman and Illinois\u2019 Luke Luffman. Both matches he was unable to get out from underneath the big wrestlers, proving that size does sometimes matter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s obviously a little bit smaller than the guys he\u2019s wrestling,\u201d Josh Barr said. \u201cBut, I think he just kind of got that chip on his shoulder to go out there and fight guys.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite facing bigger wrestlers, Mirasola has continued to maintain focus, perfecting his craft, but the mentality shifted as the season has gone along.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m trying to focus on being more mean, when I\u2019m wrestling, just kind of not like letting guys get any points easily,\u201d Mirasola said.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola\u2019s confidence in himself has never wavered. Through a two-match losing streak, questions arose from outside the program about the true potential of the heavyweight wrestler. Despite this, he continued to work and continued to believe in himself, becoming more bad-tempered with his approach in the process.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter where we wrestle,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be mean wherever we go.\u201d</p>\n                <p>This mean aspect has struck fear into his teammates, including Barr, who\u2019s attempting to \u201ctry and stay from him\u201d because \u201che\u2019s a mean, tough kid.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He showcased this mentality throughout his latest matches, using that anger to overpower some bigger wrestlers, while keeping steady in his attacks during bouts with wrestlers more of his size.</p>\n                <p>His first test of 2026 came against Iowa\u2019s Ben Kueter, who\u2019s closer to his weight than that of Lehigh\u2019s Nathan Taylor \u2014 who Mirasola lost to earlier in the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCole\u2019s continuing to obviously get better as he competes and his confidence,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola maintained his focus and upset Kueter, proving his capabilities despite this being his first collegiate season as the starter and one of the smaller heavyweights in the country.</p>\n                <p>The toughness and focus showed up in his most recent matchup against Maryland. Mirasola overpowered a heavier Joey Schneck and drove him to the ground multiple times before putting him in a cradle for the fall.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf I wrestle the whole time, I don\u2019t think anyone can really wrestle with me for that whole seven minutes,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cIf I use my conditioning as a factor, I think that\u2019ll help for sure.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mirasola\u2019s conditioning has pushed him to No. 12 in the InterMat rankings, winning his last seven matches entering the illustrious Bryce Jordan Center dual on Friday against Nebraska. With his first dual season still ongoing, the Jackson, Wisconsin, native is still \u201ckind of actively trying to get the extra calories.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The calorie growth has been a process for Mirasola who\u2019s slowly trying to add on. He\u2019s constantly putting the work in, and slowly adding weight to his already skilled body.</p>\n                <p>After succeeding in his first major test of 2026, Mirasola will face yet another highly ranked wrestler when the Cornhuskers come to town.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019ll take on a similar sized wrestler in AJ Ferrari, who\u2019s jumped weights after competing at 197 pounds last season. Ferrari\u2019s transition to heavyweight has seemingly been much easier, as he\u2019s matched up well against the heavier wrestlers. In his most recent match, he lost in sudden victory to Feldman, giving up just one takedown. His unique style will provide something a little different for the Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very tactical in the way he wrestles, so very tricky, and it\u2019ll be a fun challenge for Cole,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cObviously you got to wrestle wisely and do what you do to give yourself a chance of success there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019ll be a difficult task against Ferrari, who\u2019s showcased he\u2019s one of the best at heavyweight. Despite this, the weight matchup will favor Mirasola, who\u2019s thrived against wrestlers with a similar weigh-in.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a tough kid,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI\u2019m sure coach Cael mentioned that, but he\u2019s just going to get better every single match.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State kicked off an action-packed weekend of sports at Rec Hall for National Girls &amp; Women in Sports Day.</p>\n                <p>Amidst a 10-game losing streak, the struggles continued despite a strong performance against Minnesota as the Lady Lions fell to 7-15 with an 87-66 loss to the Golden Gophers.</p>\n                <p>After losing the tipoff, Penn State immediately went to defense, giving up a 3-pointer to Tori McKinney to get things started. However, freshman Tea Cleante fired back, tying things up with a 3-pointer of her own.</p>\n                <p>Despite her small height at 5-foot-6, Shaelyn Steele grabbed the Lady Lions\u2019 first defensive rebound of the game and took the ball back up the court for a fast-break jumper.</p>\n                <p>Up 8-5, neither team found any success during a two-minute cold stretch, but the Golden Gophers quickly took back the lead going into the media timeout.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions\u2019 successful start evaporated through the rest of the quarter as they couldn\u2019t get anything to fall, going nearly six minutes without any action while Minnesota went on a 10-0 run.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWith Gracie, we usually have our set package when we\u2019re in empties with her, and so we got to go to different options,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said. \u201cWe have to go to different pieces right now to find that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Golden Gophers opened the second quarter with just as much success, as McKinney drained another wide-open triple, followed by a pair of fouls by the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Down by double digits, Penn State attempted to get back in the game from the 3-point line. However, the Lady Lions were shooting just 3-for-11 from deep early on as Kiyomi McMiller and Nyla McFadden went 0-for-8.</p>\n                <p>Similar to the short-lived first quarter success, Penn State got hot midway through the second period, making five straight shots \u2014 four coming from deep.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought we played like a team (in the second quarter),\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI thought we shared the ball well and we were gritty on the defensive end.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McMiller\u2019s quiet start was quickly negated after back-to-back 3-pointers and a jump shot made it a six-point game. Things got even tighter, and even turned to a Lady Lion lead, after more 3-pointers from Cleante, Viktoria Ranisavljevic and Moriah Murray.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ultimately ended the quarter down by four points, but shrank its margin with six 3-pointers in Quarter 2.</p>\n                <p>Both teams battled to open the third quarter, as the Golden Gophers continued their success from deep with Maura Bran\u2019s second triple of the day.</p>\n                <p>Those 3-point battles continued well into the third period as senior Vitoria Santana cut Penn State\u2019s deficit to single digits before Minnesota\u2019s Brylee Glenn gave the Golden Gophers their biggest lead of the day at 12 points.</p>\n                <p>The two teams entered Wednesday\u2019s contest with the most and last turnovers in the Big Ten, with Penn State averaging 18.9 turnovers compared to Minnesota\u2019s 10.6. The results were a little closer when they faced off against each other, with the Lady Lions giving up just 11 turnovers while causing six against Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Another quarter, another 3-pointer as Grace Grocholski earned her spot on the stat sheet to give her team a 15-point lead.</p>\n                <p>Maggie Mendelson quickly found her first basket of the game after shaking a pair of opponents in the paint, followed by McMiller\u2019s 21st point of the day.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe play at our best when we\u2019re sharing the ball,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIn the second half, we didn\u2019t do a great job of getting good shots off and finding an open person.\u201d</p>\n                <p>However, the Golden Gophers continued to do what every Penn State opponent has done in the past month \u2014 extend the lead in the fourth quarter and hand the blue and white another loss.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota ultimately outscored the Lady Lions 10-5 down the final five minutes of action, dropping Penn State to 7-15 on the year and 0-11 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Injury report</p>\n                <p>Gracie Merkle hit the injury report for her second straight game after missing the final two minutes of last Wednesday\u2019s matchup against Washington. Meanwhile, forward Amiya Evans has been out since Jan. 11 despite Kieger hinting at a possible return Wednesday night.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions will have a much-needed break before traveling to Purdue next Wednesday to take on the Boilermakers at 7 p.m.</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will face Nebraska at the Bryce Jordan Center for its 20th matchup. Penn State has won the last nine matches against the Cornhuskers and could extend that to 10 as the favorites entering the dual.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a deep dive into the history of the matchups between Penn State and Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>Overall record</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a record of 11-8 against Nebraska. The Nittany Lions have been the better team as of late, while Nebraska won a lot of the early matchups. Penn State has not lost to the Cornhuskers since Cael Sanderson has been at the helm.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska head coach Mark Manning hasn\u2019t been able to get the Cornhuskers over the edge despite bringing in a lot of talent from the transfer portal like heavyweight AJ Ferrari on this year\u2019s roster. Manning will try to lead his team to an upset and its first victory against the Nittany Lions in a long time.</p>\n                <p>Notable all-time matches</p>\n                <p>Last season Penn State dominated Nebraska 31-7. No. 3 Tyler Kasak matched up against No. 5 Antrell Taylor, a matchup we will not see this season. Kasak exploded in the first period, and then it was pretty even until Kasak took over. He secured a takedown, and continued to be in control.</p>\n                <p>The now-junior secured four-near fall points as well to garner a large lead and get the victory, 9-3. Taylor went on later in the season to become a national champion.</p>\n                <p>One of the closest matchups between the two teams was in 2021-22. Penn State got the victory by a touchdown, 21-14. Former Nittany Lion and current assistant coach Nick Lee had a tight match against Chad Red Jr. Lee, who was No. 1 while Red Jr. was No. 8.</p>\n                <p>Lee seemed to be in control of the match despite the low scoring dual. Lee started off hot, but did allow Red Jr to get close, but once he did, Lee got behind him and was awarded two points to take the lead.</p>\n                <p>Lee also got an escape and was awarded an extra point for riding time to take the victory, 4-1. This match got the Nittany Lions the Big Ten regular season title.</p>\n                <p>In 2015-16, Penn State showed its dominance with a 24-10 win. Former wrestler turned UFC fighter Bo Nickal was a part of that dominance. Nickal was the No. 1 wrestler at 174 and wrestled No. 14 Micah Barnes. Nickal was the better wrestler.</p>\n                <p>The match was close for a majority of it. Barnes kept it to a 4-3 score until the later parts of the middle period. Nickal took over after the midway point, securing his third takedown of the match.</p>\n                <p>In the final period Barnes gave Nickal points by stalling. This allowed Nickal to extend his lead and get the decision win 10-3.</p>\n                <p>Last time Nebraska won</p>\n                <p>The last time Nebraska defeated Penn State was in 2008-09 when the Cornhuskers advanced to the NU National Duals semifinals when they defeated the Nittany Lions, 20-14.</p>\n                <p>This match was unique in how the results played out. Penn State won the first four duals, while Nebraska won the last six. At 157 pounds, No. 2 Jordan Burroughs got the first victory for the Cornhuskers and started the momentum for the squad. Burroughs got the 10-4 decision victory over No. 8 Dan Vallimont.</p>\n                <p>The largest victory of the match was at 197. No. 1 Craig Brester got the tech-fall win over Clay Steadman 20-5. The three-time All-American brought his team within reach to defeat Penn State and set up heavyweight Tucker Lane to put his team over the edge.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska had a stronger lineup than Penn State and it showed. Nebraska had eight-ranked wrestlers while Penn State only had two, which allowed the squad to get back in the match and get the victory. Lane sealed the deal with a 4-2 decision victory over Cameron Wade.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Freshman Kayden Mingo is known within Penn State to be mature beyond his years.</p>\n                <p>Mingo sat next to Mike Rhoades on the team bus following the Nittany Lions\u2019 84-78 loss to Ohio State on Monday, and the two broke down the game together. It\u2019s another example of the point guard always wanting to improve, even after shooting 22.2% from the field over the past two games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe takes great ownership in his play, good and bad,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cHe takes great ownership because he wants to get better. So, for a freshman point guard, this is eating at him, too, but he has a great mindset right now, just trying to get better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo made his return from a broken-nose injury in the last three matchups. After totaling 19 points and five assists on 58.3% shooting in his first game back against Maryland, he\u2019s scored just 10 points versus Wisconsin and Ohio State combined.</p>\n                <p>Particularly in the game against the Badgers, Mingo shot 3-of-14 from the field and 0-of-3 from 3-point range. He shot 1-of-4 on field goals versus the Buckeyes, and Rhoades cited opposing squads looking to contain one of Penn State\u2019s \u201cbiggest threats.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cTeams are doing that with Kayden,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI thought (Monday), them changing the defenses and all that stuff, he was more of a facilitator. Then he got going a little bit. He had eight assists. He had too many turnovers, but he had eight assists. He got guys shots. I thought he got into the interior of the zone, and even man to man, and got some guys shots.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo averaged two assists for every one turnover throughout Monday\u2019s game. Rhoades highlighted Mingo\u2019s assist to wing Eli Rice for a 3-pointer that kicked off a 27-10 run by the Nittany Lions to open the second half.</p>\n                <p>While playing in these past few games, Mingo wore a facemask due to his injury. After the Maryland game, he said he felt comfortable wearing the mask on the court.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere was an adjustment at the start,\u201d Mingo said Tuesday. \u201cNow, it's starting to get normal. It's definitely not the same as looking straight on without something in your face, but it's what we gotta do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to his injury, which caused him to miss three games, the 4-star prospect was a consistent scorer for Penn State, logging 12 games in double figures out of 14 opportunities. He\u2019s seen just one double-figure performance in his last three games, but with defenses keying in on him, his eight assists against Ohio State are the most he\u2019s had since tallying eight assists versus Michigan State on Dec. 13, which was a personal best.</p>\n                <p>Mingo is averaging 14.0 points, 3.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 2.1 steals per game through 17 appearances during Penn State\u2019s 9-11 start to this season. He\u2019s shooting 46.7% from the field and 23% from 3-point range, which is what Mingo said he wants to improve upon heading into the last 11 games of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's 20 games into his career, and we're all expecting so much of him because we need a lot from him,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cBut he's got to ride the wave, too. Some games, he's only gonna have six points and eight assists. Some games, he might get 16 points and four assists, but you got to continue to learn and get better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Usurping Penn State | How can collegiate wrestling catch up to Cael Sanderson\u2019s dynasty?",
    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Cael Sanderson\u2019s Nittany Lions have been the dominant program in the world of college wrestling for the better part of the last two decades. The program has won 12 of the last 14 national championships and are in the midst of the longest-winning streak in NCAA wrestling history.</p>\n                <p>Through changes in the landscape of college sports, no other team has been able to catch up to the dominance of the Nittany Lions. In fact, the current team may be in its best form yet, being the first team ever to have six wrestlers ranked No. 1 at the same time.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will also only lose one member of its starting lineup next year, will add top recruits and senior world champion Masanosuke Ono as well as returning past starters in Aaron Nagao and Tyler Kasak.</p>\n                <p>But dynasties can\u2019t last forever. In an upcoming era that sees the financial landscape of the entire NCAA changing and rules modernizing across the board, what will it take for another program to usurp Penn State as the top dogs in wrestling?</p>\n                <p>Big Ten Network analyst Shane Sparks watches more college wrestling than most of the country and has had a front row seat to see the Nittany Lions throughout this historic run. Despite having seen the entire national landscape of college wrestling, not even he could think of a solution for other programs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to close the gap, but it\u2019s another thing to actually beat (Penn State),\u201d Sparks told the Daily Collegian. \u201cHow does that happen? I don\u2019t have an answer for you.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Teams around the country are trying to innovate in order to reach levels near what is being accomplished inside the Lorenzo Wrestling Complex.</p>\n                <p>Oklahoma State decided to hire out of the Sanderson coaching tree, landing former Penn State wrestler and assistant coach David Taylor prior to last season. To build up his program faster, Taylor utilized the transfer portal heavily, including grabbing former Nittany Lions in Alex Facundo and Zack Ryder to insert into his starting lineup. While the new roster hasn\u2019t been as successful as hoped, Taylor had another trick up his sleeve.</p>\n                <p>The Cowboys landed a commitment from in-state Bishop McCort High School senior Jax Forrest last winter. He decided to enroll early and start competing this semester.</p>\n                <p>While Forrest hasn\u2019t reached his five-dates yet, after he secured a pin in the first minute of his debut, Forrest wrestled attached at the Cyclone Open, where he won the 133-pound weight class. The attachment signals that Forrest will burn his redshirt in order to compete at the NCAA tournament this season.</p>\n                <p>Others, including his former high school teammate and top 2027 recruit Melvin Miller have teased using the same tactic during their senior year.</p>\n                <p>Miller and his brother Bo Bassett are two central Pennsylvania natives from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. After two recruitment cycles, both prospects elected to spurn Penn State, first to commit to the Iowa Hawkeyes, then to Virginia Tech.</p>\n                <p>According to Bassett, Penn State was in the mix for both brothers throughout the recruitment process, even with Sanderson attempting to visit their home up until the day of their second commitment to the Hokies. However, Bassett had aspirations beyond joining college wrestling\u2019s most recent dynasty.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI have nothing but respect for what (Sanderson) is doing and this wasn\u2019t a decision I took lightly,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cIf I can add some trophies for Virginia Tech, that would be an amazing opportunity.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Recruits like Bassett and Miller, who have been in the national spotlight since they were children, chose the opportunity to be the faces of a program, rather than part of the machine in Happy Valley. Bassett has been an individual star since he began in the sport, even competing for Real American Freestyle as a high schooler.</p>\n                <p>Bassett\u2019s message for what it will take to rebuild a new dynasty is to not give any other programs too much respect and to hold belief in his coaches and teammates that they can outwork anybody.</p>\n                <p>For Miller, his mentality of what it means to be at the top of the sport guided his decision to follow Bassett to Virginia Tech.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been a guy that has to beat the best, and right now, Penn State is the best,\u201d Miller said. \u201cOur goal is to take a team to be top 10 up to the top one.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Virginia Tech has a plan to maximize the incoming talents, utilizing the redshirt on their 149 pound starter Caleb Henson after a season in which he went 30-2 en route to a national championship, to maximize their team points when Bassett arrives next year. Miller may follow in the spring similar to Forrest, but he admits the build will take time for the Hokies.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a couple of years of getting a full team and gaining consistency,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe just have to believe in ourselves and put in the hard work.\u201d</p>\n                <p>What has Penn State\u2019s response to these pushes by other programs? Essentially following the \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d motto. Sanderson\u2019s focus has been on building the program the way he has, focusing on recruiting wrestlers who prioritize becoming the best they can be over cashing in for the highest bidder.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a special thing going here and I think recruits see that,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cThis era has been good to us, so we\u2019re going to follow the rules and get the kids that want to come here for the right reasons.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Programs attempting to match Penn State are focusing on areas similar to what Sanderson pushed for the Nittany Lions in 2011, including acquiring a premium supporting staff and building wrestling clubs of top talent beside the college program.</p>\n                <p>They\u2019re also attempting to utilize the NIL era and outside desires of recruits to land the level of talent Sanderson has consistently developed.</p>\n                <p>But both recruits and analysts know that the gap is wide between Penn State and the rest of the wrestling landscape. Closing that gap will take a lot, especially with the Nittany Lions at the top of their game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf anyone is going to even match (Penn State), it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re losing anytime soon.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>After consecutive weekends of going 2-0, Penn State returns to the Bryce Jordan Center for the second time this season and the first time in the new calendar year.</p>\n                <p>The No. 1 Nittany Lions will face No. 6 Nebraska at 8 p.m. on Friday in a matchup between two of the premier teams in the country. Ahead of the dual, Cael Sanderson met with the media.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he had to say.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska</p>\n                <p>Despite the Cornhuskers being one of the better opponents that Penn State has seen this year, the mentality, as always, remains the same, as Sanderson said the mindset is \u201cthe same as every week.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it's pretty similar,\u201d Sanderson said of the mentality. \u201cFor me, the guys are trying to be the best they can be. So, I think it's exciting. I mean, it's a BJC dual, obviously, a very strong opponent. One where there\u2019s 10 good guys makes it fun.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson had praise for Nebraska head coach Mark Manning, who has been with the Cornhuskers for the last 26 seasons, clashing with Sanderson for the last 17 years.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson complimented Manning\u2019s passion, calling him a \u201cgreat competitor.\u201d He also highlighted his ability to churn out a consistently dominant program year in and year out.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEvery year they're really good, and they always have a really good dual-meet team,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Aaron Nagao</p>\n                <p>Last week, Sanderson confirmed that 141-pounder Aaron Nagao was out for the season following his injury at the Black Knight Invitational in November. He returned to the mat at the Southern Scuffle, winning his first match, but then medically forfeiting the next one.</p>\n                <p>His future is currently uncertain. Sanderson was unsure about the possibility of Nagao being able to obtain a medical redshirt, in which Sanderson replied with \u201cmaybe.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe would have one already, based on previous years, so I think that would be an option for him, if that\u2019s something we wanted to take,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said it\u2019ll be a \u201clong road to recovery\u201d for Nagao, who already had to make a similar form of a comeback, returning to the mat this season after having not wrestled for close to two years prior due to another injury.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to figure that out. Obviously, we would love to have him continue to wrestle,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe\u2019s also a guy who has exciting plans and he got married this past summer, and has a lot going on. So, a lot of good, positive things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke vs. Antrell Taylor</p>\n                <p>Up to this point of the year, Friday will bring the toughest matchup for No. 3 PJ Duke, as the freshman will face No. 5 Antrell Taylor, who won the NCAA Championship a season ago.</p>\n                <p>The top-five matchup will have lots of national attention when the pair squares off in the Bryce Jordan Center. It\u2019ll be the first time the tandem clashes on the collegiate stage, but not the first time ever.</p>\n                <p>Last May, when Duke was still a senior at Minisink Valley High School, he wrestled Taylor at the World Team Trials, beating him by a score of 8-6.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPJ is an incredible competitor, has an opportunity to wrestle a defending national champion in his weight,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for PJ to really kind of see where he is. Obviously, he\u2019s wrestled some great wrestlers this year, but now he gets a chance to wrestle a defending national champion.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness</p>\n                <p>On Saturday against Maryland, Shayne Van Ness got off to a start that not many anticipated, as he fell behind 7-1 to then-No. 7 Carter Young.</p>\n                <p>Then, the 149-pounder exploded, as the No. 1 wrestler in his class recorded nine takedowns en route to a 31-15 win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFor Shayne himself, if we give up a takedown or give up a few points, it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of competing and with a three-point takedown, you can get back in there really fast.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said it\u2019s a great lesson for Van Ness and the team, saying the match is an example of proving you can never truly be out of the contest.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEspecially with scoring the way it is now, you can make mistakes and you can come back, so it\u2019s not really that big of a deal,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>The stage is set at Welsh Ryan Arena in Evanston, Illinois, where Penn State meets Northwestern in what is the marquee matchup of the week in the Big Ten, but not for all.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not the game to watch this week because this is a clash of titans of talent, but because, just like a Friday at work cut short, someone\u2019s going home happy.</p>\n                <p>For the Nittany Lions and their fandom, the Legion of Blue, who\u2019re watching from afar in chilly State College, it\u2019s an opportunity to earn their first conference win, as they're the lone team not to do so.</p>\n                <p>Although it\u2019ll have to attempt such a feat against a Northwestern squad that\u2019s nothing to snuff at and with almost just as much on the line, as its own fanbase, the Wildside, is one of three not to see its favorite team post a Big Ten home win.</p>\n                <p>Keep on coming</p>\n                <p>With this being a friendly home court game for the Wildcats, it\u2019s likely to be a packed crowd as the Wildside consistently shows up to root on Northwestern despite the fractured results, and this game seems no different; they won\u2019t quit.</p>\n                <p>In Northwestern\u2019s last two home games, it faced daunting tasks against ranked foes Nebraska and Illinois, with the latter game being a near sellout; there\u2019s no shortage of fandom willing to show up despite how hard it gets.</p>\n                <p>Two days before tipoff, ticket sales at Welsh Ryan Arena mirrored that sentiment, as the cheapest ticket the morning before the upcoming matchup was $44 \u2014 the price for the next three Penn State home games is $16 or less.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s an attempt to change that, with a winter ticket bundle introduced at Penn State, packaging the Beaver Stadium men\u2019s hockey game debut, a showdown featuring two of college wrestling\u2019s biggest stars, A.J. Ferrari and Mitchell Mesenbrink, and the cherry on top: entry to Penn State men\u2019s hoops hosting Minnesota when it returns home.</p>\n                <p>Although that\u2019s looking ahead, Penn State needs to endure what looks to be a lively crowd first.</p>\n                <p>History favors\u2026who?</p>\n                <p>These seasons haven\u2019t gone well, or as either coach would\u2019ve predicted, maybe past results can hint at the fate in this one. Overall, in the series, the blue and white lead 39-22, with last season\u2019s narrow 84-80 victory swinging things back in its favor.</p>\n                <p>Despite the emphatic all-time margin, it isn\u2019t smooth sailing in this millennium, as Northwestern only narrowly trails 10-11 at home in the series, suggesting that this one may lean their way. If anything, that favor is only a lean; the last eight meetings have been decided by an average of two possessions, and it looks like that narrow trend will continue.</p>\n                <p>Each squad retains only one starter from last year\u2019s game, both prominent scorers: Freddie Dilione V for Penn State and Nick Martinelli for Northwestern.</p>\n                <p>The player personnel has a shot to write new history in this matchup, yet there's an experience gap in the coaching department, to say the least. Mike Rhoades is in the midst of his third Big Ten season with Penn State, while Chris Collins is in his 13th with the Wildcats and is more than familiar with this clash.</p>\n                <p>Numbers for the nerds</p>\n                <p>Both these squads, as expected given their matching 9-11 records, the only two in the conference, stack up eerily similar.</p>\n                <p>Only a single tenth separates their scoring offenses, while only a few more separate their possession metrics. Shooting percentages, regardless of where on the floor, line up similarly, and that trend persists on the glass and assist figures, with Northwestern taking the edge in both.</p>\n                <p>Evan Miyakawa\u2019s advanced numbers also favor Northwestern, as they hold advantages in pace, consistency in performances, offensive and defensive efficiency and clear-cut roster rank. This results in the Nittany Lions' relative rating of 2.8 looking not as strong compared to the Wildcats\u2019, which is over 11.</p>\n                <p>Both have bottom-three resumes and quality of losses in the Big Ten this year, with the two alternating spots at the bottom of the rankings.</p>\n                <p>All this culminates in an edge for the Wildcats, as ESPN expects an 80% chance of them winning, though it isn\u2019t that cut-and-dry.</p>\n                <p>Behind Martinelli, the Northwestern scoring options are limited. Jayden Reid and Arrinten Page hold double-digit averages, but outside that trio, no one scores more than eight a game. For Rhoades, 60% of his ten-man rotation averages more than that figure, and as a unit, they\u2019re still one of the best teams in the Big Ten at generating steals \u2013 both shreds of optimism heading to the Midwest.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Matt Campbell has his first roster and staff in place at Penn State, so part of the efforts are now focused on building relationships with recruits in pursuit of the future.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what has happened on the recruiting trail recently.</p>\n                <p>Sights set on former commits</p>\n                <p>Prior to the firing of James Franklin, Penn State had the No. 1 ranked class in 2027 via the 247Sports Composite rankings.</p>\n                <p>Then, during the beginning of the season losing streak and removal of Franklin, all four commits backed off of their commitments.</p>\n                <p>Now that the dust has settled, and the Nittany Lions have a staff in place, part of their efforts have gone to re-establishing relationships with the former 2027 pledges.</p>\n                <p>The quartet of ex-commits are five-star running back Kemon Spell, four-star wide receiver Khalil Taylor, four-star safety Gabriel Jenkins and four-star offensive tackle Layton von Brandt.</p>\n                <p>Spell, from in-state McKeesport Area High School, is being pursued from almost all the top programs nationally.</p>\n                <p>He was originally scheduled to visit for Junior Day this past weekend, but didn\u2019t end up making it. Still, national recruiting experts have logged predictions for the tailback to restate his commitment to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Taylor and Jenkins, also Pennsylvania natives, made it to campus for Junior Day. The returns were positive, as both have scheduled an official visit for the summer. Jenkins included Penn State in his top-eight schools.</p>\n                <p>That leaves the lone non-Pennsylvania target, von Brant, who offensive line coach Ryan Clanton and Campbell visited at Appoquinimink High School in Delaware. Clanton also visited the offensive tackle a week later at home.</p>\n                <p>New, old targets emerge at Junior Day</p>\n                <p>Between targets carrying over from the last staff and ones emerging from the new staff, Penn State\u2019s Junior Day gave a first look on who could be in the future of the program.</p>\n                <p>Numerous old faces returned to campus for a weekend visit, including in-state targets in four-star 2027 wide receiver Matthew Gregory, four-star 2027 athlete Cade Cooper and four-star 2028 defensive end George Parkinson IV.</p>\n                <p>Gregory plays for Owen J Roberts High School, while Cooper and Parkinson both play for Malvern Prep, which is where defensive end Jackson Ford attended.</p>\n                <p>Four-star 2027 safety Larry Moon, from national powerhouse IMG Academy, was also in attendance. He was recruited by the previous staff, formerly playing for in-state Aliquippa High School and Central Catholic in Pittsburgh.</p>\n                <p>Other previous out-of-state targets were three-star 2027 offensive tackle Lucas Rhoa from California and 2028 defensive lineman RJ Cruz III from Maryland. Cruz plays for the McDonogh School, a recruiting hotbed for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>A Campbell target from Iowa State, four-star 2027 tight end Cooper Terwilliger from South Dakota, made the trip to State College, too. Add 2027 three-star Tommy Douglas from New Jersey powerhouse in Hun School of Princeton to the list.</p>\n                <p>Douglas, a tight end, is the son of New York Jets\u2019 general manager Joe Douglas.</p>\n                <p>And so was four-star 2027 offensive tackle Kyle Kuhn. He was previously recruited by both Penn State and Iowa State.</p>\n                <p>Recent in-state players who have emerged as targets that made it to Junior Day are Kohl\u2019s Kicking 5-star kicker Domenic Pratton from Central Valley High School and 2028 wide receiver Owen Johnson from La Salle College High School.</p>\n                <p>Westward expansion</p>\n                <p>Not only does Penn State have more reach in the Midwest with the Iowa State contingent, but the new staff has recruited the West Coast as defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn and defensive line coach Ikaika Malloe spent their past few seasons at USC and UCLA, respectively.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was active in Arizona, offering five-star 2028 defensive end Jalanie George, four-star 2027 quarterback Will Mencl, four-star 2028 wide receiver Roye Oliver III, three-star 2027 defensive lineman Yahzeen Zion, three-star 2028 athlete Keaton Fields and 2028 defensive end Landen Wade. They all play at either Desert Edge, Basha or Chandler, three top-10 programs in the state, per MaxPreps.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions also dished out offers to California recruits in four-star 2027 safety Isala Aisa Wily-Ava, three-star 2027 linebacker Josiah Poyer, three-star 2027 defensive lineman Montana Toilolo. Wily-Ava and Poyer play for St. John Bosco while Toilolo plays for Mater Dei, which is where cornerback Daryus Dixson played.</p>\n                <p>To round it out, there was also a quartet of offers in Washington to five-star 2028 tight end Tytan McNeal, three-star 2027 cornerback and Washington commit Maurice Willams, three-star 2027 defensive lineman Tevita Nonu and 2030 defensive lineman Tyson Daniels.</p>\n                <p>Junior Day approach</p>\n                <p>When Franklin was running the show, Junior Day had more bodies compared to what Campbell orchestrated for the first rendition of the event for him at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>There are a couple of reasons for this, with the weekend\u2019s snow storm potentially being one of them, but the overarching point of this was to create a more intimate environment.</p>\n                <p>It allows for all the new staff to interact with targets that remain from the previous staff, meeting them for either the first or second time if recruits had an in-home or at school visit.</p>\n                <p>The same kind of approach can be said for staffers who were retained from a season ago, it gives them the same opportunity to converse with players who were looked at as Iowa State targets.</p>\n                <p>Overall, a smaller turnout allows for more face-to-face attention, and gives a feeling of being pursued more as opposed to being one of many there for the festivities.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

This call, however, wasn\u2019t to wish him luck against then-No. 5 Wisconsin, which Penn State swept over the weekend.</p>\n                <p>It was to ask if former Nittany Lions legend, and now Green Bay Packers superstar, Micah Parsons, could come support his alma mater at the Kohl Center, where then-No. 8 Penn State and the Badgers were playing. Gadowsky, who said Parsons was a \u201cbig [Gavin] McKenna fan,\u201d welcomed the former Penn State linebacker with open arms for their contest on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was so cool to meet him,\u201d Gadowsky said to the media on Tuesday evening. \u201cHe is such an amazing Penn Stater\u2026 He\u2019s one of the best athletes there is. But boy does he love Penn State, and the words that he said to our team were awesome. His message was awesome. And he just so clearly loves Penn State.

Gadowsky said he gave Parsons a time frame of around 7:05 p.m. for when the team would be coming in from warm-ups. Parsons arrived at 5 p.m., before Gadowsky was even in the locker room.</p>\n                <p>In his time with the team postgame, as after any other Penn State win, the team THOR hammer, which is given to a player who, in Gadowsky\u2019s words on Tengwall\u2019s live show, \u201cfights the hardest (and) just does something spectacular for a win,\u201d was given out.</p>\n                <p>Parsons was given the opportunity to hold it and threw it down on a table in the center of the locker room, hyping the team up as the top of the hammer flew to the opposite side of the room. Luckily, Gadowsky said the hammer was fixed.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cIt was fun. It was perfect. It's not the first time (the hammer has) been broken. But that was the best time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It was a special moment for the players, too. Penn State\u2019s coach said on Tengwall\u2019s show that stars Aiden Fink and Jackson Smith, being from Calgary, are huge Green Bay Packers fans. Fink, specifically, was \u201cjacked\u201d to meet Parsons.</p>\n                <p>Nittany Lions captain Dane Dowiak was also pumped to see him. He remembered watching Parsons play at Beaver Stadium on his visit years ago.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, he's just a Penn Stater at heart,\u201d Dowiak said. \u201cAnd I thought that was the coolest thing. And he said, through all his success throughout his career, there's no place like Penn State and wearing the blue and white. And before the game, when he told us that, I don't think anybody looked back. I think we all looked at each other and we said, \u2018We're going to get this done.\u2019 Just to have him by our side, especially when he plays in Wisconsin, having him by our side wearing that Penn State hockey jersey was really cool.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Gadowsky told media that the forward is still \u201cday-to-day\u201d, but also adding \u201cwe expect him back soon.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Scouting of Michigan State</p>\n                <p>This is the second time the blue and white will see Michigan State, after getting swept in East Lansing back in November.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe think that we\u2019re a much better team now than we were back then,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cFrom a number of ways, and from a number of lessons, not just from that first series.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Spartans have been one of the top teams in the country in almost every aspect and boast one of collegiate hockey\u2019s top goaltenders in Trey Augustine.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBottom line is they\u2019re a really well-balanced team\u2026they do everything really, really well,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not a matter of finding the kinks in the armor, because I don\u2019t think that there are, it\u2019s a matter of us playing as good and consistent a game as you can.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>As January reaches its end, softball season looms around the corner. Penn State is set to kick off its 2026 campaign on Feb. 6 at the NFCA Leadoff Classic in Clearwater, Florida.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions finished 2025 with a 25-27 record and failed to reach a second straight NCAA Regional appearance. Last season, the blue and white were highlighted by its performance in the batter\u2019s box, but struggled from inside the pitcher's circle.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s staff completed last year with the highest ERA in the Big Ten at 5.76. With a highly anticipated comeback, a returning starter and new additions, the Nittany Lions have a chance to improve in the circle in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Bridget Nemeth</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-1 junior right-hander missed a majority of the 2025 season with an injury. Nemeth\u2019s only appearance came in the blue and white\u2019s second game of the season against Texas Tech, in which she faced just four batters.</p>\n                <p>However, two years ago, the Glendora, California, native had a rookie campaign for the ages. In 2024, Nemeth was the Big Ten Freshman of the Year and was a unanimous First-Team All-Big Ten selection. Additionally, she was the first player in program history to be named a Freshman All-American, earning recognition by both D1 Softball and Softball America.</p>\n                <p>Nemeth finished the season with a 23-8 record, setting a program best in single-season victories. The right-hander pitched 210 innings, starting 25 of 40 appearances. Nemeth\u2019s 1.77 ERA ranked second in the Big Ten, and her 202 strikeouts placed third.</p>\n                <p>After a year on the sidelines, Nemeth enters the upcoming season with much anticipation. If her dominant freshman campaign has any indication, it\u2019s that the junior has the talent and poise to once again anchor the Nittany Lions\u2019 pitching staff. Nemeth\u2019s return could be a turning point for the blue and white, and a reminder of just how special she can be in the circle.</p>\n                <p>Abigail Britton</p>\n                <p>Britton is the lone returner from Penn State\u2019s pitching staff last season. The sophomore right-hander split a majority of the time in the circle with the since graduated Mady Volpe. The two combined for 242.2 of the team's 316 total innings pitched.</p>\n                <p>In 2025, Britton made 42 appearances while tallying 21 starts. The LaVale, Maryland, native finished with a 6-10 record and 5.89 ERA. While Britton didn\u2019t put up the most staggering numbers in these regards, the right-hander was best when it came to closing games out.</p>\n                <p>Britton\u2019s five saves tied for the most in the Big Ten and already place the sophomore fifth in the Penn State record books for career saves.</p>\n                <p>Britton, now with a year of experience under her belt, will be a key part of helping the Nittany Lions improve their pitching numbers.</p>\n                <p>New faces</p>\n                <p>Along with the familiar arms in the circle, the blue and white also welcome its fair share of new ones.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps the biggest new addition to coach Clarisa Crowell\u2019s pitching staff is South Dakota transfer McKenna Young. The junior right-hander arrives off a breakout season with the Coyotes.</p>\n                <p>Young was a Second-Team All-Summit League selection after posting a 14-8 record with a 2.46 ERA. The Broadhead, Wisconsin, native finished the season with 152 strikeouts, and her 8.3 strikeouts per seven innings ranked No. 28 nationally. Additionally, Young's five complete-game shutouts placed her at No. 31 in the country.</p>\n                <p>Penn State also welcomes a fresh crop of rookies to its rotation, which includes two-way player Gabby Gradishar, alongside left-handers Brevyn Kellepouris and Mackenzie Duncan.</p>\n                <p>Gradishar was the No. 54 prospect and No. 18 pitcher/utility player out of Champion, Ohio. She was a two-time First-Team All-State selection, as well as being named a Second-Team All-American by MaxPreps in her senior season.</p>\n                <p>Kellepouris hails from Olathe, Kansas, and was a First-Team All-State selection in her final two seasons at Olathe West High School.</p>\n                <p>Duncan arrives in Happy Valley out of Winter Garden, Florida. The 5-foot-10 left-hander was ranked as the No. 58 overall player and No. 25 pitcher by Extra Inning Softball.</p>\n                <p>With lots of new depth that includes a mix of proven experience and high-upside newcomers, Penn State enters 2026 with cautious optimism and plenty to prove in the circle. If Nemeth can return to form, Britton continues to grow into her role and the new faces find comfort quickly, the Nittany Lions have the pieces to turn last year\u2019s biggest weakness into a strength.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Review | 7 Brew Coffee offers caffeine kick to State College",
    "author": "Lily Dorf | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>State College received a caffeine boost with Arkansas-based coffee and energy drink bar 7 Brew Coffee opening up at 1923 S Atherton St, this winter. The store is open from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, and offers coffee, energy drinks, teas and non-caffeinated options with customizations allowed for all.</p>\n                <p>This week, I ventured over to try out some of the new and exciting flavors of the various drink options.</p>\n                <p>Pixie Stick 7 Energy</p>\n                <p>I chose to order three drinks with the Pixie Stick 7 Energy being the first. The flavors within the drink help bring out the classic Pixie Stick flavor, combining orange, pomegranate and almond. I would say this drink has hints of a Pixie Stick flavor, with the orange coming out more than the other two.</p>\n                <p>My first sip tasted more like a cherry slushie, however after a few sips I started to taste the hints of orange and some slight pomegranate. The flavors within the drink are not incredibly overpowering, giving the drink a nice, balanced flavor.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately, the Pixie Stick 7 Energy was a bit too sweet for me. If you are a fan of sweeter energy drinks, this is definitely the one for you. This drink can be customized with the original energy base or with their sugar-free option.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 7/10</p>\n                <p>Peaches N\u2019 Cream 7 Fizz</p>\n                <p>This was the second drink I tried, opting for a non-caffeinated option to see how they compared to the caffeinated drinks offered.</p>\n                <p>The fizz drinks are made with a base of unflavored sparkling water, with syrups being added to give each drink its signature flavor.</p>\n                <p>Peaches N\u2019 Cream is made with peach and vanilla syrups, which can be substituted for sugar-free versions as well.</p>\n                <p>The sweetness level went down with this drink compared to the first, giving it a nice and refreshing flavor palette. It had the same essence as a peach ring candy, with the vanilla syrup being hard to pinpoint within the drink.</p>\n                <p>Because of this, the flavor and overall taste of the soda were not over the top, but still present, having more flavor than other sparkling water drinks. I could see this being a very refreshing drink to grab in the heat of the summer, or something to sip on while relaxing in the sun.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Snickerdoodle Mocha</p>\n                <p>This was the last and final drink I tried during my review, with it being the heaviest. The Snickerdoodle Mocha is a part of the store's 7 Classics, along with six other coffee-based drinks.</p>\n                <p>The drink contains a brown sugar cinnamon syrup mixed with vanilla mocha, and of course espresso. The Snickerdoodle Mocha also comes in a decaf option and has many customizations like milk type, sweetness level, toppings and sugar-free brown sugar cinnamon syrup.</p>\n                <p>The cinnamon within the drink was strong but not over the top, letting the mocha and coffee shine through. It was not extremely sweet like I had expected, which was a nice surprise. However, if you are not a big fan of mocha, I would opt for a different drink or customize the syrup.</p>\n                <p>The coffee also did not have a strong or bitter taste to it, helping to balance the drink out well. If strong coffee is what you usually go for, I would suggest asking for a lower sweetness level to your liking.</p>\n                <p>Overall, the flavors did not clash and made for a smooth and sweet drink.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Final Thoughts</p>\n                <p>As someone who tries to steer clear of drinking too much caffeine throughout the day \u2014 whether that's energy drinks or coffee altogether \u2014 it was amazing to see so many options offered for those who are also looking to lower their caffeine intake.</p>\n                <p>With such a variety of drinks on the menu, this is an amazing spot to check out before class, on your way to a long study session or just to grab a few tasty drinks with friends.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After obtaining a 33-23 overall record and reaching the Big Ten semifinals, Penn State looks to reach the postseason for a third-straight year with a promising pitching staff.</p>\n                <p>However, losing an ace to the MLB Draft in Ryan DeSanto could pose a threat to third-year head coach Mike Gambino. The skipper turned to the transfer portal in an attempt to fill a void in the starting rotation.</p>\n                <p>Starters</p>\n                <p>Gambino found a possible hidden gem in Kyle Lazer through the portal. Lazer spent four years at West Chester and joined Penn State as a redshirt senior. While transitioning from a Division II to a Division I school can be unusual, Lazer arrives off his best season by far.</p>\n                <p>The right-handed pitcher made 13 starts and earned an 8-3 record. In those 13 appearances, Lazer recorded a 3.17 ERA with 75 strikeouts in 71 innings.</p>\n                <p>While competition will surely ramp up for the Havertown, Pennsylvania, native, he has the chance to find himself a starting role and continue to produce great outings.</p>\n                <p>Frankie Sanchez looks to make his return to the rotation after being out the entirety of the 2025 season with injury. Before being injured, the right-handed pitcher threw 27 strikeouts in 37.2 innings.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt senior will have a shot to end his final collegiate season with stellar outings and continue to add to the starting rotation.</p>\n                <p>Relievers</p>\n                <p>The bullpen received a couple of additions through the portal, as well. One being Ben Hudson from West Virginia.</p>\n                <p>The right-handed pitcher saw 27.1 innings in which he recorded 30 strikeouts. Hudson didn\u2019t allow a run in any game where he pitched more than an inning. The Medford, New Jersey, native did his part in getting the Mountaineers to the NCAA Super Regionals.</p>\n                <p>Of the returning arms, Matthew VanOstenbridge looks to continue to produce for the bullpen after making 23 appearances in his freshman year. The southpaw recorded a 4.32 ERA, striking out 38 in 41.2 innings.</p>\n                <p>VanOstenbridge will continue to be a hot arm out of the bullpen.</p>\n                <p>Similar to Sanchez, Ben DeMell enters his final collegiate season as a redshirt senior after a promising 2025 season. The right-handed pitcher brought his ERA down to 4.65 after doubling his previous strikeout total to 43.</p>\n                <p>The Concord, Ohio, native brings a towering figure at 6-foot-5 and 205 pounds, a size that could shake batters as they will be awaiting strong and fast pitches from the mound.</p>\n                <p>From dipping into the transfer portal to returning arms in the bullpen, Gambino sets his pitching room up in hopes of making it further than the semifinals in the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Most of the time, they\u2019ve just faded into the background.</p>\n                <p>Dress for your real day</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s easy to keep clothes for a version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Outfits for plans you never make, pieces that only work if you\u2019re suddenly a morning person or the clothes that looked good once but don\u2019t fit your day-to-day anymore can all be discarded.</p>\n                <p>Dress for your real schedule, not the one you swear you\u2019ll have \u201cnext week.\u201d Long walks to class, lecture halls, quick food and unpredictable weather don\u2019t need complicated outfits. They require clothes that feel comfortable, easy and reliable.</p>\n                <p>When your clothes actually fit your routine, getting dressed stops feeling like a daily struggle and just happens.</p>\n                <p>Rotate what\u2019s in front</p>\n                <p>If you see the same five things every morning, surprise, that\u2019s all you\u2019re wearing. A closet reset can be as simple as \u201coh wait, I forgot I owned this.\u201d Sometimes all it takes is moving one thing to the front for it to feel new again.</p>\n                <p>Most mornings are rushed. You\u2019re just trying to get to class on time, grab coffee and remember what\u2019s due, not plan an outfit.</p>\n                <p>When you\u2019re half awake, you grab whatever\u2019s easiest. That\u2019s why the same stuff\u2019s on repeat, not because the rest doesn\u2019t work.</p>\n                <p>Changing what\u2019s in front breaks that pattern. A few little changes can stop you from grabbing the same thing without thinking.</p>\n                <p>Stop saving outfits for \u201csomeday\u201d</p>\n                <p>A lot of clothes sit untouched because they\u2019re being saved for the \u201cright occasion.\u201d The problem is this imaginary event almost never happens, and if it does, you\u2019ll probably end up wearing something else anyway.</p>\n                <p>College life is mostly made up of regular days. Classes, studying, quick plans and walking across campus don\u2019t exactly scream \u201cspecial occasion.\u201d Those are the days you\u2019re actually living.</p>\n                <p>If you like something, wear it now. Don\u2019t save it for a night that may or may not come, or a plan that might get canceled at the last minute. Clothes don\u2019t need to be a big moment, they just need a reason to leave your closet.</p>\n                <p>Worst case, you wear it to class and nothing happens. Best case, you feel a little more put together on a very normal day. Honestly, that\u2019s a win.</p>\n                <p>Let comfort do the work</p>\n                <p>A good outfit doesn\u2019t need to be impressive. It just needs to feel good enough that you\u2019re not thinking about it all day or constantly adjusting it between classes.</p>\n                <p>Jeans that fit well, hoodies that don\u2019t itch and shoes you can actually walk across campus in matter way more than trends. When you\u2019re comfortable, you\u2019re not distracted by what you\u2019re wearing, and that confidence shows \u2014 even on days when just getting dressed feels like enough.</p>\n                <p>If you\u2019re fixing your clothes all day, they\u2019re not doing their job. Comfort matters when your days are long and you\u2019re always on the move. The best outfits are the ones you forget you\u2019re even wearing.</p>\n                <p>Outfit repeating is allowed</p>\n                <p>Wearing a jacket twice in one week? That\u2019s normal behavior. It\u2019s kind of impressive you didn\u2019t lose it between classes or leave it on a chair somewhere.</p>\n                <p>If it makes mornings easier, it earns a repeat. Most people aren\u2019t paying attention to what you\u2019re wearing , they\u2019re focused on getting through their own chaos, making it to class on time and remembering when their next exam is.</p>\n                <p>Outfit repetition is the least of anyone\u2019s concerns. If it makes your day easier, that\u2019s all it really needs to do.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Jadzia Santiago | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>So, you\u2019ve read TikTok\u2019s new terms of service. Or, rather, you opened the app and hit \u201cAgree\u201d, only to look at the news three hours later and read that (allegedly) you just sold everything but your soul for your 8 a.m. dose of hopelessness and hot influencers.</p>\n                <p>That didn\u2019t faze you at first. As someone who\u2019s terminally online, you\u2019re no stranger to making problems for yourself.</p>\n                <p>But now that sale (also allegedly) has sociopolitical implications?</p>\n                <p>I mean, they\u2019re tracking information \u201cyou disclose\u201d about your \u201cracial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information,\u201d ehhh macarena.</p>\n                <p>Sounds like a lot, and feels a little relevant. Well, doomscrollers rejoice, because this really isn\u2019t that big a deal!</p>\n                <p>First off, as your local tinfoil hat would argue, it\u2019s nothing that Big Tech wasn\u2019t doing anyway. Anyone familiar with the demonic wiles of 5G (and the terms and conditions of other social media apps) knows just how much information They take from you anyway.</p>\n                <p>Now they\u2019re just being open about it, which isn\u2019t worrying at all. Privacy, in the digital age? Pssssh.</p>\n                <p>And besides, best case scenario is that they\u2019re using that data for, you guessed it, ads!</p>\n                <p>All they wanna do is sell you solutions to your deepest insecurities and darkest fears.</p>\n                <p>Acne? There\u2019s an unregulated supplement with no ingredient list for that. Stomach fat? Brutal shapewear that crushes your lungs. All followed by 20 videos about how unlovable those traits are, so you gotta get rid of them stat.</p>\n                <p>Speaking of love, are you worried about coming out to your parents (because you may not know how many times you watched that thirst trap, but your data does)? Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll send more and more ads for pride merch to the family TV!</p>\n                <p>Never worry about being homesick again, because having someone to strategically gather your secrets and use them against you will make you feel like you\u2019re always with your family.</p>\n                <p>Who needs to use that information for something like diagnosing health conditions when you can sell it?</p>\n                <p>All harmless \u2014 of course, unless you\u2019re starting to develop the Wrong Opinions. And they can tell when you are, you know.</p>\n                <p>But like, with an all-seeing presence devoted to moral goodness like this, how could you ever go wrong in life? When not even your step count or your resting heart rate are yours anymore, it feels a little like having a guardian angel.</p>\n                <p>Considering how lonely we all are right now, I think we need a companion. And the algorithm might just be the snuggliest machine gun the world has ever seen.</p>\n                <p>Come on, not even your boyfriend listens to you this much.</p>\n                <p>Even if the government really is collecting your data to use it for who knows what, that doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t you know that your seasonal allergies, tarot cards, celebrity crushes and pronouns are all matters of national security?</p>\n                <p>Forget anything else, you, the little nerd scrolling through fan edits of Joe Keery and Maya Hawke in \u201cStranger Things\u201d should be our biggest priority as a nation.</p>\n                <p>Maybe it\u2019ll make you a little nervous if you\u2019re politically outspoken, but we live in a democracy with freedom of speech, so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue \u2026 right?</p>\n                <p>Anyway! All in all, these open, honest changes to TikTok really make me hopeful for the future. Years from now, I can still see myself opening the app for a dopamine hit when the real world becomes just too much.</p>\n                <p>And one day, when the algorithm notices I\u2019m spending .0002 seconds too long watching another woman\u2019s makeup tutorial, they\u2019ll set to work to protect the streets from my moral poison.</p>\n                <p>Onto my friends\u2019 feeds will come a slew of posts on How to Spot Female Narcissists and Energy Vampires, top traits being Has opinions, thoughts and feelings and Wants to hang out occasionally.</p>\n                <p>The solution? Grab your essential oils and cut her off, girlfriend! And just when I\u2019m isolated enough to have no character witnesses, they\u2019ll put me in front of the almighty Thought Crimes tribunal.</p>\n                <p>There, ChatGPT will convict me of the capital crimes of vanity, envy and lust before sentencing me to the Grok-powered death ray that, because I\u2019m a woman, will only vaporize my clothes. #FeministOwned.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Surrounded by her teammates, sophomore Nicole Hall received the call of a lifetime with an invitation to the 2026 Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOne of the teammates filmed her getting the call from the Swedish officials, and it was just pure joy on her face and her reaction,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal told The Daily Collegian. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty genuine response, and I\u2019m proud of her for putting in the time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While only a sophomore at Penn State, Hall experienced international play well before she takes on the Olympics in February.</p>\n                <p>The Stockholm, Sweden, native competed on a pair of teams in the Swedish Women\u2019s Hockey League before representing her country on the 18U Swedish team at the 2021 and 2022 World Championships.</p>\n                <p>When Hall arrived at Penn State in 2024, she already had six years of international and semi-professional experience.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a great teammate,\u201d sophomore Abby Stonehouse said. \u201cShe\u2019s super fun to be around, helps her teammates out, and then on the ice, is obviously a great player, high hockey IQ and makes her line mates better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Right off the bat, Hall took the ice for the Nittany Lions and her presence had a positive influence on her team.</p>\n                <p>While playing in all 38 games in her freshman year, Hall recorded seven goals and four assists. Just two weeks into the season, the forward recorded her first and second career goals in back-to-back games against Union and Dartmouth.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAll the practices, the games, (work) off the ice, on the ice has helped me,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThe coaches are willing to help all day, and my teammates are making me a better hockey player every day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As a freshman, Hall stood up and helped her teammates down the stretch of a successful season as the Nittany Lions earned a spot in the AHA semifinals against RIT.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI watched her in the world championships when she was the captain of the U18 Sweden team,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe made it with those little things like winning plays, having good habits and being a good teammate. We knew she had leadership capabilities.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Hall\u2019s success was on display throughout the postseason as she recorded two blocks and a faceoff victory as she wrapped up her first year as an AHA champion.</p>\n                <p>Entering her second season, Hall\u2019s efforts were even more on display as she increased her work ethic and put in the work ahead of Year 2.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(The biggest thing I learned from her) is how hard she works,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cShe never takes a shift off. She\u2019s always in there, so she just taught me to always keep my feet moving and work hard.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Just as the Nittany Lions opened 2025 with success \u2014 earning 16 straight wins \u2014 Hall found her own success with goals in each of the first two games of the year.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNicole and her teammates kind of run the show in terms of how they want their season to go,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe just brings that lunch pail, work hard mentality to Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After 16 straight wins, Penn State suffered its first loss of the season against Northeastern on Nov. 28. With the help of Hall\u2019s mentality, the blue and white came back and went on an 8-3 stretch since then.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSometimes you can get frustrated a bit, but she just keeps up the positive energy,\u201d graduate student Mya Vaslet said. \u201cShe just keeps saying, \u2018Just trust the process, it\u2019ll come,\u2019 and I think that\u2019s really important too.\u201d</p>\n                <p>On Jan. 12, Hall received a phone call from the Swedish national team, giving her the news that she would be competing in her first Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe were all really excited,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cI know she was waiting to get the call, but there wasn\u2019t a doubt in any of our minds she wasn\u2019t going to get it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Hall has played for the senior women\u2019s team in 15 contests, February will mark her first time suiting up for the Olympic Games, a memory she\u2019ll never forget.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI started crying right away when they told me I have a ticket for the Olympics,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI was speechless, I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In addition to Hall taking the big stage, her teammates Matilde Fantin, Tessa Janecke and former Nittany Lion Jessica Adolfsson will all compete in the Olympics as well.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo matter (what position) you play at Penn State hockey, we get better day in and day out,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cIt shows with people going to the Olympics.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After competing in their first preliminary contest on Feb. 5 against Germany, Hall and Team Sweden will face off against Fantin and Team Italy on Feb. 7.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLet the best woman win,\u201d Hall said.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Position preview | Penn State softball brings in young outfielders",
    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s 2026 season is rapidly approaching, with its season opener in the near future. The Nittany Lions are poised for a bounce-back year after finishing 25-27 and missing the NCAA tournament in 2025.</p>\n                <p>While the blue and white have a plethora of returners on the infield, its outfield will be filled with mostly fresh faces in the new campaign. After the pair of veteran outfielders, Jenna Nelson and Haylie Brunson, graduated, Clarisa Crowell\u2019s squad is left with two open positions in the outfield.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Natalie Lieto spearheads the outfield as the lone returner this season for the Nittany Lions, while junior Frankee Flesher and freshman Breanna Hanik are set for their first seasons.</p>\n                <p>Natalie Lieto</p>\n                <p>The Monroe, Connecticut, native had a breakout freshman campaign on both sides of the field last season. Lieto brings experience as she started all 50 games she played in, slashing an impressive .329 batting average, with seven home runs and 30 RBIs in 149 at bats. Her 49 hits were fifth-most on the team in Penn State\u2019s historic 2025 offensive campaign.</p>\n                <p>The 5-foot-7 outfielder also flashed the glove, surrendering just one error and finishing with an outstanding 0.990 fielding percentage. Lieto\u2019s lockdown defense didn\u2019t go unnoticed, as she was one of just two true freshmen to be named to the Big Ten All-Defensive Team.</p>\n                <p>Lieto also reached base often with an efficient .936 OPS and was sneaky on the basepaths, stealing 10 bases in 12 attempts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State must continue to get this production and more from its star outfielder in Lieto\u2019s sophomore campaign. She\u2019s essential for anchoring the defense in the outfield alongside two rookie players.</p>\n                <p>Frankee Flesher</p>\n                <p>The Chesterland, Ohio, native enters her first collegiate softball season after she joined the program following the conclusion of the 2025 season. The junior was previously a member of the women\u2019s soccer team before medically retiring from the sport.</p>\n                <p>Flesher brings two years of varsity softball experience at West Gauga High School and a few years of travel experience with the Ohio Outlaws 05 National program from 2019 to 2021 into Happy Valley. As a standout soccer player in high school, she is versatile and extremely athletic, allowing her to be spread out across the outfield.</p>\n                <p>The 5-foot-5 outfielder\u2019s last softball season was outstanding. As a sophomore at West Gauga High School, the lefty batter produced a .629 average with 39 hits and 22 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>Breanna Hanik</p>\n                <p>The Oak Lawn, Illinois, native was a standout recruit in the 2025 class, ranked as the nation\u2019s No. 65 overall player and No. 22 among outfielders. Hanik led Marist High School to the state championship game in three seasons throughout her four years and was named an All-Conference choice in 2023 and 2024.</p>\n                <p>Her breakout junior campaign earned her All-State, All-Area and Golden Glove awards, and she also set a single-season doubles record with 19. Hanik is the whole package of speed, power, and defense, recording 11 home runs and 16 stolen bases in one season.</p>\n                <p>With young players throughout the outfield and playing together for the first time, Crowell may switch around their positions during the season. The fresh talent brings much to look forward to on both sides of the field for the blue and white\u2019s faithful fans.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

Prior to Milano-Cortina, the lone Penn Stater to appear in the games was <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/women_hockey/built-in-happy-valley-jessica-adolfsson-s-journey-from-penn-state-women-s-hockey-to/article_6502cbb7-9493-435b-8a76-39ebc388452f.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sweden\u2019s Jessica Adolfsson</a>, who\u2019ll be returning to international action to play alongside Hall and face her fellow Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>From the moment Janecke stepped into the locker room at Pegula Ice Arena, coach Jeff Kampersal said he noticed one thing \u2014 her innate drive to win.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Janecke\u2019s) got incredible drive and she also has a mean streak, too,\u201d Kampersal said. So, if you look at Tessa or Abbey Murphy from Minnesota, those kids can stay by you. They can run you over, and they're driven towards their goals, whether it's making the Olympics or it's trying to win a national championship.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Among the many Olympic rosters are a mix of professional talent from the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League (PWHL), top-tier collegiate players and veterans of international competition, making the Olympics the truest form of \u201cbest-on-best\u201d hockey.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPeople only see a fraction of the work that (Janecke) puts in, that our team puts in, so for her to go out there knowing that this was her dream, there's no way you can put it into words,\u201d Katelyn Roberts said. \u201cAs a friend, I'm proud. As her teammate, I'm proud. As a watcher of hers, I'm proud. There's no other way to say it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Janecke isn\u2019t merely a face amongst the many other superstars; she\u2019s carved a legacy of her own.</p>\n                <p>With the U.S. National Team, Janecke is a two-time IIHF Women\u2019s World Champion and one-time runner-up, winning her first in 2023 and most recently in 2025, with a silver medal in 2024 between the victories.</p>\n                <p>She also earned a silver medal in the 2022 IIHF U18 Women\u2019s World Junior Championship.</p>\n                <p>Last April in Czechia, Janecke tapped in the \u201cgolden goal\u201d on a backdoor feed from the Minnesota Frost\u2019s Taylor Heise with 2:53 remaining in overtime to win the 2025 IIHF Women\u2019s World Championship, 4-3, over Canada. Before her teammates swarmed her in celebration, Janecke leapt into the air and hoisted her stick into the stands.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThose are not only huge moments for (Janecke), which we're proud of her for, but also, they put our program on the map,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cShe is such a talented player, and we were so lucky to have her come here. It\u2019s a testament to the amount of skill that our team has and also how much the program has changed under coach Jeff, especially over the past couple of years, with him being able to bring in that top-caliber talent.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In 2023, Janecke scored three goals and added three helpers throughout the tournament to aid the United States in winning the gold medal against the hosting nation, Canada.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(The Olympics are) going to be on a much bigger scale,\u201d Janecke said. \u201cThere are a lot more eyes on you, but I think for our team, nothing is going to change. We\u2019ve got to go in there with the right mindset, but there can't be a moment that's going to be too big or one that we're not prepared for.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Janecke is currently riding the high of a 40-point season with the Nittany Lions, including an eight-game point streak. She leads Penn State with 19 goals and 21 assists heading into her break in action from the NCAA.</p>\n                <p>On the national scale this season, Janecke ranks ninth in points and eighth in goals. That includes her missing a few games due to her playing in the 2025 Rivalry Series, a four-game showcase against Team Canada that the United States swept. There, Janecke tallied a goal and two assists.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's definitely posed more as an opportunity than a loss because it's an amazing opportunity for (Janecke), and there's no way she should pass this up,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cFor us, we kind of see it as an opportunity for our forwards to grow and to gain depth for our team, so that when she does come back, we're in a groove scoring and she'll be in her groove scoring, and all the pieces will fit together at the right time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite having to miss collegiate action for a month in Europe, Janecke\u2019s senior season isn\u2019t over yet. With the AHA and NCAA tournaments waiting for her when she returns to Happy Valley, the captain has one more chance to secure the coveted National Championship with her alma mater.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMaybe we're not as formidable without Tessa, Nicole and Matilde, but we're still pretty deep, and we're still going to show up and play hard,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cAnd I think our players want to prove that they can do it without those three players as well. When they come back, they'll be even stronger.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Having already left campus for training camps, Janecke will be missing the rest of the regular season as well as the first round of the upcoming AHA playoffs. This includes Penn State\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/women_hockey/penn-state-women-s-hockey-announces-time-for-beaver-stadium-game/article_9d29d530-cd70-4663-901d-feb4ce2771a3.html\" target=\"_blank\">first-ever outdoor game at Beaver Stadium against Robert Morris</a>.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'm going to be missing games, but I have confidence in our team that they're going to be just fine without me,\u201d Janecke said. \u201cAnd honestly, I think they'll play even harder knowing that I'm gone as well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>Marcus Blaze entered Happy Valley as the No. 1 wrestler in the 2025 recruiting class. Before even wrestling in a blue and white singlet, Blaze took the international world by storm.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019s a U17 and U20 World Champion, placed third at the 2024 Olympic Trials as an 18-year old and owns four state championships in Ohio. He left Perrysburg High School with a 196-2 record.</p>\n                <p>All of those accolades made it seem like Blaze would be a contender for the national title, no matter the weight class he was in. Blaze is currently No. 4 in the national rankings, but the competition at 133 pounds continues to get deeper and deeper following the potential burning of multiple redshirts.</p>\n                <p>To begin, the national finalists last year \u2014 Lucas Byrd of Illinois and Iowa\u2019s Drake Ayala \u2014 are back for another year. To emphasize the depth of this weight class, Ayala, who\u2019s been on the verge of a national title for the past couple years, is No. 9 in the country, according to InterMat.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State redshirt freshman Ben Davino has been unleashed for the Buckeyes and is a big reason for them being No. 2 in the NWCA rankings. Davino holds a 15-0 record and could pose as the biggest threat to Blaze\u2019s undefeated dual season when Ohio State travels to the Bryce Jordan Center in February.</p>\n                <p>The other Big Ten competitor is Zan Fugitt out of Wisconsin. Fugitt ranks at No. 12 and adds to the young crop of talent. Fugitt is a redshirt sophomore and placed fourth at the NCAA Tournament last season in his first full season of competition.</p>\n                <p>Out of the Big 12, No. 3 Evan Frost from Iowa State appears to be the favorite for the conference title with Arizona State\u2019s Kyler Larkin not far behind him at No. 6 with a 14-1 record. Frost didn\u2019t wrestle against the Sun Devils when the Cyclones defeated them 29-14 on Jan. 6.</p>\n                <p>Behind them is Dominick Sorrano, who holds a 9-0 record out of Northern Colorado.</p>\n                <p>Despite the three Big 12 wrestlers, and Big Ten wrestlers who could all earn the national title spot, there\u2019s two new freshmen that are expected to burn their redshirts and will instantly become contenders.</p>\n                <p>Oklahoma State no longer has a problem at 133 pounds after Jax Forrest enrolled early with the Cowboys. Forrest was a 2025 U23 World Champion, as well as a 2025 US Open champion.</p>\n                <p>Forrest instantly becomes a favorite for the national title, and a Blaze-Forrest title match would likely break the internet. It\u2019d be the first time Cael Sanderson and David Taylor sat across from each other at the biggest stage, and for it to be two of the best young stars in the sport facing off, the hype for the matchup would be palpable.</p>\n                <p>The other freshman who\u2019s expected to burn his redshirt is Virginia Tech\u2019s Aaron Seidel. In his most recent match, Seidel took down then-No. 7 Tyler Knox of Stanford, 13-0. In one of his first matches of his young career, Seidel took down Dylan Shawver, the 2024 Big Ten Champion, by tech fall, solidifying his arrival onto the scene.</p>\n                <p>With Forrest and Seidel\u2019s emergence, in addition to the other major competitors, the 133-pound weight class could cause chaos come NCAA Tournament time, making Blaze\u2019s path to the final a tough task.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Matilde Fantin has spent the last few months traveling from Penn State to Italy\u2019s Olympic camp in Canada, gearing up daily for early-morning skates and playing in multiple games in hopes of achieving a childhood dream.</p>\n                <p>Following months of preparation, the freshman can now call herself an Olympian.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI still need to realize it\u2019s actually real,\u201d Fantin told The Daily Collegian. \u201cI\u2019m really happy, and I\u2019m excited to show how good (Team Italy) is. I\u2019m excited to represent my country again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Como, Italy, native\u2019s path to reaching the Olympics has been nothing short of impressive. Before making her start at Penn State, Fantin had the honor to represent her country at the 2025 IIHF Division 1B Women\u2019s World Championship. She used this monumental stage to showcase her talent, leading the tournament with 10 points.</p>\n                <p>The skills shown by Fantin stood out to coach Jeff Kampersal in his recruiting process, leading to one of the most impactful additions to the lineup.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMatilde is a hard worker. She looks like a pro and has a pro skill set in the way that she plays with her head up,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe does a lot of good things, like creating time and space. She's really smart. She takes instructions, so she shows a willingness to get better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Fantin adjusted quickly to collegiate hockey, as she has already won multiple AHA conference awards. Most notably, being the Freshman of the Month in September and October.</p>\n                <p>More than halfway through her freshman season, the forward showed her willingness to learn through her on-ice training with upperclassmen. As a result, Fantin believes that playing for Penn State has been a great place for her to \u201cplay and grow.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think just having the chance to go on the ice with really good players and training with them,\u201d Fantin said. \u201cAlso, having the chance to experience playing with Tessa (Janecke) and some of the seniors is just great. It's a great environment to grow.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Off the ice, Fantin has found a connection with fellow international freshman, Danica Maynard. The Lake Country, British Columbia, native has been beside Fantin every step of the way on and off the ice.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Fantin and I) understand each other, and we understand that we may be missing home sometimes and we can\u2019t contact (our families),\u201d Maynard said. \u201cJust being able to look out for each other, that\u2019s a really good spot for us. We never feel alone.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Fantin said she\u2019s leaned heavily on herself for support over the past few months.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust feeling good about myself and having my confidence up. It's always hard, especially when you see other people that are fighting for a spot, and you're in the same situation,\u201d Fantin said. \u201cJust keep the focus up and having my confidence up, I just keep going every day. Working hard.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Though hockey isn\u2019t a popular sport in Italy, Fantin said that didn't deter her.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHockey is not really important for our nation, so it\u2019s always hard to get a chance to play in college and showcase yourself,\u201d Fantin said. \u201cI would just say to my younger self to keep working hard and going with your passion, hockey is the thing I love to do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the games quickly approach, starting on Feb. 5, the freshman is excited about the state of the women\u2019s hockey program at Penn State. The program is home to four total Olympians.</p>\n                <p>Fantin will join two current Penn State teammates, Janecke and Nicole Hall, as the three Nittany Lions represent their respective countries in the games.

The town is no stranger to snow, here\u2019s a look at how large accumulations of snow impacted Penn State over the years through the Collegian\u2019s lens.</p>\n                <p>1951</p>\n                <p>A snowstorm occurred during what many predicted to be a mild winter, based on an old wives tale about the thickness of the stripes on a caterpillar\u2019s back foretelling the severity of the upcoming winter.</p>\n                <p>Despite the tale, State College received over six inches of snow on Dec. 15, 1951, days before the official start of winter on Dec. 21.</p>\n                <p>1960</p>\n                <p>A storm produced ten inches of snow on Feb. 20, 1960, bringing down trees and powerlines. The snow clung with \u201cunusual depth,\u201d according to Collegian archives.</p>\n                <p>State police reported Centre County roads were in \u201cbad shape\u201d by the end of the storm, and many side roads were closed because of drifting snow. The storm was \u201cthe most wide-spread of the winter,\u201d with four reported deaths in Pennsylvania, according to the Collegian reporting.</p>\n                <p>Less than two weeks later, on March 4, the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania saw between eight to 15 inches of snow. Around a foot was recorded in the borough of State College.</p>\n                <p>1961</p>\n                <p>After a record setting 64 inches of snow fall by early February, the university and the borough of State College faced budgetary constraints for snow removal.</p>\n                <p>Penn State set aside $14,000 for snow removal for the entire winter, and spent $19,000 by Feb. 8.</p>\n                <p>1993</p>\n                <p>In 1993 a rare March blizzard blanketed State College as students returned to campus after spring break. Many scrambled for shelter, and hotels filled fast around Pennsylvania as conditions became \u201cimpassable,\u201d according to Collegian reporting.</p>\n                <p>In total, 27.5 inches of snow was recorded between March 12-14, causing the storm to be nicknamed the \u201cStorm of Century\u201d by the State College office of the National Weather Service.</p>\n                <p>1995</p>\n                <p>In 1992, a Nov. 16. snowstorm brought wet, heavy snow to State College, weighing heavily on trees and power lines. An OPP employee described the day as a \u201chazardous situation,\u201d according to Collegian reporting.</p>\n                <p>1999</p>\n                <p>Snow and ice led to the cancellation of classes and CATA Bus services on Jan. 14. Preparations for snow removal operations were laid out by OPP to clear 23 miles of sidewalks and 31 miles of streets on the University Park campus.</p>\n                <p>A couple months later, on March 15, Students returning to State College after spring break ran into winter weather that included five inches of snow which created significant travel impacts with up to a foot of snow in surrounding states.</p>\n                <p>2002</p>\n                <p>The University Weather Service predicted around three inches of snow would greet students upon return for the spring semester on Jan. 7. Instead, 13 inches fell, which was the largest snow storm recorded since 1996, according to Collegian reporting. The weather resulted in a delay of the start of the semester.</p>\n                <p>Essential university personnel were called in as the university was closed due to winter weather in early February. If staff felt unsafe to travel, Penn State encouraged them to stay home; however, they would have to utilize personal or vacation days.</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse will have a change at the goaltending position. Longtime goalie Jack Fracyon has moved on to the PLL, meaning there will be a new goalkeeper in the crease. The same can\u2019t be said for the Nittany Lions in the faceoff circle.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have a few returners and should be more stable than last season.</p>\n                <p>Faceoff Guys</p>\n                <p>A big surprise last season was Colby Baldwin. Baldwin was crucial on the faceoff dot. Baldwin led the team in attempts with 269 and won 156 of those draws for a .580 faceoff win percentage. That was a large increase from his freshman season, where he only had a .379 faceoff winning percentage that first year.</p>\n                <p>The junior also contributed three goals and four assists. The White Plains, New York, native will be crucial in getting the Nittany Lions' possession to start the offense in each game.</p>\n                <p>Competing with Baldwin is Reid Gills. The sophomore took draws after Baldwin got injured. Gills went 79-for-130, which is a .608 faceoff win percentage. There could be some competition between the two, but it\u2019s likely Baldwin will get the start. Gills will be the main backup and will play if Baldwin struggles.</p>\n                <p>Zach Arbuckle rounds out the faceoff guys on the roster. Arbuckle was a three-star recruit according to Inside Lacrosse. He could see the field if an injury were to occur, but it\u2019s expected that he redshirts.</p>\n                <p>Goalies</p>\n                <p>With the loss of Fracyon, Ben Johnson is in line to be the starter. Johnson is also the only goaltender on the roster who has played in a game. The Peoria, Illinois, native has played in five total games, including two from last season, tallying three saves and a .600 save percentage last season.</p>\n                <p>Johnson has a goals against average of 8.00, but only faced a total of eight shots last year. This will be the first time he has a strong chance to have the crease to himself.</p>\n                <p>Preston Hawkins is a potential backup. Hawkins was the 96th best player in the 2025 recruiting class and could be given a chance to flash his skill if the squad is dominating a game.</p>\n                <p>With the lack of playing experience behind Johnson, it seems that Hawkins is the frontrunner to be the backup.</p>\n                <p>The other depth in the cage are Will Mitchell and Hayes Schreiner. Mitchell redshirted last season, and Schreiner hasn\u2019t seen the field in three years with the squad.</p>\n                <p>It seems that both are desperate depth options, but neither is expected to see the field next season.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

Nnodim fills out his 6-foot-2, 290-pound frame well, and could see more growth in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Even in Smith\u2019s section, McPherson and Ezeogu provide size at 6-foot-6, 240 pounds and 6-foot-5, 285 pounds, respectively.</p>\n                <p>McPherson could also become a weapon for special teams coordinator Justin Lustig, as he blocked a punt against Delaware last season.</p>\n                <p>Even on the edge, in comes 6-foot-6 Colorado transfer Alexander McPherson.His highlight play in 2025 was a punt block against Delaware.The six-foot-5 DE Dani Dennis-Sutton notably blocked three punts for Penn State last season <a href=\"https://t.co/U1siPzZO9M\">pic.twitter.com/U1siPzZO9M</a>&mdash; Collegian Football (@psufootblog) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/psufootblog/status/2016334522388771094?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>At 6-foot-5, 290 pounds, Carnell could play both on the interior and on the edge.

Still, with their size being a key factor, they could help a Penn State run defense that was ranked 11th in the Big Ten at 142.3 yards allowed per game.</p>\n                <p>The one that likely boasts the highest expectations in that category going into 2026 is Williams.

He played in new defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn\u2019s UCLA defense in 2023, earning a 73.9 Pro Football Focus run grade in 111 run defense snaps.</p>\n                <p>Vakalahi and Taupaki also naturally slot in as good fits to be two-gappers in Lynn\u2019s scheme. In run situations, throwing either of the two on the inside beside Williams should boast quality results.</p>\n                <p>McPherson finished 21st at Colorado in snaps on run defense, so it'll be interesting to see how much he sees the field in run situations.</p>\n                <p>McPherson easily read his key before running down the line of scrimmage for a run stop on this one.

    "title": "Penn State notebook | Mike Rhoades talks support from administration, insight from Ohio State loss",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After a ninth straight conference loss for Penn State, Mike Rhoades was back in the Bryce Jordan Center media room for his weekly presser Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades spoke on the support he gets from Penn State\u2019s administration in addition to some insight into the defeat to Ohio State on Monday night.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s more of what Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Support from administration</p>\n                <p>Rhoades is in Year 3 of his attempt to build a basketball program at Penn State. There hasn\u2019t been much historical success by the Nittany Lions, with Rhoades often referring that the team has only seen \u201cpockets of success.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades was asked if Penn State\u2019s administration is giving enough support to help him get the program to where he wants it to be.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat's the envelope I got to push all the time, and we're going to fight for that,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThat's what's great about working for (Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics) Pat Kraft is I can have those open conversations with him about where we need to go and where we need to push \u2026 I could walk into Pat's office at any time and sit down and have a kind of candid conversation with him because we all want the same thing. We want to build this program to make it a winner.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are off to a 9-11 start this season, including an 0-9 start to Big Ten play. Last year saw Rhoades\u2019 squad finish 16-15 with six Big Ten wins, which was after a 16-17 record with nine conference regular-season wins during Rhoades\u2019 first campaign with the team in 2023-24.</p>\n                <p>This season, Penn State has the youngest roster in the Big Ten and one of the youngest in the country, according to Rhoades. The Nittany Lions have gone up against more experienced teams across the Big Ten so far through the conference slate.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe culture of college basketball now is to get to get older quicker, and to get bigger and stronger and older quicker, and our league is doing that in a specific way,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThat's something we got to address as we move forward. But that's what's great about Pat is it's not a \u2018No.\u2019 It's \u2018Alright, let's see what we can do,\u2019 and we have some great conversations about it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>What went wrong vs. Ohio State</p>\n                <p>Midway through the first half of Monday\u2019s game, Ohio State went on a 14-2 run to give it a 25-11 advantage over Penn State. The Nittany Lions cut the lead down to 33-23 with 3:55 left in the half, but the Buckeyes managed to gain a 50-32 halftime advantage.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State shot 66.7% from the field and 54.5% from 3-point range during the first half.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're just not a very good defensive team,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIn league play, other teams are shooting 52% (from the field) and 41% from three. That's not winning basketball. That's hard. I do think some of this is youth, some of it is guarding star players who are really good players. We're getting beat, we're getting beat way too much, and then they get going. And we've really struggled letting good players get going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State prevented Ohio State guard Bruce Thornton from generating much as he ended with nine points on 4-of-6 shooting. However, as Rhoades noted, fellow guard John Mobley Jr. went off instead for 25 points with 5-of-11 shooting from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>It was the third consecutive game where the Nittany Lions held a large halftime deficit. Penn State slimmed Ohio State\u2019s lead down to 60-59 in the second half, but it never fully overcame the 18-point hole at halftime as the Buckeyes won, 84-78.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think our defense, our guarding, and the half-court defense, we struggled, just not consistent. I think that's number one. The second thing, and very close to the number one, is when another team goes on a run, instead of having poise, and it starts with me helping these guys understand it, it\u2019s, \u2018I got hit a three. I got to make a play to get us back in it.\u2019 And that makes it a snowball, and it's become a big snowball in some of these games.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Players\u2019 minutes in Ohio State game</p>\n                <p>There were a few lineup choices that stood out during the Ohio State game, such as guard Melih Tunca getting 17 minutes and forward Mason Blackwood only getting four minutes.</p>\n                <p>Tunca played just 16 minutes during the Maryland and Wisconsin games combined, and he has to be more aggressive to see more action, according to Rhoades. Against the Buckeyes, Rhoades said Tunca showcased that, and the Turkey native notched 13 points on 4-of-8 shooting from the field.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought what was promising for Melih yesterday was how hard he tried to play defense and he battled,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThen if you get lost in the game of effort and approach and just being aggressive and flying around, usually your instincts take over. And you saw his instincts on the offensive end take over. We need that.

As a result, Minnesota gives up a conference-low 10.6 turnovers per game, as opposed to Penn State\u2019s conference-high 18.9 turnovers per game.</p>\n                <p>Lineup changes</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s game against Oregon featured a very different starting lineup for the Lady Lions, missing both Kiyomi McMiller and Gracie Merkle.</p>\n                <p>While Merkle went down with what is believed to be a head injury during last week\u2019s game against Washington, McMiller came off the bench for the first time this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the same thing we\u2019ve been doing all year,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cChanging up lineups, changing up starters and trying to find the right fit at the right time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In addition to Merkle\u2019s appearance on the availability report, senior Amiya Evans has been out since Jan. 11, but has a chance to return on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHopefully (Gracie and Amiya) are healthy to play, but obviously concerned about their health first,\u201d Kieger said.</p>\n                <p>Career reflection</p>\n                <p>With Kieger\u2019s seventh season with Penn State winding down, she\u2019s on track for her sixth losing season, with four of the worst losing streaks in school history.</p>\n                <p>This year, the Lady Lions are riding a 0-10 conference record alongside the men\u2019s team\u2019s 0-9 record. Both Kieger and Mike Rhoades have faced immense backlash on the internet over the past few weeks over the legacy they\u2019re leaving behind.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI mean, we approach every game the same,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe approach everything the same, which is giving our all and putting our team in a position to win. We\u2019re going to continue to do that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With eight games left this year, Kieger has a chance to break even or go above .500. Despite the hard path to reach that goal, her squad is continuing to fight for its season with Kieger in the hot seat.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe continue to instill winning habits and make sure that we\u2019re talking about what it takes to succeed in all walks of life,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe want Penn State to win, but we want our women to feel it, and we want them to feel proud of themselves and each other.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Similar to Penn State, there were two dominant victories over the weekend as the rest of the Big Ten saw a series of lopsided-dual matches.</p>\n                <p>However, two duals stood above the rest in competitiveness, headlined by a clash between upcoming opponents for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>BJC Dual preview</p>\n                <p>The most noteworthy contests of the previous weekend came from Penn State\u2019s upcoming dual opponents in the Bryce Jordan Center in Nebraska and Ohio State. The two faced marquee opponents on Friday before clashing with each other in a highlight-reel matchup on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>The Buckeyes started the action on Friday with a 29-9 blowout of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Ohio State won the first five matches en route to taking seven out of 10 matches on the card.</p>\n                <p>Noteworthy matches in the dual included No. 4 Max McEnelly beating No. 5 Dylan Fishback, 4-1, in sudden victory. McEnelly has performed under expectations up to this match after being a favorite in the weight class entering 2025-26, while Fishback has surged up rankings up until his match Friday.</p>\n                <p>Unranked Buckeyes\u2019 125-pounder Vincent Kilkeary upset no. 9 Jore Volk in sudden victory to set the tone. During the ensuing five-match win streak, 141-pound No. 1 Jesse Mendez delivered a 21-5 tech fall over No. 9 Vance Vombaur.</p>\n                <p>Notable news for the Buckeyes is that 157-pound No.1 Brandon Cannon is out with a knee injury, which is expected to keep him out for multiple weeks. He is uncertain to return for their dual with Penn State on Feb. 13.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska, on the other hand, spent their Friday night losing to Iowa at home. Hawkeyes\u2019 coach Tom Brands earned his 300th career win in the 22-14 victory.</p>\n                <p>The victory came behind a couple of upsets by the Hawkeyes. At 133, No. 10 Drake Ayala upset No. 8 Jacob Van Dee, 12-6, and at 184, Gabe Arnold upset No. 7 Silas Allred, 4-1.</p>\n                <p>On Sunday, Nebraska and Ohio State met in Columbus in a dual decided by a single point.</p>\n                <p>The dual started with four straight Buckeye victories, getting Ohio State out to a 14-0 lead. One of those wins saw Mendez get revenge over No. 3 Brock Hardy in a national final rematch. Mendez won 14-3 via major decision.</p>\n                <p>Once the bout reached 157 pounds, Nebraska turned the tides. No. 5 Antrell Taylor\u2019s major decision over Maddox Shaw set off a run of five straight wins to give Nebraska a 16-14 lead with one match to go. Nebraska saw upsets at 174 pounds, with No. 6 Christopher Minto defeating No. 4 Carson Kharchla. At 184-pounds Allred beat Fishback in tiebreakers during the streak.</p>\n                <p>The dual came down to a heavyweight rematch between No. 3 Nick Feldman and No. 4 AJ Ferrari. The match went into sudden victory, where Feldman took down Ferrari to secure Ohio State\u2019s 17-16 win.</p>\n                <p>Rest of conference</p>\n                <p>The rest of the Big Ten saw a smattering of blowouts around the Midwest, with the exception of another one-point swing in Champaign, Illinois. The No. 12 Fighting Illini beat No. 17 Rutgers on a criteria tiebreaker after the matches concluded tied 16-16.</p>\n                <p>The teams traded back-to-back wins for the first four weight classes, before Illinois pulled away slightly, up 13-6. At 174 pounds, Ryan Ford upset No. 25 Colin Kelly with a major decision to bring the Scarlet Knights back into it.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers trailed 16-13 entering the heavyweight bout when No. 19 Hunter Catka took a sudden-victory decision to knot the dual at 16.</p>\n                <p>Illinois was awarded the decisive point on third criteria, which is awarded to the total individual scoring across the 10 matches, where it had a 46-42 edge.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

Good\u2019s death sparked protests in both State College and across the country.</p>\n                <p>Elise Groff, who also participated in the Renee Good protest, said she felt disturbed with Pretti\u2019s death and what it says about the current climate in the United States.</p>\n                <p>\u201dICE killed a man in Minneapolis and the government's lying about that,\u201d Groff, a fourth-year studying chemistry, said. \u201cI'm surprised there aren't more people out here.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Groff said she hoped the vigil and protest would give Pretti\u2019s family comfort by showing they are not alone in grieving for their loss, and that the protest would help spread further awareness to others who may not be well-informed about his death.</p>\n                <p>The vigil began at 7 p.m. and saw hundreds of protestors lead through chants of \u201cSay his name: Alex Pretti,\u201d \u201cSay her name: Renee Good\u201d and \u201cFuera La Migra (ICE out).\u201d</p>\n                <p>During the protest, a red car attempted to drive through the crowd at the Allen Street light with a protester jumping onto the vehicle and punching the windshield before the car drove away.</p>\n                <p>Carter Davis said he was appalled by attempts from the federal government to cover up the details surrounding Pretti\u2019s death.</p>\n                <p>State College police said no reports have been made about any incidents from the protest.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like everyone here saw what happened in Minneapolis, which is kind of pretty clear,\u201d Davis, a second-year studying secondary education, said. \u201cIt's just not right.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Davis said he believes change must happen soon in order to prevent further bloodshed.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'd like to hope that someone's listening but if they're not listening, we can at least try to be heard by being loud and outspoken,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI hope we should start to get people's attention so that they start thinking critically about what's going on and just stir up some sort of action. Maybe you can get more people to just come to the protests and just speak out against what's going on, just cause it's terrible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Protestors were guided to march from Old Main and into downtown State College, holding signs that said \u201cDrive out ICE,\u201d \u201cI prefer my ICE crushed\u201d and \u201cMake racists afraid again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The march ended at Old Main at 8:15 p.m. with organizers from the SCDS and People's Defense Front urging those in attendance to sign up for neighborhood patrols and continue coming together to hold future events.</p>\n                <p>An SCDS spokesperson, who requested anonymity for fear of their personal safety, said they hoped the protest\u2019s message would reverberate across multiple channels and ways.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'm hoping that people in Minneapolis see that people in a relatively small rural part of Pennsylvania stand with them,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cI'm hoping that Penn State sees what students want, what the community wants, and doesn't allow ICE to come on campus, doesn't revoke student visas, and I'm hoping that ICE sees this and knows that people are gonna take action if they plan to come here and we're prepared.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Elliott Inscho | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s been a rough season for Penn State women\u2019s basketball, and the struggle continued when the Lady Lions took on Oregon and No. 25 Washington last week.</p>\n                <p>The team\u2019s road trip to the Pacific Northwest saw the blue and white remain winless in Big Ten play, losing by a combined 46 points to the former Pac-12 foes.</p>\n                <p>After the two losses, the Lady Lions are 7-14 on the season, and in the midst of a ten-game losing streak. They\u2019ve won just one of their last 14 games, that victory coming over VCU on Dec. 20.</p>\n                <p>Shooting inefficiency</p>\n                <p>While Penn State went a relatively acceptable 40.6% from the field in the two losses, several key players had poor shooting performances that contributed to the failing efforts.</p>\n                <p>Against Washington, guard Kiyomi McMiller shot 5-for-17 from the field and 28.6% from inside the arc. Fellow guard T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante also struggled, posting a 36.4% shooting percentage and going just 20% from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>Cl\u00e8ante\u2019s poor shooting continued against Oregon, as the French freshman shot 16.7% overall and 0-for-4 from deep.</p>\n                <p>Shaelyn Steele and Vitoria Santana each went 2-for-7 from the field against Oregon, contributing to a team shooting percentage of 39%. With the Ducks shooting a far more efficient 57%, it would\u2019ve been a tall task for the Lady Lions to come out on top.</p>\n                <p>If Penn State is going to pick up a Big Ten victory by season\u2019s end, it will need to find better shooting form, particularly from its star players.</p>\n                <p>Charity stripe challenges</p>\n                <p>In the matchups with Washington and Oregon, the Lady Lions struggled mightily when they found themselves at the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>Against Washington, Penn State went 3-for-9 from the line, while the Huskies shot 12-for-15. Washington got more opportunities, but being outshot by nearly 50 percentage points at the free throw line is generally not congruent with victory.</p>\n                <p>The same theme held true against Oregon, where the Lady Lions shot 50% from the charity stripe in comparison to the Ducks\u2019 85%.</p>\n                <p>Making more free throws wouldn\u2019t have made up the 30 point deficit that Penn State lost by, but poor free throw shooting has been a common theme throughout the season. Through 21 games, the Lady Lions are shooting a combined 65.3% at the line, a rate that ranks last in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Still searching for Big Ten success</p>\n                <p>Last season, coach Carolyn Kieger and the Lady Lions won just a single conference game, and they\u2019re on pace to come up short of that mark this year.</p>\n                <p>Last week saw the Big Ten struggles get even worse, with the loss to Oregon marking the third time the Lady Lions lost by 30 or more points this year. A 36-point deficit to UCLA and a 40-point dismantling by Michigan earlier in the season slotted the loss to the Ducks as the third-worst of the season.</p>\n                <p>Under Kieger, the blue and white posted two seasons with just a single conference win. One came last year, and the other was her debut campaign as Penn State\u2019s head coach.</p>\n                <p>While the conference slate has been ugly so far, there\u2019s ample opportunity to get an elusive Big Ten victory. There are still two ranked teams left to play, No. 13 Michigan State and No. 15 Maryland, but there are easier games to follow.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions still have to play Northwestern, Rutgers and Indiana, which rank No. 15, No. 16 and No. 17 in the Big Ten, respectively. Coming in the final weeks of the season, those matchups will be the best opportunity for Kieger and Penn State to get on the board in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s basketball suffered two double-digit losses in its West Coast trip to Washington and Oregon last week, falling to 7-14 on the season. The Lady Lions are still searching for their first Big Ten win since Jan. 19, 2025.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have eight games left this season to find its footing and earn a conference victory, starting with a battle against Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Tipoff is set for 6 p.m. Wednesday in Rec Hall, and the meeting with the Golden Gophers is Penn State\u2019s National Girls and Women in Sports Day game.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota is 14-6, with its win column highlighted by a victory over then-No. 21 USC, while suffering close losses to then-No. 7 Maryland and then-No. 9 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>In the Gophers\u2019 most recent outing, they convincingly defeated Wisconsin 88-53. Sophomore guard Tori McKinney was the game's leading scorer with 20 points. The Minnetonka, Minnesota, native is the team's second-highest scorer this season, averaging 12.5 points per game.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions\u2019 last game against Oregon was a tale of two halves. After trailing 40-34 at halftime, the blue and white fell 89-59. Freshman Nyla McFadden and sophomore Kiyomi McMiller each scored a team-high 15 points.</p>\n                <p>Penn State played without 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle after suffering a head injury in the previous game against Washington. Merkle is the Lady Lions\u2019 leading scorer at 19.3 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota\u2019s scoring effort is led by 5-foot-10 junior guard Grace Grocholski, who averages 14 points per game and is a top shooter in the Big Ten with 2.6 made three pointers per game. The North Prairie, Wisconsin, native enters Wednesday's matchup after an 18-point performance in which she shot 6-for-7 from field-goal range and 4-for-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n                <p>The Gophers present tough guard play thanks to the likes of Grocholski and McKinney; the Lady Lions will look for a strong outing from their backcourt, which is led by McMiller and redshirt junior Moriah Murray.</p>\n                <p>McMiller is the blue and white's second leading scorer, averaging 18.8 points per game. Murray averages 9.5 points per game, and matches Grocholski\u2019s scoring from deep by also netting 2.6 three pointers per contest.</p>\n                <p>Both teams own a nearly similar total points per game average, with Penn State averaging 74.4 points, compared to Minnesota\u2019s 74.2. The bigger outlier between the two opponents comes from the defensive side of the ball.</p>\n                <p>Statistically, the Gophers have the best defense in the Big Ten, allowing just 54.2 points per game, and this number also ranks in the top-10 nationally.</p>\n                <p>On the other hand, the Lady Lions have the conference\u2019s worst defense, with opponents averaging 82.3 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Wednesday\u2019s matchup presents Penn State with both a clear challenge and an opportunity. If the Lady Lions can generate consistent offense from their guards while tightening up defensively, they\u2019ll give themselves a chance to crack Minnesota\u2019s elite defense and potentially break through in conference play.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Four of the five wrestlers placed at the invitational.</p>\n                <p>Hayden Cunningham was the first to wrestle for the Nittany Lions. Cunningham wrestled at 141 pounds and had an overall record of 2-2 for the weekend. The redshirt freshman registered a major-decision victory and placed fourth.</p>\n                <p>At 149, Dalton Perry competed for Penn State, recovering from his knee injury that he suffered at the Army Black Knight Invitational in November. The freshman went 2-1 with a major decision-victory and placed second.</p>\n                <p>At 174, the Nittany Lions had two wrestlers compete in Sam Beckett and Sean Degl. Degl went 2-2 and had a rougher outing than Beckett. Beckett also went 2-2, but had a tech-fall victory and placed fourth in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Rounding it out at 285 pounds, Dawson Bundy wrestled the most out of any of the other Penn State competitors. Bundy went 2-0 in collegiate matches and 1-2 in non-collegiate matches. The redshirt freshman also had a tech-fall victory and placed fourth.</p>\n                <p>Transfers</p>\n                <p>Oklahoma State was supposed to have two matches last weekend, but the match against Utah Valley got postponed. That match could\u2019ve contained three former Nittany Lions, with 149-pounder David Evans being on Utah Valley, but the Cowboys only had their match against Missouri. Oklahoma State defeated Missouri 33-3.</p>\n                <p>Of the Oklahoma State contingent who were in action, No. 7 Alex Facundo at 174 pounds wrestled a former All-American in No. 10 Cam Steed. The match was tight, but Facundo got the better of Steed, defeating him 2-1. Facundo now has four-ranked wins with his last two being Steed and No. 8 Carter Schubert of Oklahoma.</p>\n                <p>At 184 Pounds, No. 8 Zack Ryder continues to struggle against wrestlers ranked higher than him. The Cowboy dropped his match, 4-1, after No. 3 Aeoden Sinclair got a takedown in the later parts of the third period. That is Ryder\u2019s fifth loss of the season.</p>\n                <p>Jack Kelly got some action for George Mason against Edinboro. Kelly bumped up from 184 to 197 in this one, and it didn\u2019t go in his favor.

Senior Hannah Stuelke led with 22 points against the Spartans, sophomore Ava Heiden dropped 20 against the Terrapins, and freshman Addie Deal scored a team-high 20 points against the Buckeyes on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Purdue earns 2nd Big Ten win over conference winless Indiana</p>\n                <p>The lowest tier of the Big Ten continued to separate from the rest after another week of action.</p>\n                <p>The biggest reason for this came in Purdue\u2019s second conference win of the season, a victory over an 11-9 Indiana despite a 42.6% chance of winning.</p>\n                <p>While the Boilermakers haven\u2019t yet established a true leading scorer, they had three athletes in double figures, with another four players just one basket away from double-digit scoring.</p>\n                <p>For the Hoosiers, however, former Penn State star Shay Ciezki led the way in scoring.

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>As coach Jeff Kampersal made his way back from a European hockey camp, he knew Jessica Adolfsson had the potential to be a great Penn State athlete. Little did he know she would make it to the Olympics and represent her country twice.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBelieve in the process and be patient with yourself,\u201d Adolfsson told The Daily Collegian. \u201cSurround yourself with people who support you, and don\u2019t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone. If you\u2019re willing to work consistently and stay passionate, those dreams are possible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With those goals and that mindset, Adolfsson earned her spot in the 2022 and 2026 Olympics to represent Sweden in women\u2019s ice hockey.</p>\n                <p>While Kampersal knew she would be a star in the future, many of Adolfsson\u2019s teammates saw that skillset in her when she joined the Nittany Lions in 2018.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJess had a very clear standard for herself and for how she showed up every day,\u201d Chantal Burke, a former teammate of Adolfsson, told the Collegian. \u201cShe was consistent, driven and quietly confident. On the ice, she played with purpose. That combination of internal motivation, self-awareness and work ethic is what made it easy to believe she could reach the Olympic level.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After playing a limited role in the first two games of the season, Adolfsson had a huge effort on Oct. 5, 2018, against Merrimack, when she recorded her first assist after five shots.</p>\n                <p>A few weeks later, she earned her first goal on a last-minute power play against Robert Morris and tallied her first multi-point game against Cornell.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJessica just had a lot of presence as a (defender), good stature, a really good skater, really good puck mover and a cannon for a shot,\u201d Kampersal told the Collegian. \u201cShe came to Penn State and hit the ground running with no issues whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Adolfsson\u2019s quick success was made evident on the ice, but her teammates and coaches saw her success in the locker room becoming even more prevalent.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the locker room, she brought sincerity and accountability,\u201d Burke said. \u201cShe shared pieces of herself in genuine moments and wasn\u2019t afraid to connect on a deeper level, which built trust and brought the team closer together.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After scoring two goals and five assists through the first few months of action, Adolfsson finished the season on a hot streak with three goals and two assists through February and the first week of March.</p>\n                <p>Adolfsson\u2019s freshman success was evident following her postseason awards, being named to the CHA All-Rookie team after ranking third among CHA freshmen defenders in scoring.</p>\n                <p>In just her second season with the Nittany Lions, Adolfsson was named an alternate captain before ultimately sustaining a season-ending injury just five weeks into the season. During this time, Adolfsson\u2019s interactions with her team became more important as her efforts weren\u2019t possible on the ice.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Jessica) loved poetry and learning, and she would genuinely share what she was studying or thinking about with me,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThose moments showed a depth to her that people might not have seen from the stands. She was very intentional with her words and her actions, and you could tell she knew what she wanted from herself and from her team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>What she wanted was on display when she came back from injury, playing in all 21 games of the season after she returned on Nov. 29, 2020.</p>\n                <p>In the following game, Adolfsson returned to her peak form with a goal from the defensive end. A little over a month later, she had the only two-goal game of her career against Robert Morris, as she tallied four goals and seven assists on the season.</p>\n                <p>Adolfsson ultimately departed from Penn State after just three years, as she joined Link\u00f6ping HC in the Swedish Women\u2019s Hockey League.</p>\n                <p>Despite cutting her collegiate career short, the Link\u00f6ping, Sweden, native made her mark on Happy Valley, both on the ice and off.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn my opinion, her greatest legacy is bringing that sort of professional approach to the team culture and commitment,\u201d Kampersal said.</p>\n                <p>After combining for just 23 points in her two seasons in the SWHL before joining Penn State, Adolfsson scored 25 points off 6 goals and 19 assists in her first year back in 2021.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPenn State prepared me tremendously,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cThe experience I gained at PSU taught me how to be consistent, handle pressure and elevate my game in big moments.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The biggest moment of her career came just a year after leaving Penn State, as she was named to represent the Swedish women\u2019s hockey team at the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIt felt like one of those moments where you think, \u2018This just makes sense.\u2019 Seeing her make her first Olympic team in 2022 is a testament to her growth, resilience and commitment to her passion for hockey.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Adolfsson prepared for the big game, she adapted her collegiate training style from the typical six-month season she had previously experienced to a new two-and-a-half week Olympic tournament.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe preparation has been very detailed and intentional,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cThere\u2019s more emphasis on short-term performance, international systems and team chemistry in a condensed time frame. It\u2019s different from a long college season, but the focus and intensity are extremely high.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sweden opened the 2022 Olympic Games with two 3-1 losses to Japan and Czechia before earning a 2-1 win against China and a 3-1 win against Denmark.</p>\n                <p>While Adolfsson and Sweden ultimately lost 11-0 in the quarterfinals to Canada, finishing eighth overall, she strongly cherished the moment representing her country.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWearing Sweden\u2019s jersey is something I never take for granted,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cIt represents playing for everyone back home and honoring our hockey tradition and competing with heart every time I step on the ice.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After another year of action with Link\u00f6ping HC, Adolfsson moved to HV71 of the SDHL before moving across the Atlantic to the Ottawa Charge of the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League. She only played one game in Canada before returning home to Sweden to join SDE HF in the SDHL.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt makes me incredibly proud of her, especially as someone who understands all the highs and lows, blood, sweat and tears that are unavoidable through the trajectory of a unique hockey career,\u201d Burke said.</p>\n                <p>Over the past month, Adolfsson was named one of four Penn State athletes to represent her country at the 2026 Olympic Games, marking her second appearance at the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPenn State is developing players who can compete at the highest level, and seeing that reflected on the international stage speaks to the coaching, culture and commitment within the program,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cSharing that experience with Nicole (Hall) makes it even better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Adolfsson enters the Olympics at 27 years old, Kampersal hopes she can make the most of her experience later in her career.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m super excited because she\u2019s getting on with her career,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThese opportunities are very few and come every four years, so I\u2019m super excited and proud of her to represent Team Sweden in Italy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After an eighth-place finish in her first Olympic Games, Adolfsson doesn\u2019t have an exact placement in mind ahead of 2026, but is hoping for success with her team.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe believe in our group and our preparation,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cOur expectation is to compete hard every game, play our style of hockey and continue to grow throughout the tournament. If we stay connected and committed, we believe we can do something special.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Elliott Inscho | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After coming two goals short of a national championship appearance last season, Penn State has a shot at another strong campaign in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Last year saw the Nittany Lions go 12-5, with wins over No. 10 Notre Dame, No. 13 Michigan and eventual national champion No. 3 Cornell, though the Big Red would end the blue and white\u2019s season in the NCAA semifinals.</p>\n                <p>This season, the Nittany Lions are ranked No. 7 in the season-opening Inside Lacrosse rankings. While the blue and white are a well-rounded group, a few players could help push that ranking higher with strong seasons.</p>\n                <p>Hunter Aquino</p>\n                <p>Aquino made a quick name for himself in 2025, being named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year following a 16-goal debut season. The 6-foot-5 midfielder\u2019s 37 total points ranked second on the team, behind only Matt Traynor.</p>\n                <p>With Traynor graduating following last season, Aquino is likely to step into an even larger role in 2026. The Easton, Pennsylvania, native got first-line reps last year, but with Traynor gone, he\u2019ll be the clear-cut first option midfielder for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>After being named a second-team All-American by Inside Lacrosse as a freshman, an offseason of development and increased workload could make for an even larger breakout by Aquino this season.</p>\n                <p>Alex Ross</p>\n                <p>Ross was named to the All-Big Ten Second Team and an Inside Lacrosse All-American Honorable Mention in 2025. To start 2026, he\u2019s been named as a Big Ten Player to Watch alongside Aquino and defensive midfielder Jon King.</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-1 senior caused 15 turnovers in 2025, a mark that ranked second-most by any Nittany Lion. Similar to Aquino, Ross will see an increased role with the departure of Kevin Parnham, and is likely to take on the most challenging attack matchups in each game.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defense allowed a solid 9.4 goals per game last season, a mark that ranked No. 14 in the nation, and Ross was a major factor in that strong performance. The unit will be shaken up a bit in 2026, but the Davidsonville, Maryland, native is likely to have another strong season.</p>\n                <p>Liam Matthews</p>\n                <p>The redshirt sophomore scored 28 goals last season, second-most on the team, trailing only the aforementioned Traynor. The Orangeville, Ontario, native\u2019s 34 total points ranked fourth-most, and second among returning players.</p>\n                <p>Matthews\u2019 scoring total came on a 40% shooting percentage, which led all Nittany Lions who took more than four shots last season. That efficiency will be valued on an offensive unit that needs to replace a lot of production with Traynor\u2019s departure.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white scored 12.3 goals per game last season, ranking No. 21 nationally. Matthews and the rest of the attack unit are poised to improve on that mark in 2026.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

They\u2019re the ties that bind us together.</p>\n                <p>Otherwise, we\u2019re just a bunch of randos forced together by happenstance.</p>\n                <p>If you\u2019ve ever met someone who went to your high school, before or after your attendance, you probably asked them a series of questions related to your own personal experiences.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDid you have XYZ teacher that everybody hated?\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cDid you also go to PQR event that was the biggest of the year when I went there?\u201d</p>\n                <p>If their answers were no, the conversation probably fizzled out pretty quickly.

Though not at the same time, nor with the same people, you had the same experiences.</p>\n                <p>Traditions transcend time.</p>\n                <p>Observances from the past are often demonized today. It\u2019s said that traditions, experiments that worked, are often monolithically labeled as outdated, oppressive or unfair.</p>\n                <p>But what if most traditions are positive social integrators that mark time and place?</p>\n                <p>I\u2019d bet we could all agree that most rituals are not the demons we make them out to be.</p>\n                <p>For example, Penn State used to have class dances. There was the Soph Hop, the Junior Prom, and the Senior Ball.</p>\n                <p>Now, maybe these disappeared due to class sizes and space constraints, but how much fun would a class-wide university dance function be? There\u2019d be a King and Queen and all sorts of fun aspects.</p>\n                <p>These dances, though just a minor example, are full of symbology. They marked the experience of getting older each year and enjoying social settings with our peers. There\u2019s nothing unfair or oppressive about it.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Penn State used to have all sorts of annual competitions and exhibitions.</p>\n                <p>For example, there used to be an annual All-College Circus in Rec Hall where outstanding members of student orgs were presented to their peers and applauded for their meaningful contributions.</p>\n                <p>We had an annual livestock exhibition held by a club, complete with a co-ed pig race and a meat auction \u2014 a representation of our agricultural roots. This tradition began in 1916 with the last mention of it in The Daily Collegian in 1992 \u2014 its 75th anniversary.</p>\n                <p>Take a walk down memory lane with Penn State\u2019s archives, and you\u2019ll see a plethora of examples like these. But what happened to them? Where are all of our traditions now?</p>\n                <p>We have the White Out and Homecoming. What else?</p>\n                <p>Where are all of the silly traditions, the formal collegiate experiences, the collective activities marking a moment in time, or the uniqueness of a certain place?</p>\n                <p>Why have the past and the events from it been so collectively demonized?</p>\n                <p>Some say modernity is always a positive \u2014 a marker of moving forward. But when we move forward, do we have to leave everything behind? Can\u2019t we mix our modern day and age with the glories of the past, the experiments that worked?</p>\n                <p>Maybe, just maybe, traditions don\u2019t deserve to be constantly castigated and relegated to the dustbins of history.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad dropped to 9-11 on the year and 0-9 in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened the second half on a 27-10 run, cutting Ohio State\u2019s lead down to 60-59 after an and-1 jumper by forward Josh Reed with 10:46 left in the game. The Nittany Lions were consistently threatening the lead early in the second half with wing Eli Rice slimming it down to 58-54 at the 11:57 mark.</p>\n                <p>But as Penn State came close to taking its first lead of the game, the Buckeyes went on a quick 5-0 run behind two free throws and a 3-pointer by guard John Mobley Jr., guiding his squad to a 69-61 advantage. The two squads battled, but Mobley got Ohio State back to a double-digit cushion with another 3-pointer to make it a 74-63 game with 6:38 left.</p>\n                <p>Guard Melih Tunca made multiple baskets down the stretch to keep Penn State in it, and Rice brought the Nittany Lions down 80-76 after a 3-pointer with 23 seconds left. However, it wasn\u2019t enough to fully complete a comeback after late free throws by Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>It was the third-straight game Penn State was losing by 18 points or more at halftime as the Buckeyes led 50-32 at the break. Despite entering the game averaging only 9.1 turnovers per game, the Nittany Lions had 10 turnovers in the first half and only shot 41% from the field.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State, on the other hand, shot 66.7% from the field and 54.5% from 3-point range during the first half. The Buckeyes mounted a 14-2 run midway through the half, and even while Penn State cut the lead to 10 points, they temporarily stopped any comeback from happening with a 12-4 run near the end of the half.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 offense was led by Rice, who totaled a team-high 20 points. Seven-footer Ivan Juri\u0107, Tunca and Reed were all in double figures as well, with the team shooting 50% from the field, 40% from 3-point range and 86% at the stripe.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 registered a double-double with 14 rebounds as well, winning the rebound battle for Penn State, 31 to 21.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State had three players in double figures: Mobley, forward Devin Royal and forward Amare Bynum. Mobley paced the Buckeyes with 25 points, and Ohio State shot 56% from the field, 34.8% from 3-point range and 76.2% at the free-throw line.</p>\n                <p>Monday\u2019s game also saw former Penn State player Puff Johnson in action for Ohio State.

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will need to have guys step up at the attack position after losing some key pieces in Matt Traynor and Will Peden. The squad also lost key point-getters in Jack Aimone and Ethan Long.</p>\n                <p>Traynor was selected No. 6 overall by the New York Atlas and impressed in his rookie season. Despite the blue and white losing some key contributors, there are a ton of names who could step up this season.</p>\n                <p>Kyle Lehman and Hunter Aquino are expected to be key pieces as attackers.</p>\n                <p>Lehman saw much more time in his sophomore season than he did in his rookie season, and the growth showed. He had a career high in goals with 26 and points with 33. With Lehman being one of the main ball handlers, he\u2019ll be able to spread the ball around more. The junior improved his shot last season and will look to add more assists to the stat sheet.</p>\n                <p>Aquino will now play attack after being a midfielder last season. The Big Ten Freshman of the Year impressed in his first season. Aquino only started nine games but tallied 37 points, including 21 assists. The sophomore had an injury that forced him to slow down during the NCAA Tournament, but the Easton, Pennsylvania native will be focused on potting in points in his first year as an attackman.</p>\n                <p>Liam Matthews became an important piece during the second half of the season. Despite only starting seven games, Matthews was second on the team in goals with 28. He had the highlight of two behind-the-back goals against Cornell and is expected to have more highlights this season.</p>\n                <p>The depth beyond these three attackmen is thin and unknown. The only player to appear in a collegiate game is Wesley Scurci, who played in two games last season and in 12 games for Lindenwood in 2022-23. The redshirt junior didn\u2019t have any points for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Jack Iannantunono was ranked as the No. 60 player in the 2025 class, according to Inside Lacrosse. The freshman could be a rotation piece at attack this season for the blue and white, considering the lack of experience at depth.</p>\n                <p>Matthew Beachley could be another name to watch. The freshman is in a similar situation to Iannantunono. He could start as a rotational piece and work his way up the depth chart. Beachley is not as highly ranked as Iannantunono, but was still rated as a four-star prospect and has potential.</p>\n                <p>Enzo Grieco redshirted last season and is likely at the bottom of the depth chart, while Matthew Beachley could redshirt this season.</p>\n                <p>The attack show will run through Matthews and Aquino, who\u2019ll likely score a majority of the points for the Nittany Lions in 2026.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Penn State sues major healthcare companies over alleged insulin price manipulation",
    "author": "Taylor McGillvray | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State filed a lawsuit against several major healthcare companies on Jan. 13 alleging that they intentionally increased insulin prices. The university claims the price hikes forced its self-funded healthcare system, which covers staff, faculty, retirees and their dependents, to pay artificially high costs for diabetes medications.</p>\n                <p>The average cost of some diabetes medication has risen more than ten times the amount average consumer goods and services have over the past two decades, according to court documents. The lawsuit alleges that the price increase is not a result of market-driven variables, but the medication was instead engineered by the companies in a way that would increase their profit.</p>\n                <p>Manufacturing defendants Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk allegedly raised prices on purpose to maximize their profit margins within a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d rebate system. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx, along with their parent companies Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealthcare, allegedly created the financial incentives that increased the price.</p>\n                <p>The companies are being sued for fraudulent concealment, violating Pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment.</p>\n                <p>Insulin prices have been quickly increasing over the last twenty years, however, the process of manufacturing the drug has decreased, according to court documents. In 1990, a vial cost as little as $2 to produce, and was priced at $20. Now, the same vials range anywhere from $300 to over $700. The relevant period for the alleged claims is 2008 through the present.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 continuous contacts and conduct within the Commonwealth established a strong nexus among defendants, this forum and the claims at issue, making the exercise of jurisdiction proper and fair.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 listed above were active in Pennsylvania, and their actions directly impacted residents, so the case is to be handled by a court and a requested jury.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 listed above were actively selling insulin in Pennsylvania, and their actions directly impacted residents, including those at the Pennsylvania State University. Penn State demands trial by jury on all issues that are triable.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is seeking restitution and damages, among other legal and equitable monetary remedies available under the state laws.</p>\n                <p>The university declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.</p>\n                <p>MORE CRIME AND COURTS COVERAGE</p>",

The captain totaled 13 points on eight goals and five assists during her streak.</p>\n                <p>Christian and Vaslet each accumulated three points over the two games.

The three skaters combined for six points, with each tallying a goal and an assist.</p>\n                <p>Outwater opened the scoring with Keller notching an assist. With under three minutes remaining in the second period, Christian assisted on a Keller goal to give Penn State a 3-0 lead.

    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly integrated into everyday life with virtually every Google search conducted today coming with AI overviews and access to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek not being far behind.</p>\n                <p>Stuart Selber, a professor of English and director of the Program of Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) in the College of Liberal Arts, said academic integrity cases involving AI usage are often \u201cblack-and-white\u201d due to representing a blatant cheating attempt.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe do have people just treating AI like an answering machine, feeding the assignment sheet in and asking for a finished assignment and handing it in,\u201d Selber said.</p>\n                <p>He said there are various AI usage policies across the different academic colleges and that allows professors to make their own decisions regarding how AI can be used in their classroom.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI might have a teacher who teaches in the writing program who wants to ban AI, that's up to them,\u201d Selber said. \u201cI don't think that's a good idea, myself, because I think we should wrestle with it because we're trying to prepare you to wrestle with it in the workplace so we need to wrestle with it in the classroom.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ibukun Osunbunmi, an assistant research professor in the College of Engineering, said it was important for professors to be transparent with their AI usage policies and believed such discussions would cause a reduction in academic integrity violations.</p>\n                <p>When advising a colleague about how AI can be used in their course, Osunbunmi said it was important for students to first learn lesson materials without AI before they are given access to it, as a way to assist in solving complex problems.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI told him one of my mantras that \u2018If you cannot do it without AI, there's no (way) you can verify AI output,\u2019\u201d Osunbunmi, an assessment and instructional support specialist within the Leonhard Center for Enhancement of Engineering Education, said. \u201cI said \u2018Now that your students have mastered the fundamentals, now they know that AI can go wrong. They'll be careful not to use it or, even if they use it, they will check it and they have done it in a safe space where they are being guided.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>Osunbunmi said he\u2019s currently working on a website resource for Penn State faculty to learn about how AI can be used in their courses. He said there needs to be more accessible resources and frequent discussion on how to effectively use AI in higher education.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhy there's some pushback to AI integration is because it's disrupting how we teach, it\u2019s disrupting how we learn,\u201d Osunbumni said. \u201cUltimately, it has a lot of potentials for use but the outcome will be based on deliberate, inflectional design and I perceive it's going to be a collection of people sitting together in a room and having these hardcore conversations.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mark Morrisson said he and several of his colleagues are currently investigating how to broaden the ways students can leverage AI through a Bachelor of Arts to complement existing Bachelor of Science degrees already being taught in the Colleges of Engineering and Information Science and Technology (IST).</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe engineering one is about how to make AI, how to understand AI, and the IST one is more use apps, things like that, but what we wanted to achieve with a BA was thinking more about ethical, social, cultural implications of emerging technologies,\u201d Morrisson, a professor of English, said. \u201cLiberal art students fit this kind of thinking very, very well and so we wanted something that would draw students \u2026 to be thinking more capaciously about how to understand impacts and dynamics of emerging technologies.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said Penn State stands to benefit from providing ways to increase AI literacy among students.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere is a lot of disruption going on right now over AI and there's the kind of Luddite perspective of \u2018Let's just rewind and not use this,\u2019\u201d Morrisson said. \u201cWell, it's not possible to do that anymore so instead, whether just uncritically consuming it or hoping it'll just go away, there's a middle ground which is understanding it and really thinking it through like we do with all education at Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>David Fusco said he instructs his students to use AI as a tool to help them rather than a crutch to rely on.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the world of technology that most of my students end up going into, people are using AI in their technology-based jobs,\u201d Fusco, an associate teaching professor in the College of Information Science and Technology, said. \u201cFrom my own personal experience and the courses I teach, I think it's a disservice to students to not understand how to use AI properly.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said he thinks it important that students learn how to effectively use AI due to it becoming an increasingly necessary skill in several industries.</p>\n                <p>Gregg Rogers, an associate teaching professor of English and PWR\u2019s associate director, said Penn State has a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to teach students about AI so they are both provided with a useful skill and inspired to pursue new ways in which the technology can be applied.</p>\n                <p>He said changes in Penn State\u2019s stances toward AI in recent years is the result of beginning to consider how to overcome its drawbacks \u2014 such as hallucinations, where LLMs generate faulty outputs \u2014 as well as its potential for misuse.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNone of these problems are going to be solved by not looking at it,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWe are all still learning about this thing which is what we're supposed to be doing \u2014 we're a university.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS CONTENT</p>",

The trailer of the movie suggests the film will frame the story as an erotic romance rather than focusing on the intensity, obsession, and at times cruelty that\u2019s present in Emily Bronte\u2019s novel.</p>\n                <p>Even the film\u2019s depiction of Heathcliff based on the casting choice, seems to directly contrast with the descriptions established within the book.</p>\n                <p>Evidently, book-to-movie adaptations can be difficult. But if the base story already exists, why is it so hard to produce a good adaptation?</p>\n                <p>I think, primarily, it lies within the film industry\u2019s fondness for capitalizing on stories that already exist. A recent survey revealed 63% of Americans are more likely to see a movie if it was based on a successful book, according to People Magazine. Basically, these adaptations are an easy way to make money, because people are familiar with the name.</p>\n                <p>With a well-known name comes expectations surrounding the film. People are going to want to see the characters in the world that has been described to them. However, creative control (and perhaps some arrogance as well) can end up steering the project further and further away from its origins, in an attempt at making the film something more palatable for the screen.</p>\n                <p>For those who aren\u2019t familiar with the original, it doesn\u2019t make much difference. But for those who are familiar, they end up feeling disappointed, repeating their mantra of \u201cthe book was better\u201d on the way out of the theater.</p>\n                <p>Time constraints don\u2019t help either. Generally speaking, the average book is around 200-400 pages, which is difficult to try and fit into a two-hour time frame. This leads to important plot lines being cut, leaving viewers feeling like something is missing.</p>\n                <p>This issue is probably why we\u2019re seeing more books turn into TV shows, which can sometimes be a better alternative to film, as there\u2019s more room to go in-depth into the story.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps these films shouldn\u2019t be solely looked at as \u201cadaptations.\u201d Yes, they are being adapted to fit the screen format. However, they are more of a translation of the source into TV shows or movies. Like any translation, there are versions that translate well and some that don\u2019t, but regardless of whether or not it\u2019s translated well, something will get lost in the process.</p>\n                <p>Tone and nuance are things that can be left omitted, leaving the material unlike the original and not quite right. Even if you read a book that was translated from a different language, it still wouldn\u2019t be exactly the same as the original because there\u2019s no such thing as an exact translation. This is the same for a book to movie adaptations as it\u2019s being translated from one language (literature) into another (film).</p>\n                <p>I caution filmmakers \u2014 because I know they are avid readers of my column \u2014 that, in order to make an adaptation, one must have an incredible familiarity with the source text. While no adaptation is 100% perfect, it could be close if there\u2019s an awareness, understanding and reverence of the book it comes from.</p>\n                <p>While some people aren\u2019t sticklers about every detail being exactly how it\u2019s written, if trying to equate a movie with the book it came from, then the adaptation should be as faithful as possible. If the source material is altered significantly in terms of plot, characters and setting then it shouldn\u2019t attempt to be passed off as a direct version of its origin.</p>\n                <p>While I do love both film and literature, I think their interaction with one another should be much more limited than we have seen and continue to see. Because honestly, how many film versions of one book do we need?</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Things haven\u2019t been great in Happy Valley recently, as Penn State endured a cold stretch fitting in magnitude to the nearly two feet of snow that hit the region.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions face Ohio State on Monday, with a whole emphasis on the athletic portion of their student-athlete duties. With both schools canceling classes, the contest against the Buckeyes seems as essential as ever, despite the rivalry implications.</p>\n                <p>Penn State dropped its last six and sits as one of two winless teams in the Big Ten, but the blue and white hit the road to Columbus with a chance to heat up along the way.</p>\n                <p>By the numbers</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and Ohio State excelled in certain areas of play but also have their shortcomings, and they are actually similar in many of those metrics. Obviously, the 13-6 Buckeyes outperform the 9-10 Nittany Lions heavily across most categories, scoring offense, team defense, rebounding and scoring efficiency inside the arc.</p>\n                <p>Despite these stats suggesting Ohio State cruises to victory due to those fundamental advantages, there are also intangibles where Penn State actually holds surprising favorability.</p>\n                <p>Beyond the arc, both are mediocre, if even that, shooters, and have comparable possession and assist averages.</p>\n                <p>Building on where the squads are similar is crucial for Mike Rhoades\u2019 Penn State team to find success, and they can also find optimism in the fact that the blue and white typically generate more steals and turn the ball over less than Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>This metric could result in Penn State opting to press for those turnovers, where it can create an advantage, which actually isn\u2019t a terrible idea. According to Evan Miyakawa\u2019s tempo ratings, they both rank similarly, with Penn State taking the edge and also playing more comfortably in faster-paced games than the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>Player personnel</p>\n                <p>When taking an analytical and literal approach, the Buckeyes again hold the advantage, with only the margins favoring Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Bruce Thornton leads Ohio State behind his over 20 points per game average, joined by two other upperclassmen and sophomore John Mobley Jr., the second-leading scorer, as the Buckeyes top offensive contributors.</p>\n                <p>The scarlet and gray possess a roster efficient at all levels, whether it's just a duo or trio or an overall five-man unit. However, the Nittany Lions, which largely tinkered with starting groups due to injury and a young core, actually possess a more efficient five-man lineup of Freddie Dilione V, Kayden Mingo, Josh Reed, Eli Rice and Ivan Juri\u0107.</p>\n                <p>That's a group for Penn State that Rhoades doesn\u2019t typically appear altogether, with Dilione and Mingo rotating in the backcourt, yet Rhoades may need to change that, as the unit posts a better observed efficiency rating.</p>\n                <p>Oh, hello again</p>\n                <p>Penn State enters Ohio State\u2019s campus for the first time this year, and for most of the roster, the first time.</p>\n                <p>Only Dilione and Dom Stewart returned for Penn State in last year's clash with the Buckeyes in State College, where it received a thumping in Rec Hall. On the contrary, Ohio State retained three starters, but most of its second unit is made up of new arrivals.</p>\n                <p>The player most familiar with this occasion will be former Penn State forward and current Buckeye sixth-year, Puff Johnson, who received a temporary waiver to return to action. Johnson will make his second appearance since his return against his old squad, after playing four minutes in a loss to Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Johnson is a key storyline to watch, and especially how he\u2019s handled by both squads in this one. Ohio State may opt to use his services due to his familiarity with Rhoades\u2019 scheme, while Penn State may know just the way to counter its former star.</p>\n                <p>Both squads face off in a primetime FS1 matchup on Monday at 7:00 p.m., and both have a chance to make a statement. For Penn State, it's to show it isn\u2019t done fighting or improving despite a difficult season.</p>\n                <p>At the same time, Ohio State has a chance to differentiate itself from the middle of the pack in the conference in emphatic fashion.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 8 Penn State began a gauntlet of Big Ten contests Friday night, facing three of the top-five teams in the next trio of series, starting with No. 5 Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>After the Nittany Lions\u2019 dominant 7-2 win in their first meeting with the Badgers, the two were back for a Saturday night rematch at the Kohl Center.</p>\n                <p>Penn State secured the series sweep with a 3-1 comeback win Saturday night.</p>\n                <p>The physicality of Big Ten contests is nothing new.</p>\n                <p>Following a five-penalty first period on Friday night, the blue and white\u2019s rematch with the Badgers began with the same theme.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were first to the power play. Wisconsin\u2019s Jack Horbach laid a high hit on defenseman Nick Fascia, and although immediately reviewed for a major penalty, the forward was only awarded a two-minute minor.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s powerplay came inches from an early score, but a tic-tac-toe passing play captained by Gavin McKenna was eventually stuffed at the doorstep by Wisconsin goaltender Daniel Hauser.</p>\n                <p>The prime opportunity quickly dissolved for the Nittany Lions, and after a bouncing puck was intercepted off forward Matt DiMarsico\u2019s stick, Wisconsin\u2019s Tyson Dyck sent Christian Fitzgerald on a shorthanded breakaway.</p>\n                <p>Fitzgerald snuck his shot through the five-hole of goaltender Kevin Riedler, and gave the Badgers a 1-0 lead just under seven minutes into the first period.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s early momentum stalled after Wisconsin\u2019s goal, and the remaining minutes of the first frame were a back-and-forth effort.</p>\n                <p>With just over a minute to go in the period, the Nittany Lions were given a second chance on the man-advantage after one of the Badgers\u2019 top producers, Quinn Finley, was called for hooking.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white couldn\u2019t get one through as the buzzer rang in the first period.</p>\n                <p>Although starting the middle frame with almost a minute remaining on the power play, Penn State remained scoreless and was still chasing a goal.</p>\n                <p>Like Friday\u2019s matchup, the Nittany Lions began the middle frame trailing the Badgers, but unlike the first meeting, there was no three-goal performance to erase the deficit.</p>\n                <p>The two top-10 ranked teams continued their evenly matched battle. Wisconsin held the slight 11-9 edge in shots, and each had an opportunity on the man-advantage, but neither could capitalize and add to the scoring.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers thought they doubled their lead with about three minutes to go after forward Ryan Botterill found the back of the net, but the officials immediately waived it off for goaltender interference.</p>\n                <p>A challenge by the Wisconsin bench led to a short review, which confirmed a defender colliding with Reidler before the score, and the first-period goal was still the only score heading into the final 20 minutes.</p>\n                <p>After 45 minutes of scoreless play, sophomore JJ Wiebusch found the equalizer for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>The Verona, Wisconsin, native got the Nittany Lions on the board in his hometown arena, after firing a shot from the high slot that found its way through traffic and into the back of the Badgers' net.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white picked up some momentum after Wiebusch\u2019s score, and just over eight minutes later, forward Reese Laubach doubled the lead.</p>\n                <p>An initial shot from DiMarsico sent a rebound out to Laubach, who finished the shot over a diving Hauser, and gave Penn State its first lead of the night with about seven minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions sealed the 3-1 comeback win and series sweep after McKenna potted an empty net goal in the remaining seconds of the third period.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State is back at home hosting No. 2 Michigan State, first slated for a 6 p.m. puck drop at Pegula Ice Arena on Jan. 30, before hitting the ice for the outdoor game at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

He had a hop on his opening front double tuck and underrotated his full twisting double back dismount, taking a big step to the front and side for a 13.050.</p>\n                <p>Matt Underhill was cleaner in the second spot. He had small hops throughout, including on his double layout and front double pike, but just a small shuffle on his full twisting double back gave him a 13.550.</p>\n                <p>In his first floor routine of 2026, Luke Esparo put up a big 13.700. He had a hop in the wrong direction on his opening combination front double pike, but stuck his double twist along the side. He was underrotated on his dismount but had a solid effort overall.</p>\n                <p>Shaun Smith closed out the rotation with a flat 13.00 following a bounding step forward on his front double tuck and big hops on his full twisting double layout.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Bobby Alessio opened the rotation with a hit. His entire routine was packed with flair elements, and he managed to fly up into a handstand on his dismount for a 12.850.</p>\n                <p>Ritam Malik followed the redshirt sophomore with a 13.800. He had some form issues with leg separation after his one pommel work, but stayed on the horse and landed his dismount.</p>\n                <p>Ricky Perez kept the momentum moving. He competes in a tricky routine with Russian elements. The freshman was a bit slow to get up to his handstand, but dismounted cleanly for a 13.650.</p>\n                <p>Landson Simpson also put up a hit routine in the anchor position. He was dynamic and quick with his Thomas flairs, flying up to handstand for a season-high 13.850.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Bobby Haberstock opened the rotation with a low 11.550. He had some control issues throughout his strength elements, and then was unable to get his dismount around to his feet, landing on his stomach.</p>\n                <p>Akseli Karsikas got the team back on track with a 13.750. He also stumbled a bit on his dismount, taking a large step forward, but putting it to his feet.</p>\n                <p>Needing a big score, elite rings competitor Underhill came through in a huge way, putting up the best score in the nation so far this season. He was steady throughout, sticking his dismount cold for a massive 14.700.</p>\n                <p>Esparo closed out the rotation with a 14.300, the second-best score in the nation behind his teammate. The junior bent his elbow a bit on his final strength element and took two hops on his dismount, but helped Penn State bounce back after the fall in a big way.</p>\n                <p>At the halfway point, and despite Haberstock\u2019s fall, Penn State skyrocketed to the top of the pack with a 161.850. EVO trailed with a 161.100, followed by Illinois\u2019 160.000 and Florida Storm\u2019s 136.900.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Penn State moved to the vault, where all four gymnasts competed a Tsuk two and a half with varying degrees of success.</p>\n                <p>Kellen Ryan started the rotation with a massive step to the right for a 13.750. Simpson underrotated his vault, sitting it down for a low 12.800.</p>\n                <p>Underhill bounced back with just a small hop on his landing for a 13.800. However, the highlight of the rotation was Smith, who stuck the blind landing cold for a rotation-high and season-high 14.150.</p>\n                <p>Penn State extended its lead over EVO to a full point heading into the final two rotations.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Five</p>\n                <p>Malik led off the parallel bars rotation cleanly. He had a few unnecessary hand movements early and took a big step to the side on his piked dismount, but scored a solid 12.900.</p>\n                <p>Esparo continued his big day for the Nittany Lions with a 13.500 after just a small hop back on his double pike dismount.</p>\n                <p>Kacper Garnczarek competed in the first routine of the day in the third slot. He opened strong but was unable to cleanly hit his handstand after a giant need to adjust both his hands to regain balance. He also took two hops on his double front dismount, which lowered his score to a 13.150.</p>\n                <p>Simpson anchored the rotation cleanly despite a big arch in his final handstand position and a large step forward on his dismount. He scored a 13.700 as Penn State dropped its lead, trailing EVO 269.600-270.500 into the final rotation.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Six</p>\n                <p>Ryan opened the highbar rotation. He caught his Coleman and Kovacs taking a small step forward on his dismount for a 12.750.</p>\n                <p>Esparo was unable to finish his day on a high note. He was too far away from the bar on his Kovacs and was unable to grab it.

    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State closed out a two-game series against Delaware at 1 p.m on Saturday with its annual Senior Day tradition. Six seniors and a pair of graduate students were honored in lieu of the pre-game starting lineup announcement.</p>\n                <p>Members of the graduating class include captain Tessa Janecke, assistant captains Katelyn Roberts, Mya Vaslet, Leah Stecker, Kendall Butze, Maddy Christian, as well as Taylor Lum and goaltender Katie DeSa.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey're pros,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said. \u201cThe way that they approach everything here, from school to hockey to the community, they do everything the right way. They're super connected. And I think it's a group that, years down the years down the road, will stay connected.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions, regardless of graduation status, showed up to play on the special day. Backed by the supportive Roar Zone, <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/women_hockey/no-4-penn-state-women-s-hockey-utilizes-four-goal-first-period-in-series-sweep/article_1ff8895a-45e9-4859-bbc1-2ae4c40b41f7.html\" target=\"_blank\">Penn State posted a clean 7-0</a> scoreline to sweep the series over the Fightin\u2019 Blue Hens. With this victory, Penn State clinched the AHA Regular Season Championship, improving to 24-4 overall and 17-1 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>And it didn\u2019t take long for the senior class to get moving.</p>\n                <p>In the first period, Janecke tallied a pair of goals that sandwiched Lum\u2019s score. In her last series before heading overseas to play in the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games for Team USA, Janecke lasered a shot through three defenders off the post and into the back of the net 16 seconds into the game, assisted by Christian and Butze.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was really cool that we scored 15 seconds in with those six players on the ice,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThey've obviously had terrific careers, and that was a nice touch for Senior Day, and that got us going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lum scored three minutes later, picking up a bounce off the end boards on a shot by Danica Maynard. She ripped the puck into a wide-open net for her fourth goal of the season, increasing Penn State\u2019s lead to 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Janecke\u2019s second came from the same spot in the high slot for Penn State\u2019s third goal, assisted by Roberts, who sent the primary feed to Janecke.</p>\n                <p>The second period saw Butze and Vaslet linking up to assist on Nicole Hall\u2019s goal to further the gap to 6-0. Although she didn\u2019t score, Vaslet rang a shot off the iron on a breakaway. Janecke had a breakaway of her own, but she was dragged down before she was able to deke.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(The seniors) have been so helpful,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAll of them are so kind and helpful every day. They're an awesome group, and it's not going to be the same without them here next year.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Butze capped off the afternoon in the third period with Penn State\u2019s seventh unanswered goal, when she fired a wrist shot from the point that found an opening over goaltender Mattie Robitzer\u2019s shoulder. Butze\u2019s four-point game puts her at 23 points on the season and 84 in her career, which tied Lyndie Lobdell for Penn State\u2019s all-time assists by a defenseman.</p>\n                <p>DeSa made history as the final horn blared, as her 21st career shutout broke the program-record for all-time shutouts set by Josie Bothun in the 2023-24 season.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(DeSa) was behind Josie at that time, but she stayed the course and exceeded all expectations of her,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe did an amazing job again. Today wasn\u2019t the easiest game; she gets called in in different flurries for her to get called back to lock-in down the stretch.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After falling to Washington 81-65 on Wednesday, Penn State took a trip to Eugene to face Oregon. Both teams entered the game with a chance to break a losing streak: the 7-13 Lady Lions had dropped their last nine, and the Ducks lost their last four, entering at 14-7.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white couldn\u2019t build off its fast start, falling 89-59.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got the party started with a 7-0 scoring run, forcing Oregon coach Kelly Graves to burn a timeout less than two minutes into the game</p>\n                <p>Both teams went scoreless for two minutes after the break, until Sarah Rambus netted a layup for the Ducks\u2019 first points of the game.</p>\n                <p>After a three-pointer from Vit\u00f3ria Santana, the Lady Lions went cold as Oregon turned up the defensive pressure, but the Ducks kept quacking. Graves\u2019 squad went on an 8-0 run to tie the game up at 10 with three minutes to play in the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white ended its scoring drought with a layup from freshman guard Viktoria Ranisavljevic, but nonetheless, Oregon surged to take a 16-12 lead after the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>Both teams traded 5-0 scoring runs to start the second frame, but Avary Cain nailed back-to-back threes to give the Ducks a 28-19 lead heading into the first media timeout.</p>\n                <p>Oregon wasted no time coming out of the pause, with Katie Fiso charging the paint for two points. Fiso\u2019s attempt was quickly matched by T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante to put Penn State\u2019s deficit back to single digits.</p>\n                <p>Rambus and Kiyomi McMiller, each team's leading scorers for the game, seemed to be the only ones able to put the ball in the basket. That was until Ranisavljevic went on a 6-0 run by herself to cut the Ducks\u2019 lead to 38-34 with under a minute left in the quarter.</p>\n                <p>Ari Long nailed a two-point jumper with 30 seconds left, but the Lady Lions were unable to respond, giving Oregon a six-point lead heading into the locker room.</p>\n                <p>It was a sloppy first half, with both teams combining for 11 turnovers. With the absence of Gracie Merkle due to injury, the Ducks were able to net 20 points in the paint in the opening half, as opposed to the blue and white\u2019s 16.</p>\n                <p>Cl\u00e8ante got fouled to start the quarter, but only came away with one free throw. Ehis Etute answered with a quick two on the other end.</p>\n                <p>It was raining threes in Matthew Knight Arena for Oregon in the first portion of the third frame as the Ducks went three-for-three from beyond the arc right before a much-needed timeout was called by coach Carolyn Kieger.</p>\n                <p>Even with a timeout, the quarter remained all Oregon. The Ducks stormed for a 14-0 to take a 61-40 lead with just under four minutes to go in the frame. The run was ended with a two-pointer from McMiller, but momentum remained with the home team.</p>\n                <p>In a nearly flawless third quarter, Oregon outscored Penn State 34-11 to carry a 74-45 lead into the final frame. The Ducks shot 4-for-6 from three-point range and forced the Lady Lions to turn the ball over five times in the third.</p>\n                <p>After a quiet third quarter, McMiller netted the first points of the fourth for the blue and white with a layup. Fiso matched right away on the other end with a drive to the basket.</p>\n                <p>Even after McMillers\u2019 bucket, Penn State continued to struggle finding the hoop, missing four straight field goals and going on a two-minute scoring drought.</p>\n                <p>The drought ended when freshman Nyla McFadden was rewarded two points from the foul line. McFadden went on to score the next four points for the Lady Lions, but Oregon still held a comfortable 82-52 lead with just over five minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>As the clock fell just under two minutes, Kieger used her final timeout with the Ducks up 87-55. McFadden continued to show out in the fourth, with seven of her team-high 15 points coming in the frame.</p>\n                <p>The absence of Merkle was evident as points in the paint continued to plague Penn State. Oregon finished with 50 points from the inside and four Ducks scored in double figures.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Amiya Evans remains listed as out for the Lady Lions. Leading scorer Gracie Merkle was also sidelined after suffering a head injury against Washington.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns home to host Minnesota at 6 p.m. Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Due to the Saturday night arrival of winter storm Fern, No. 1 Penn State faced a quick turnaround to hit the road against Maryland.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions breezed through the Terrapins, moving faster than the wind in College Park, Maryland, en route to a 51-0 victory quick enough to beat the snow back to Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how it happened.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. Abram Cline (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl opened the match with wrist control for the first minute, leading to a takedown 60 seconds into the match. That was the only takedown Abram Cline let up in the first period, but Lilledahl took over in the second.</p>\n                <p>After keeping Cline down for over a minute, he secured two more takedowns before narrowly missing a pin as time expired on the second round.</p>\n                <p>Cline\u2019s defensive stance and Lilledahl\u2019s aggressive push led to two-stall calls against the Terrapin, and a match contested largely on the edge of the mat. Two more takedowns on the border and over two minutes of riding time secured the 19-4 tech fall for Lilledahl.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 5, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 15 Braxton Brown (UMD)</p>\n                <p>The pair of 133-pounders spent a majority of the first round locked in a collar-and-elbow tie up, only breaking after a mad scramble that resulted in Marcus Blaze taking Braxton Brown down from the legs. The second period saw a similar scramble, where Brown attempted to push Blaze, only to have the momentum turned against him.</p>\n                <p>The third period saw Brown go defensive, allowing a takedown and a stall call to bring the match to major-decision territory for Blaze. The Nittany Lion was awarded on final takedown as the buzzer sounded while both men were in an apparent stalemate on the ground, extending the win to 15-3.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 9, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. Dario Lemus (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Much like Friday night, Braeden Davis was working at a faster pace than prior weeks as he took on Dario Lemus. He rushed Lemus and secured the first takedown one minute in. He landed a second takedown a minute later and rode out the frame trying to flip a prone Lemus.</p>\n                <p>After Lemus chose to start the second period on the bottom, Davis held onto him until his riding time crossed over a minute, then took him down again soon after the escape. Davis landed his fourth takedown after prying Lemus\u2019 hands off of his ankle with seconds to spare in the period.</p>\n                <p>Davis got another takedown with a minute remaining and worked on a near fall to secure a tech fall. He couldn\u2019t turn him, but secured a stalling point. However, Lemus escaped with seven seconds to ensure the bout ended as an 18-4 major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 13, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 7 Carter Young (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Carter Young was undefeated in dual matches entering Saturday and was Shayne Van Ness\u2019 toughest matchup of the season.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness started the aggression with an attack, but Young kept Van Ness staggered before reversing the takedown. He locked Van Ness into a cradle and received four-nearfall points before Van Ness escaped. After the first period, Young led Van Ness, 7-1.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness turned the tide in the second period, escaping and launching two quick takedowns to draw even. Two more takedowns in a matter of seconds had Van Ness up 14-10. He kept letting Young escape to launch more attacks. The Nittany Lion led 17-11 after Round 2.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness kept pushing Young down by the neck while on top in the third period, resulting in a stall call. Van Ness got two more takedowns before the clock passed 60 seconds remaining, entering major-decision territory. He finished off a tech fall with 30 seconds left, winning by an absurd score of 31-15.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 18, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Mekhi Neal (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mekhi Neal made the first minute difficult for PJ Duke, scampering away from multiple shot attempts and returned to his feet quickly after getting taken down. It only took Duke five seconds to take Neal down again.</p>\n                <p>One more quick takedown had Neal trapped in a cradle, and with a minute left in the first period, Duke was awarded the pin.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 24, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. AJ Rodrigues (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink took down AJ Rodrigues quickly, and racked up 11-near fall points and over two minutes of riding time before the first period ended. He led 14-0 but appeared upset that he didn\u2019t finish off the tech fall.</p>\n                <p>All he had to do was stand up in the second period to secure the 15-0 victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 29, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Seth Digby (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines was physically in control of Seth Digby throughout this bout, racking up riding time after two takedowns, and spent his time trying to cradle Digby. Haines only led 6-1 at the end of the first, but had two minutes of riding time under his name.</p>\n                <p>Haines got two more takedowns in Period 2, but Digby kept his center of gravity low to the mat, refusing to let Haines turn him for any back points.</p>\n                <p>Digby caught Haines by surprise to take him down at the start of Period 3, but Haines caught another gear after standing back up. Digby went on a defensive stand after that, unsuccessfully trying to keep Haines away from a tech fall. Haines crossed the 15-point threshold with 26 seconds remaining, winning 23-7.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 34, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. Sepanta Ahanj-Elias (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh followed the team trend of landing the first takedown right around the one-minute mark. His second score came via a double-leg slam that thumped Sepanta Ahnaj-Elias down to the mat for the rest of the period.</p>\n                <p>The second period opened with Welsh on the bottom, but he stood up and quickly pinned Ahanj-Elias before the frame reached its midpoint.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 40, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 13 Branson John (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Branson John used his height advantage to fend off Josh Barr for most of the first period, but after John mistimed an attack, Barr seized his leg and landed the first takedown.</p>\n                <p>He got one more takedown in the second period, then picked the ankle once more in the third, and quickly flipped John but over-spun to just miss the pin. Two more takedowns handed Barr the 19-4 victory and Penn State another tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 45, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Joey Schneck (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mirasola got his next takedown one minute into Round 2 and impressively locked a standing cradle on Schneck, dropping him for the pin.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 51, Maryland 0</p>",

Burkhart threw for 20.26m, followed by Sam Engebretson\u2019s 19.32m throw for second place.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s success continued in the men\u2019s 3000-meter as senior Logan Strawser led the way with a personal best 8:08.84.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s 60-meter dash, freshman Lucas Band was the only competitor for the Nittany Lions. However, he earned a personal best 6.90 and qualified for the finals in eighth place, followed by another personal best 6.87 for seventh place in the finals.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Alexandria North continued her success from last weekend in the 400 meters, as she finished fifth with a time of 54.92.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s pole vault, senior Tristan McGarrah neared his season best with a second-place finish with 2.04 meters.</p>\n                <p>While junior Lizzie Schreiber didn\u2019t compete in the long jump, she came back and won the men\u2019s triple jump with a meet-record jump of 12.69m.</p>\n                <p>The women\u2019s shot put saw a pair of personal bests come from Penn State\u2019s two competitors, as sophomore Skye Petrie-Cameron finished third with a throw of 15.58m. Fellow sophomore Sasha Garnett threw 14.97 for fourth place.</p>\n                <p>After Strawser won the 3000m earlier in the day, junior Nick Sloff competed in the elite men\u2019s 3000m, where he broke the school record. Sloff won the race in 7:48.56, breaking the Penn State record by nearly two seconds.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 success continued into the men\u2019s 200m, where Ajani Dwyer won his first 200m of the season with a personal best and No. 2 time in Penn State history of 20.52 \u2014 the current top mark in the NCAA.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wrapped up the action on the field with the men\u2019s shot put, where Brady Mider and Sam Engebretson finished second and third. Mider threw a personal best 16.78m throw, while Engebretson threw for 16.75m.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will return home for the Penn State National Open on Friday at the Horace Ashenfelter III Indoor Track.</p>\n                <p>MORE TRACK AND FIELD COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>After suffering a 3-0 sweep to McKendree last night, Penn State got another look at the Bearcats today, hoping to avoid a second-straight loss.</p>\n                <p>It was much of the same on Saturday, though, as the Nittany Lions fell to McKendree 3-1 for a series sweep.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was first on the board after a Miller Trubey service ace opened the scoring. The Nittany Lions went on a 4-0 scoring run until a Miller error got the Bearcats back into it.</p>\n                <p>After trading points back-and-forth, Penn State found itself down 19-14 after a Tyler Tripp kill put McKendree in a prime position to win the first set.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions kept it interesting, but a Bryce Wetjen kill solidified it as the Bearcats captured the first set.</p>\n                <p>It couldn\u2019t have been more different in the early running of the second set, though, as Penn State jumped ahead to an early 8-3 lead. Most of the points came from errors, though Miller, Gabriel Gaige and Sean Harvey recorded kills.</p>\n                <p>A 3-0 Bearcat scoring run forced Mark Pavlik and the Nittany Lions into a timeout, holding a 17-12 advantage.</p>\n                <p>McKendree stuck around, going on another 3-0 scoring run, but Penn State stole the second set, winning 25-19 with the help of another Miller kill.</p>\n                <p>With the match now tied at 1-1, the third set proved to be the tightest of the lot in the early bits with points being traded back and forth, but back-to-back Rolen Lively kills gave the Bearcats a 7-5 lead.</p>\n                <p>The action remained tight, with Penn State fighting for a score, cutting into McKendree\u2019s lead with another Harvey kill that made the blue and white\u2019s deficit just two points.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back kills tied it up for the Nittany Lions at 17 apiece, but the Bearcats just kept putting it together, going on another scoring run to command a 21-18 lead.</p>\n                <p>With the end of the third set in sight, Tripp picked up his 11th kill of the day, which helped McKendree capture the third set 25-22.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was closing in right at the end of the set, with Harvey and Trubey picking up their eighth and ninth kills, but it just wasn\u2019t enough, and the blue and white moved one set closer to a loss.</p>\n                <p>Now closer to suffering a series sweep, the Nittany Lions once again started off the scoring first, and Owen Rose matched a McKendree service ace with one of his own as the third set got off to a flying start.</p>\n                <p>Another Harvey kill, and a Tripp error on the attack made it a 6-5 advantage for the blue and white. Penn State temporarily held a two-point lead, but the play was overturned and ruled a Lively kill, tying it up for the Bearcats at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>A controversial score ruling gave McKendree a 15-11 lead, as the Bearcats were slowly pulling away and getting closer to sweeping the Nittany Lions. Rattled, Penn State used another timeout after a Harvey error.</p>\n                <p>The Bearcats, now putting the hurt on the blue and white, took a 19-15 lead, forcing another Pavlik timeout after a Gaige error.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was drawing dead but stayed alive with a Jaidyn Bethel kill effort, which was matched with another from Harvey and one from freshman Tristan Hassell, who recorded 13 kills against Lewis a week ago.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions closed the gap and worked their deficit down to 21-20 after a Jack Morikawa service error silenced the Bearcat end of the floor.</p>\n                <p>Action was tied up at 24-24, but a Lively kill put McKendree back up in front as the game was coming to a head.</p>\n                <p>The Bearcats kept scoring but Penn State was resilient and not letting things end so easily. The blue and white effort was all for nothing, though, as a Sam Hoskin kill sealed the deal, winning the fourth and final set 28-26 for McKendree.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action this Friday to host No. 3 Hawaii at Rec Hall in the whiteout game.</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s match is scheduled for 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State returned to Pegula Ice Arena for its first home series since November. In a successful welcome back party, the Nittany Lions blanked Delaware 5-0 in Game 1 of the series. This game also marked the first game of senior weekend as eight students were honored throughout the series.</p>\n                <p>A four-goal first period quickly gave the Nittany Lions momentum that they didn\u2019t lose the entire game, leading to a 7-0 win.</p>\n                <p>Coach Jeff Kampersal spoke briefly on the \u201cslow start\u201d following the 5-0 win. Kampersal alluded to the seven games on the road before returning to Pegula. However, the Nittany Lions didn\u2019t take long to get on the board in Game 2 as Tessa Janecke found the net only 16 seconds into the game.</p>\n                <p>The Orangeville, Illinois, native quickly made her way into the offensive zone and ripped a wrist shot through two defensemen. An all-around gritty effort from the senior on senior day.</p>\n                <p>Janecke, along with Nicole Hall, played their last regular season series as they departed for the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>The early scoring didn\u2019t stop there as Danica Maynard took the puck off the faceoff and shot a pass that bounced off the end boards and right onto Taylor Lum\u2019s stick. Lum didn\u2019t hesitate to bury the puck into the wide-open net.</p>\n                <p>This was Lum\u2019s fourth goal of the season and a senior\u2019s second of the game.</p>\n                <p>Abby Stonehouse had a perfect chance to add to the 2-0 lead as she was all alone with the goalie at the top of the crease. However, Mattie Robitzer decided this was a great time to flash the leather as she robbed Stonehouse with her glove.</p>\n                <p>Janecke wasn\u2019t finished in the opening period as Penn State was on the power play. The senior took advantage after a wrist shot from the high slot quickly found the net.</p>\n                <p>Stonehouse quickly followed suit as she intercepted a shot in front of the net from Katelyn Roberts. The Blenheim, Ontario, native went from her forehand to backhand and beat Robitzer.</p>\n                <p>Although Penn State found success in the goal department, the opening period came to a close with it on the penalty kill.</p>\n                <p>Second-line magic opened the second period for Penn State. Mikah Keller sent a pass to Grace Outer from below the red line. Outwater took quick work of the puck as she found an opening in the top-right corner.</p>\n                <p>Nicole Hall then joined Janecke as olympians to score in this game as she sent a wrist shot from the high slot that was zipped by Robitzer.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions spent the majority of the second period in its offensive zone, however they were caught being too aggressive at times. Both Janecke and Hall spent time in the penalty box for being a little too aggressive on the boards. The penalty kill for Penn State took this middle frame to shine as it killed both penalties.</p>\n                <p>The third period saw a slower tempo in its first 10 minutes as both teams had opportunities to add to the scoreboard. That was until Kendall Butze sent a slapshot from the point that found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>Tempers began to flare after a heavy hit was laid on Outwater at center ice. The Picton, Ontario, native didn\u2019t take too kindly to the hit and laid a return bodycheck post-whistle. Ultimately leading to four-four with two minutes to go.</p>\n                <p>No additions to the scoreboard were made after the late-game scuffle as Penn State swept the Blue Hens after back-to-back shutouts.</p>\n                <p>With this shutout, Katie Desa now holds the record for all-time shutouts in Penn State history.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State makes its way across the street for an outdoor game at Beaver Stadium against Robert Morris on Jan. 30 at 1 p.m. The Nittany Lions then return to Pegula Ice Arena for Game 2 on Jan. 31 at 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>With a winter storm warning ahead, Penn State brought a storm of its own to Rec Hall Saturday with its highest score this season.</p>\n                <p>Putting up an elite-level day, the Nittany Lions beat Maryland 197.250-196.675.</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions managed a big 49.150 on vault to open the meet, courtesy of senior Ava Piedrahita\u2019s massive 9.900 in the anchor position on her unique half on, pike off.</p>\n                <p>Elizabeth Leary got the rotation off on the right foot with a stuck Yurchenko full for a 9.825. Allison Kaempfer was another standout in the rotation, scoring a career-high 9.850 on her Yuchenko 1.5, no longer struggling with under rotation.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Ava Cash got her chance, scoring a solid 9.800 on her Yurchenko full with a hop back. Jessica Johanson and Dani Latronica each struggled a bit, dipping below the 9.800 mark with a 9.725 and 9.775, with some hops on the landings.</p>\n                <p>However, with Johanson\u2019s score dropping, the blue and white took an early, but small .075 lead.</p>\n                <p>On the bars, Maryland was solid, only counting one score below the 9.800-plus range. The highlight of the rotation was Aine Reade\u2019s 9.850; however, without a big 9.900, the Terps had some catching up to do.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Penn State gave the fans in Rec Hall a show to watch on the bars, scoring a huge 49.450 to extend its lead over Maryland to 98.600-98.050 at the halfway point.</p>\n                <p>Ellie Monahan opened the rotation off with 9.850. She nailed her handstands throughout and stuck her full twisting double back dismount to get the team started. Johanson was short on her pirouette handstand on the low bar and took a hop back on her double layout, scoring a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>In the third slot, Leary got the scores rising again. Nailing her release sequence and sticking her double back dismount, she managed a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>Cash followed her with another 9.875. She got a beautiful height on her piked jaegar. She was short on her final handstand, but as the sticky feet were contagious, she nailed her dismount as well.</p>\n                <p>Piedrahita tied her own score from the vault with another 9.900 and a stuck landing, paving the way for the event-winner Latronica.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore anchor put up a massive 9.950 in the anchor position. Her piked jaeger was massive, and she hit her overshoot to handstand right on top of the bar. Keeping up with her teammates, she stuck her landing.</p>\n                <p>On the vault, Maryland could not keep up with Penn State\u2019s pace. The Terrapins managed only one vault better than a 9.800 courtesy of Taylor Rech\u2019s 9.850. Maryland opened the door for Penn State to extend its lead and the Nittany Lions did just that.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Penn State was unable to keep the same momentum on bars, but put together a solid rotation on beam with a 49.175. Monahan kicked things off with a huge routine. Nailing her front-toss combination and sticking her 1.5 dismount for a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Kramer kept the steady performance going with her back handspring back layout acro series and another stuck dismount to improve on her two previous 9.775s with a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Maul began the string of triple acro series off with a bang. She was slightly underrotated on her dismount, having to take a hop in the wrong direction, which dipped her score to a 9.775</p>\n                <p>Kalea McElligott got the scores back on track with a 9.825 courtesy of her triple series, followed by a stuck dismount.</p>\n                <p>Leary had a big wobble on her series. She took a small hop on her dismount as well, finishing off a shaky routine with a low 9.675.</p>\n                <p>Latronica, with pressure to drop the 9.75, ended the rotation on a high note. Nailing her series and difficult leaps, the sophomore stuck her gainer full to bounce back with a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>On the floor, Maryland got its momentum back in a huge way. Madeline Komoroski and Reade both had an event-winning 9.975, meaning one judge gave them each a perfect 10.0. That massive score alongside a few other 9.900s helped Maryland put up a 49.575 on the event to cut Penn State\u2019s lead down to 147.775-147.625.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>With the Terrapins on their heels, the Nittany Lions managed to score a 49.475 on the floor to keep them at bay.</p>\n                <p>Maul, the usual leadoff, brought big energy to open the rotation with a solid two passes, including a strong double back for a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Monahan had too much momentum on her front double full, not fully controlling her lunge forward. She reeled in the power on her second pass for a matching 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Bella Misiura opened her only routine of the day with another front double full and a really controlled landing on her second pass to begin building the scores with a 9.900.</p>\n                <p>Johanson struggled on her double pike, landing a bit straight-legged for a pogo-stick-type hop but cleaned up the landing on her second pass for a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Not to be outdone, Kramer showcased control on both of her passes to manage a 9.975 of her own to a co-champion of the event alongside Komoroski and Reade.</p>\n                <p>Having already clinched the win, McElligott only widened Penn State\u2019s victory. Her 9.900 capped off an incredible day for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Maryland was solid on the beam, but with no massive 9.900+ scores, the Terrapins were unable to carry their momentum into a win.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>After shutting out Indiana inside of Rec Hall on Friday, No. 1 Penn State faces a quick turnaround to College Park, Maryland, for a Saturday evening showdown with the No. 29 Terrapins.</p>\n                <p>The dual was originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon, but due to the impending arrival of Winter Storm Fern, the contest at the Schanwald Center was moved to 5 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>As a result of the rescheduling, the broadcast has been moved from Big Ten Network to Big Ten Plus, which is free to watch all weekend throughout the snowstorm.</p>\n                <p>Maryland is a similar opponent to Indiana in that it\u2019s a lower-tier Big Ten opponent that a Penn State lineup, featuring six No. 1 wrestlers, should be expected to cruise through in time to beat the snow back to State College.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. Presden Sanchez (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Both Luke Lilledahl and Presden Sanchez are coming off matches with Indiana\u2019s Jacob Moran. Sanchez suffered a tech fall in his bout, while Lilledahl secured a pin.</p>\n                <p>Sanchez is 0-4 in his redshirt freshman campaign while Lilledahl doesn\u2019t have an official loss on his record this season. Lilledahl should make quick work of the opening match.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 15 Braxton Brown (UMD)</p>\n                <p>One of three ranked matches on the card sees freshman sensation Marcus Blaze challenge three-time NCAA qualifier Braxton Brown.</p>\n                <p>Brown is 13-4 on the season, but none of his wins have come against top-16 opponents. Blaze is arguably the best competition he\u2019s faced this season.</p>\n                <p>Blaze is looking to continue his perfect season against Brown. The freshman is 3-0 with two-bonus point matches against opponents ranked higher than Brown this season.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. Dario Lemus (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Similarly to Brown, Dario Lemus has yet to defeat a top-16 opponent this season. Lemus is 12-7 and is on pace for his first year wrestling attached with a record above .500.</p>\n                <p>However, Braeden Davis has been improving rapidly since returning to the lineup for Penn State and scored 24 points in a victory on Friday. Davis should control the pace in this match.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 7 Carter Young (UMD)</p>\n                <p>The highest ranked match of the dual comes at 149 pounds between Shayne Van Ness and Carter Young. This is the only top-10 match on the card.</p>\n                <p>Young transferred into Maryland from Oklahoma State after going 10-10 in his first season under head coach David Taylor. He has upped his output to an 8-1 record in 2025-26.</p>\n                <p>Young has also beat both top-16 competitors he\u2019s faced and now tests himself against the top-ranked athlete in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness is undefeated on the season, but Young is a higher level of competition than he has faced. Van Ness\u2019 pace can be matched by Young, so expect a lower-scoring match than Van Ness is accustomed to.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Michael Pizzuto (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Michael Pizzuto is a redshirt sophomore with multiple accolades off the mat, including academic all-Big Ten honors. However, on the mat, Pizzuto is .500 in his collegiate career and hasn\u2019t shown the ability to compete with world-class opponents.</p>\n                <p>Duke is just that, especially after receiving his World Championship ring on Friday from USA wrestling after competing in the U20 World Championship event this past summer. His last two matches have ended prior to the third round and that trend should continue against Maryland.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. AJ Rodriguez (UMD)</p>\n                <p>What more needs to be said about Mitchell Mesenbrink other than he is a bonus-point machine. He secured a pin on Friday night and will look to match that effort Saturday.</p>\n                <p>AJ Rodriguez is another Terrapin whose record is floating narrowly above an even showing and has yet to face a top-20 opponent. Mesenbrink will be an evening wake up call for Rodriguez.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Seth Digby (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Continuing up Penn state\u2019s murderers row is another mismatch for U23 World Champion Levi Haines. Haines hasn\u2019t lost since last season\u2019s NCAA finals, and 2-7 freshman Seth Digby isn\u2019t likely to break that trend.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. Sepanta Ahanj-Elias (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Another freshman for the Terrapins, Sepanta Ahanj-Elias bounces between 184 and 197 for Maryland. Going up against the No. 1 in a weight class that involves a heavy cut is a bad sign for the red singlet.</p>\n                <p>Ahnaj-Elias is coming off of a major-decision loss to Sam Goin, who Rocco Welsh defeated on Friday. Welsh should have an easy Saturday retaining his No. 1 spot.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 13 Branson John (UMD)</p>\n                <p>This match features more intrigue than expected at the start of the year, as Branson John has become Maryland\u2019s most improved competitor this season.</p>\n                <p>After scratching into the NCAA tournament last season, John is firmly in contention with a 19-3 record. While he doesn\u2019t have any major victories on his record, he has won via bonus points in half of his matches this year.</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr immediately regained his No. 1 ranking since returning and has been churning ever since. He\u2019s seen close matchups as of late and this has the makings of another tense affair.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Joey Schneck (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Closing out the dual will be Cole Mirasola against Joey Schneck. So far, every time Mirasola faces an unranked opponent, he completes the job in the blink of an eye. Schneck fits that mold perfectly at 5-5.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola shouldn\u2019t struggle against Schneck.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

Samoskevich served as an assistant for two seasons from 2020 to 2022.</p>\n                <p>Never one to take the spotlight, the Beverly, Massachusetts, native revealed that he took a dive to see how many games players from the graduating class of 2026, such as Katelyn Roberts and Tessa Janecke, won during their time in the blue-and-white, an appropriate statistic to research on the eve of Saturday\u2019s \u201cSenior Day\u201d festivities.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to tap them on the shoulders and tell them to go out there and they\u2019re good,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cOur bus of players when they show up is usually better than the other bus of players.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In total, Kampersal has led this group of seniors to 103 wins thus far with still seven regular-season games remaining, plus the AHA conference tournament and NCAA women\u2019s ice hockey tournament.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lion coach is known for making the right decisions, with one of those decisions being the formation of the second line: Maddy Christian, Mikah Keller and Grace Outwater.

Just a great feeling.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Keller shared her insight from her perspective as a freshman playing for Kampersal for the first time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can always know he\u2019s trusting you.

    "description": "<p>Braeden Davis is a man of few words when it comes to speaking into a microphone \u2014 Davis prefers to do his talking on the mat.</p>\n                <p>He did just that in Penn State\u2019s dual against Indiana Friday, dropping 24 points in a major-decision victory over No. 25 Henry Porter. The Hoosier scored 10 points against Davis, keeping him one point shy of a tech-fall finish, but Davis didn\u2019t let the takedown shake his focus on the mat.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been taught that if something goes bad, just go and score another takedown,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t get thrown on my back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Porter offered Davis a modicum of adversity, it was not a worry compared to the treacherous path the junior has walked this season. He\u2019s the only Nittany Lion to have taken a loss in their last six dual matches.</p>\n                <p>That loss came to Iowa\u2019s Nasir Bailey, a loss decided by one point, and in which Davis was seconds away from earning that point via riding time or stalling calls.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a fine line between winning and losing,\u201d Cael Sanderson said on Tuesday. \u201c(Davis) will just keep getting better as we move forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Davis walked to the mat Friday, his new walkout song, \u201cBawitadaba\u201d by Kid Rock, didn\u2019t become audible until the final seconds before his match began, a fitting metaphor for a late-onset season for the defending All-American.</p>\n                <p>At the start of Penn State\u2019s season, Davis was notified he\u2019d be redshirting. Following an offseason that saw Davis mired in <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/news/crime_courts/penn-state-wrestler-faces-criminal-charges-after-incident-outside-tau-kappa-epsilon/article_86091be1-8f50-4aff-86fd-63d4b242353c.html\" target=\"_blank\">off-mat controversy,</a> the additions of Marcus Blaze, Masanosuke Ono and the return of Aaron Nagao, Davis was the odd man out of the lineup.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere was a little bit of confusion at the start of the year but it feels good.\u201d Davis said about returning to the lineup.</p>\n                <p>Davis admittedly didn\u2019t manage his weight with intention during the month-long period where he wasn\u2019t expecting to compete. He only competed at the Kauffman Open in January to start the year. The Belleville, Michigan, native went 4-0 to win the tournament.</p>\n                <p>That week, Davis learned he would burn his expected redshirt after Nagao once again suffered a season-ending injury. Then the work started to get back into starting lineup worthy condition.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAt the time, I thought I was redshirting, so what do you expect?\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo no, I definitely didn\u2019t (manage weight) the best.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson didn't hesitate to give his trusted lightweight the opportunity to hold his spot knowing that Nagao wasn\u2019t likely to return this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe kinda just threw him right in there and that decision is made as he\u2019s a competitor,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe will just keep rolling with things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Getting in shape was easier for Davis than in past years as he moved closer to his natural weight. As a freshman, Davis wrestled down weight at 125 pounds, then bumped up to 133 pounds last season. Weight management is easier for the junior as he bumps up again into the 141-pound slot.</p>\n                <p>Davis\u2019 pace has continued to improve as he works his way deeper into the season, peaking Friday with an eight-takedown performance against Porter. Rec Hall gave Davis a resounding ovation as he left the mat for his largest win of the season. The moment represented Davis finding his place back in Penn State\u2019s starting lineup and finding his comfort in a fluctuating season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a little bit of a challenge at first, but now that I\u2019m down to my normal shape, it\u2019s quite comfortable.\u201d Davis said. \u201c(141-pounds) is probably the most comfortable out of all the weight classes I\u2019ve wrestled so far.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

It's the same boring process of getting better every day and every competition and remain grateful for the opportunities that we have, and all those other things will take care of themselves.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With the win over the Hoosiers, Penn State moved to 10-0 on the year and 4-0 in Big Ten play. It was a dominant showing in front of a Rec Hall crowd that had over 6,200 people show up draped head to toe in the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said Indiana was \u201cscrappy.\u201d The No. 25 Hoosiers ended up recording more takedowns than what No. 4 Iowa recorded against the Nittany Lions a week ago, but Penn State still ended up with bonus points in nine of the 10 victories.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey came out fighting, so it was good for us, and it's good that our guys were able to score a lot of points,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI think when you enjoy what you're doing, points are obviously a good thing, and it's good training and conditioning.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action on Saturday to face Maryland in College Park, as pending snowstorms had the dual moved from Sunday. Sanderson said wrestling in consecutive days will be great preparation for the postseason, where the wrestlers will have to do just that.</p>\n                <p>After blowing out Indiana, the Nittany Lions will face a similar caliber opponent in the Terrapins. Despite blowing out the Hoosiers, and the outcome likely to be very similar against Maryland, Sanderson is expecting his squad to fine-tune mistakes from Friday as it hits the road.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s to be expected from a coach who has led Penn State to 12 national titles as a head coach, because finding miscues in a 48-0 victory is what it takes to create a dynasty like he has.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe weren't at our best at every weight, but we're excited to keep pushing forward here and get right back on the mat,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>",

    "title": "Second line shines, totals six points combined in win over Delaware",
    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State hasn\u2019t played a home series since November of last year. What happened in that game, you may ask? Second line dominance from the three forwards: Maddy Christian, Mikah Keller and Grace Outwater.</p>\n                <p>In their return to Pegula Ice Arena, the forwards continued to shine as three of the five goals for the Nittany Lions came from the second line. The three forwards scored a goal apiece while racking up their points through assists. Ultimately, the line as a whole produced six total points in a 5-0 conference victory over Delaware</p>\n                <p>What makes a line continue production like they have, falls on the players doing their respective parts on a continuous basis. This is seen nearly every shift, especially from their coach, Jeff Kampersal.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMaddy (Christian) has speed and the same skill, Mikah (Keller) has the vision, Grace (Outwater) scores goals and you don\u2019t have to tell her twice to shoot,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThey are going to carry the load moving forward for sure.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Kampersal describes how each player contributes to a talented forward trio, it paints the picture of a three-headed monster. A unit's defensemen don\u2019t want to see skating down the ice on a forecheck.</p>\n                <p>The three have been grouped together for nearly the whole season. Due to this, their chemistry has evolved into bonds never forgotten. As seniors soon depart, such as Christian, forming a bond with her teammates gives her the utmost gratitude as she is more than halfway done with her season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAs a senior, knowing that I have this group, I love it because I know I feel like we all just chem together,\u201d Christian said. \u201cWe all have our different attributes that make us great, and it\u2019s heartwarming to know that I\u2019m there for Mikah and Mikah is there for Grace.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The idea of all three forwards being there for each other was portrayed in a two-on-one opportunity for Outwater and Christian in the game against the Blue Hens. As Outwater received a pass from Leah Stecker from the other end of the ice, it was up to the Picton, Ontario, native to shoot the puck herself or feed a pass to her linemate for the fourth goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>With both possibilities playing in her mind, the forward dished the puck across the crease for a wrist shot from Christian that gave the Nittany Lions a 4-0 lead late in the second period. As testament to the trio being there for each other, Outwater revealed her mindset as she got closer to the net.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was the perfect opportunity to shoot, and then last second I saw Maddy, and I was like \u2018oh my gosh, pass it,\u2019\u201d Outwater said. \u201cShe got it, and it was a really good goal. So, it was nice.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "McKenna\u2019s hat trick propels No. 8 Penn State to comeback victory over No. 5 Wisconsin",
    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky cited his team\u2019s fast starts as a key to its five-game winning streak. His group had scored first in four of its last five games.</p>\n                <p>The No. 8 Nittany Lions\u2019 start to Friday\u2019s contest at the Kohl Center was anything but fast after three first-period penalties put them in an early hole. But behind a pair of hat tricks from Dane Dowiak and Gavin McKenna, plus 39 saves from Josh Fleming, Penn State scored seven unanswered goals to stun No. 5 Wisconsin, 7-2.</p>\n                <p>The comeback victory marked the longest Big Ten winning streak in program history, according to the Big Ten Plus broadcast.</p>\n                <p>Alex Servagno started the game in the penalty box after Penn State\u2019s warm-up infraction. And after Nolan Collins played a puck with a broken stick, the Nittany Lions were down two men just one minute into the period.</p>\n                <p>Enter Fleming, a 2026 Hobey Baker Award nominee, who denied two point-blank chances to keep the game scoreless.</p>\n                <p>Shea Van Olm, who returned from a four-game absence, checked a Wisconsin forward from behind and into the boards. The freshman forward was handed a five-minute major and a game misconduct, which ended his return after just 10 minutes.</p>\n                <p>And while Fleming\u2019s heroism held the Badgers scoreless on their first power play, his first blunder awaited on the ensuing penalty kill. The freshman goaltender denied Tyson Dyck\u2019s initial shot but failed to corral the rebound, which Dyck tapped home for a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Oliver Tulk later sniped a shot past Fleming\u2019s blocker to make it two Wisconsin tallies on its lengthy power play. The Badgers led 18-4 in shots and held a 2-0 advantage at the first intermission \u2014 a lead that could\u2019ve been extended if not for Fleming\u2019s 16 saves.</p>\n                <p>Fleming\u2019s resolve was rewarded two minutes into the second period when Mac Gadowsky backhanded a slot feed to Dowiak, who snapped it top shelf to cut Penn State\u2019s deficit in half. It was a one-score game despite Wisconsin\u2019s 22-7 shots advantage.</p>\n                <p>Following interference and cross-checking calls on the Badgers, it was Penn State\u2019s turn on the 5-on-3. And like its opponent, the Nittany Lions struck twice.</p>\n                <p>McKenna struck first when he skated patiently into the slot before rifling a wrist shot through traffic for his seventh goal of the season. Dowiak followed with a rebound tally, his second goal of the contest, to give Penn State a 3-2 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Shots were 18-18 in the second period. The difference: Fleming stopped all 18 to give himself 34 saves entering the final period.</p>\n                <p>After an abysmal start, the Nittany Lions had silenced the Kohl Center crowd, which went from quiet to stunned when Jackson Smith scored 15 seconds into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Standing near the blue line, the heavy-hitting defenseman threw a wrist shot on goal, hoping to get a deflection and nothing more. But the traffic blocked Daniel Hauser\u2019s vision, and Smith\u2019s shot hit the net to give Penn State a 4-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Smith\u2019s tally provided some insurance, but McKenna wasn\u2019t satisfied. At the halfway point of the period, Penn State\u2019s No. 72 again skated patiently into the offensive zone, this time wristing a shot far side and beyond Hauser\u2019s outstretched blocker for his second goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>Dowiak seemingly took exception to McKenna matching his goal total and raised him one better when he poked a loose puck between Hauser\u2019s five-hole to complete his hat trick. Fleming\u2019s acrobatic pad save to spark Dowiak\u2019s shorthanded tally was a fitting close to a dominant final two periods for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>McKenna added a late tally to complete his first collegiate hat trick, as the Nittany Lions improved to 17-6 and extended their winning streak to six games.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",
