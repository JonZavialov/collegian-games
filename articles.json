    "description": "<p>Penn State is still looking for its first Big Ten win of the season, and that search will continue as another conference loss happened Monday night.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 youthful roster couldn't overcome an 18-point halftime deficit while facing Ohio State, losing 84-78 inside the Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio. Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad dropped to 9-11 on the year and 0-9 in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened the second half on a 27-10 run, cutting Ohio State\u2019s lead down to 60-59 after an and-1 jumper by forward Josh Reed with 10:46 left in the game. The Nittany Lions were consistently threatening the lead early in the second half with wing Eli Rice slimming it down to 58-54 at the 11:57 mark.</p>\n                <p>But as Penn State came close to taking its first lead of the game, the Buckeyes went on a quick 5-0 run behind two free throws and a 3-pointer by guard John Mobley Jr., guiding his squad to a 69-61 advantage. The two squads battled, but Mobley got Ohio State back to a double-digit cushion with another 3-pointer to make it a 74-63 game with 6:38 left.</p>\n                <p>Guard Melih Tunca made multiple baskets down the stretch to keep Penn State in it, and Rice brought the Nittany Lions down 80-76 after a 3-pointer with 23 seconds left. However, it wasn\u2019t enough to fully complete a comeback after late free throws by Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>It was the third-straight game Penn State was losing by 18 points or more at halftime as the Buckeyes led 50-32 at the break. Despite entering the game averaging only 9.1 turnovers per game, the Nittany Lions had 10 turnovers in the first half and only shot 41% from the field.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State, on the other hand, shot 66.7% from the field and 54.5% from 3-point range during the first half. The Buckeyes mounted a 14-2 run midway through the half, and even while Penn State cut the lead to 10 points, they temporarily stopped any comeback from happening with a 12-4 run near the end of the half.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 offense was led by Rice, who totaled a team-high 20 points. Seven-footer Ivan Juri\u0107, Tunca and Reed were all in double figures as well, with the team shooting 50% from the field, 40% from 3-point range and 86% at the stripe.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 registered a double-double with 14 rebounds as well, winning the rebound battle for Penn State, 31 to 21.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State had three players in double figures: Mobley, forward Devin Royal and forward Amare Bynum. Mobley paced the Buckeyes with 25 points, and Ohio State shot 56% from the field, 34.8% from 3-point range and 76.2% at the free-throw line.</p>\n                <p>Monday\u2019s game also saw former Penn State player Puff Johnson in action for Ohio State. Johnson had two points and three rebounds in 14 minutes during his second appearance of the season for the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>Injury report</p>\n                <p>Rotational forward Tibor Mirti\u010d remained listed as \u201cout\u201d on the Big Ten availability report. He hasn\u2019t played since the Michigan game on Jan. 6, which is when he exited with a knee injury.</p>\n                <p>Freshman guard Reggie Grodin is redshirting this year, so he\u2019s listed on the availability report as \u201cout for season.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will travel to Welsh Ryan Arena in Evanston, Illinois, for a game against Northwestern at 8 p.m. Thursday, streamed on Peacock. The Wildcats are 9-11 on the year and 1-8 in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Postion preview | Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse attackmen has star power, lacks depth",
    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will need to have guys step up at the attack position after losing some key pieces in Matt Traynor and Will Peden. The squad also lost key point-getters in Jack Aimone and Ethan Long.</p>\n                <p>Traynor was selected No. 6 overall by the New York Atlas and impressed in his rookie season. Despite the blue and white losing some key contributors, there are a ton of names who could step up this season.</p>\n                <p>Kyle Lehman and Hunter Aquino are expected to be key pieces as attackers.</p>\n                <p>Lehman saw much more time in his sophomore season than he did in his rookie season, and the growth showed. He had a career high in goals with 26 and points with 33. With Lehman being one of the main ball handlers, he\u2019ll be able to spread the ball around more. The junior improved his shot last season and will look to add more assists to the stat sheet.</p>\n                <p>Aquino will now play attack after being a midfielder last season. The Big Ten Freshman of the Year impressed in his first season. Aquino only started nine games but tallied 37 points, including 21 assists. The sophomore had an injury that forced him to slow down during the NCAA Tournament, but the Easton, Pennsylvania native will be focused on potting in points in his first year as an attackman.</p>\n                <p>Liam Matthews became an important piece during the second half of the season. Despite only starting seven games, Matthews was second on the team in goals with 28. He had the highlight of two behind-the-back goals against Cornell and is expected to have more highlights this season.</p>\n                <p>The depth beyond these three attackmen is thin and unknown. The only player to appear in a collegiate game is Wesley Scurci, who played in two games last season and in 12 games for Lindenwood in 2022-23. The redshirt junior didn\u2019t have any points for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Jack Iannantunono was ranked as the No. 60 player in the 2025 class, according to Inside Lacrosse. The freshman could be a rotation piece at attack this season for the blue and white, considering the lack of experience at depth.</p>\n                <p>Matthew Beachley could be another name to watch. The freshman is in a similar situation to Iannantunono. He could start as a rotational piece and work his way up the depth chart. Beachley is not as highly ranked as Iannantunono, but was still rated as a four-star prospect and has potential.</p>\n                <p>Enzo Grieco redshirted last season and is likely at the bottom of the depth chart, while Matthew Beachley could redshirt this season.</p>\n                <p>The attack show will run through Matthews and Aquino, who\u2019ll likely score a majority of the points for the Nittany Lions in 2026.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Taylor McGillvray | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State filed a lawsuit against several major healthcare companies on Jan. 13 alleging that they intentionally increased insulin prices. The university claims the price hikes forced its self-funded healthcare system, which covers staff, faculty, retirees and their dependents, to pay artificially high costs for diabetes medications.</p>\n                <p>The average cost of some diabetes medication has risen more than ten times the amount average consumer goods and services have over the past two decades, according to court documents. The lawsuit alleges that the price increase is not a result of market-driven variables, but the medication was instead engineered by the companies in a way that would increase their profit.</p>\n                <p>Manufacturing defendants Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk allegedly raised prices on purpose to maximize their profit margins within a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d rebate system. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx, along with their parent companies Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealthcare, allegedly created the financial incentives that increased the price.</p>\n                <p>The companies are being sued for fraudulent concealment, violating Pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment.</p>\n                <p>Insulin prices have been quickly increasing over the last twenty years, however, the process of manufacturing the drug has decreased, according to court documents. In 1990, a vial cost as little as $2 to produce, and was priced at $20. Now, the same vials range anywhere from $300 to over $700. The relevant period for the alleged claims is 2008 through the present.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 continuous contacts and conduct within the Commonwealth established a strong nexus among defendants, this forum and the claims at issue, making the exercise of jurisdiction proper and fair.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 listed above were active in Pennsylvania, and their actions directly impacted residents, so the case is to be handled by a court and a requested jury.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 listed above were actively selling insulin in Pennsylvania, and their actions directly impacted residents, including those at the Pennsylvania State University. Penn State demands trial by jury on all issues that are triable.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is seeking restitution and damages, among other legal and equitable monetary remedies available under the state laws.</p>\n                <p>The university declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.</p>\n                <p>MORE CRIME AND COURTS COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | Lost in Translation: The issues with book-to-film adaptations",
    "author": "Emma Strickling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Since it was released in late November, \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has snowballed into the sensation that it is today. Whether you\u2019ve seen it or not, you\u2019ve probably come across some aspect of the hockey romance online. But before it became such a worldwide phenomenon, its story was housed in the 368-page book of the same title written by Rachel Reid.</p>\n                <p>Whether there\u2019s a creative drought or not, Hollywood has always seemed to turn to their local library to find their latest project. Adaptations have been part of the movie industry since the beginning of film\u2019s history. Today, it\u2019s no different. Academy Award-nominated films \u201cHamnet\u201d and \u201cFrankenstein\u201d, which were released last year, both came from books.</p>\n                <p>Emerald Fennell\u2019s controversial adaptation of \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d will be released next month. The trailer of the movie suggests the film will frame the story as an erotic romance rather than focusing on the intensity, obsession, and at times cruelty that\u2019s present in Emily Bronte\u2019s novel.</p>\n                <p>Even the film\u2019s depiction of Heathcliff based on the casting choice, seems to directly contrast with the descriptions established within the book.</p>\n                <p>Evidently, book-to-movie adaptations can be difficult. But if the base story already exists, why is it so hard to produce a good adaptation?</p>\n                <p>I think, primarily, it lies within the film industry\u2019s fondness for capitalizing on stories that already exist. A recent survey revealed 63% of Americans are more likely to see a movie if it was based on a successful book, according to People Magazine. Basically, these adaptations are an easy way to make money, because people are familiar with the name.</p>\n                <p>With a well-known name comes expectations surrounding the film. People are going to want to see the characters in the world that has been described to them. However, creative control (and perhaps some arrogance as well) can end up steering the project further and further away from its origins, in an attempt at making the film something more palatable for the screen.</p>\n                <p>For those who aren\u2019t familiar with the original, it doesn\u2019t make much difference. But for those who are familiar, they end up feeling disappointed, repeating their mantra of \u201cthe book was better\u201d on the way out of the theater.</p>\n                <p>Time constraints don\u2019t help either. Generally speaking, the average book is around 200-400 pages, which is difficult to try and fit into a two-hour time frame. This leads to important plot lines being cut, leaving viewers feeling like something is missing.</p>\n                <p>This issue is probably why we\u2019re seeing more books turn into TV shows, which can sometimes be a better alternative to film, as there\u2019s more room to go in-depth into the story.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps these films shouldn\u2019t be solely looked at as \u201cadaptations.\u201d Yes, they are being adapted to fit the screen format. However, they are more of a translation of the source into TV shows or movies. Like any translation, there are versions that translate well and some that don\u2019t, but regardless of whether or not it\u2019s translated well, something will get lost in the process.</p>\n                <p>Tone and nuance are things that can be left omitted, leaving the material unlike the original and not quite right. Even if you read a book that was translated from a different language, it still wouldn\u2019t be exactly the same as the original because there\u2019s no such thing as an exact translation. This is the same for a book to movie adaptations as it\u2019s being translated from one language (literature) into another (film).</p>\n                <p>I caution filmmakers \u2014 because I know they are avid readers of my column \u2014 that, in order to make an adaptation, one must have an incredible familiarity with the source text. While no adaptation is 100% perfect, it could be close if there\u2019s an awareness, understanding and reverence of the book it comes from.</p>\n                <p>While some people aren\u2019t sticklers about every detail being exactly how it\u2019s written, if trying to equate a movie with the book it came from, then the adaptation should be as faithful as possible. If the source material is altered significantly in terms of plot, characters and setting then it shouldn\u2019t attempt to be passed off as a direct version of its origin.</p>\n                <p>While I do love both film and literature, I think their interaction with one another should be much more limited than we have seen and continue to see. Because honestly, how many film versions of one book do we need?</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "title": "\u2018We need to wrestle with it\u2019 | Professors discuss AI usage at Penn State",
    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly integrated into everyday life with virtually every Google search conducted today coming with AI overviews and access to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek not being far behind.</p>\n                <p>Stuart Selber, a professor of English and director of the Program of Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) in the College of Liberal Arts, said academic integrity cases involving AI usage are often \u201cblack-and-white\u201d due to representing a blatant cheating attempt.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe do have people just treating AI like an answering machine, feeding the assignment sheet in and asking for a finished assignment and handing it in,\u201d Selber said.</p>\n                <p>He said there are various AI usage policies across the different academic colleges and that allows professors to make their own decisions regarding how AI can be used in their classroom.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI might have a teacher who teaches in the writing program who wants to ban AI, that's up to them,\u201d Selber said. \u201cI don't think that's a good idea, myself, because I think we should wrestle with it because we're trying to prepare you to wrestle with it in the workplace so we need to wrestle with it in the classroom.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ibukun Osunbunmi, an assistant research professor in the College of Engineering, said it was important for professors to be transparent with their AI usage policies and believed such discussions would cause a reduction in academic integrity violations.</p>\n                <p>When advising a colleague about how AI can be used in their course, Osunbunmi said it was important for students to first learn lesson materials without AI before they are given access to it, as a way to assist in solving complex problems.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI told him one of my mantras that \u2018If you cannot do it without AI, there's no (way) you can verify AI output,\u2019\u201d Osunbunmi, an assessment and instructional support specialist within the Leonhard Center for Enhancement of Engineering Education, said. \u201cI said \u2018Now that your students have mastered the fundamentals, now they know that AI can go wrong. They'll be careful not to use it or, even if they use it, they will check it and they have done it in a safe space where they are being guided.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>Osunbunmi said he\u2019s currently working on a website resource for Penn State faculty to learn about how AI can be used in their courses. He said there needs to be more accessible resources and frequent discussion on how to effectively use AI in higher education.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhy there's some pushback to AI integration is because it's disrupting how we teach, it\u2019s disrupting how we learn,\u201d Osunbumni said. \u201cUltimately, it has a lot of potentials for use but the outcome will be based on deliberate, inflectional design and I perceive it's going to be a collection of people sitting together in a room and having these hardcore conversations.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mark Morrisson said he and several of his colleagues are currently investigating how to broaden the ways students can leverage AI through a Bachelor of Arts to complement existing Bachelor of Science degrees already being taught in the Colleges of Engineering and Information Science and Technology (IST).</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe engineering one is about how to make AI, how to understand AI, and the IST one is more use apps, things like that, but what we wanted to achieve with a BA was thinking more about ethical, social, cultural implications of emerging technologies,\u201d Morrisson, a professor of English, said. \u201cLiberal art students fit this kind of thinking very, very well and so we wanted something that would draw students \u2026 to be thinking more capaciously about how to understand impacts and dynamics of emerging technologies.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said Penn State stands to benefit from providing ways to increase AI literacy among students.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere is a lot of disruption going on right now over AI and there's the kind of Luddite perspective of \u2018Let's just rewind and not use this,\u2019\u201d Morrisson said. \u201cWell, it's not possible to do that anymore so instead, whether just uncritically consuming it or hoping it'll just go away, there's a middle ground which is understanding it and really thinking it through like we do with all education at Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>David Fusco said he instructs his students to use AI as a tool to help them rather than a crutch to rely on.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the world of technology that most of my students end up going into, people are using AI in their technology-based jobs,\u201d Fusco, an associate teaching professor in the College of Information Science and Technology, said. \u201cFrom my own personal experience and the courses I teach, I think it's a disservice to students to not understand how to use AI properly.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said he thinks it important that students learn how to effectively use AI due to it becoming an increasingly necessary skill in several industries.</p>\n                <p>Gregg Rogers, an associate teaching professor of English and PWR\u2019s associate director, said Penn State has a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to teach students about AI so they are both provided with a useful skill and inspired to pursue new ways in which the technology can be applied.</p>\n                <p>He said changes in Penn State\u2019s stances toward AI in recent years is the result of beginning to consider how to overcome its drawbacks \u2014 such as hallucinations, where LLMs generate faulty outputs \u2014 as well as its potential for misuse.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNone of these problems are going to be solved by not looking at it,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWe are all still learning about this thing which is what we're supposed to be doing \u2014 we're a university.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Things haven\u2019t been great in Happy Valley recently, as Penn State endured a cold stretch fitting in magnitude to the nearly two feet of snow that hit the region.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions face Ohio State on Monday, with a whole emphasis on the athletic portion of their student-athlete duties. With both schools canceling classes, the contest against the Buckeyes seems as essential as ever, despite the rivalry implications.</p>\n                <p>Penn State dropped its last six and sits as one of two winless teams in the Big Ten, but the blue and white hit the road to Columbus with a chance to heat up along the way.</p>\n                <p>By the numbers</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and Ohio State excelled in certain areas of play but also have their shortcomings, and they are actually similar in many of those metrics. Obviously, the 13-6 Buckeyes outperform the 9-10 Nittany Lions heavily across most categories, scoring offense, team defense, rebounding and scoring efficiency inside the arc.</p>\n                <p>Despite these stats suggesting Ohio State cruises to victory due to those fundamental advantages, there are also intangibles where Penn State actually holds surprising favorability.</p>\n                <p>Beyond the arc, both are mediocre, if even that, shooters, and have comparable possession and assist averages.</p>\n                <p>Building on where the squads are similar is crucial for Mike Rhoades\u2019 Penn State team to find success, and they can also find optimism in the fact that the blue and white typically generate more steals and turn the ball over less than Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>This metric could result in Penn State opting to press for those turnovers, where it can create an advantage, which actually isn\u2019t a terrible idea. According to Evan Miyakawa\u2019s tempo ratings, they both rank similarly, with Penn State taking the edge and also playing more comfortably in faster-paced games than the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>Player personnel</p>\n                <p>When taking an analytical and literal approach, the Buckeyes again hold the advantage, with only the margins favoring Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Bruce Thornton leads Ohio State behind his over 20 points per game average, joined by two other upperclassmen and sophomore John Mobley Jr., the second-leading scorer, as the Buckeyes top offensive contributors.</p>\n                <p>The scarlet and gray possess a roster efficient at all levels, whether it's just a duo or trio or an overall five-man unit. However, the Nittany Lions, which largely tinkered with starting groups due to injury and a young core, actually possess a more efficient five-man lineup of Freddie Dilione V, Kayden Mingo, Josh Reed, Eli Rice and Ivan Juri\u0107.</p>\n                <p>That's a group for Penn State that Rhoades doesn\u2019t typically appear altogether, with Dilione and Mingo rotating in the backcourt, yet Rhoades may need to change that, as the unit posts a better observed efficiency rating.</p>\n                <p>Oh, hello again</p>\n                <p>Penn State enters Ohio State\u2019s campus for the first time this year, and for most of the roster, the first time.</p>\n                <p>Only Dilione and Dom Stewart returned for Penn State in last year's clash with the Buckeyes in State College, where it received a thumping in Rec Hall. On the contrary, Ohio State retained three starters, but most of its second unit is made up of new arrivals.</p>\n                <p>The player most familiar with this occasion will be former Penn State forward and current Buckeye sixth-year, Puff Johnson, who received a temporary waiver to return to action. Johnson will make his second appearance since his return against his old squad, after playing four minutes in a loss to Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Johnson is a key storyline to watch, and especially how he\u2019s handled by both squads in this one. Ohio State may opt to use his services due to his familiarity with Rhoades\u2019 scheme, while Penn State may know just the way to counter its former star.</p>\n                <p>Both squads face off in a primetime FS1 matchup on Monday at 7:00 p.m., and both have a chance to make a statement. For Penn State, it's to show it isn\u2019t done fighting or improving despite a difficult season.</p>\n                <p>At the same time, Ohio State has a chance to differentiate itself from the middle of the pack in the conference in emphatic fashion.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 8 Penn State began a gauntlet of Big Ten contests Friday night, facing three of the top-five teams in the next trio of series, starting with No. 5 Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>After the Nittany Lions\u2019 dominant 7-2 win in their first meeting with the Badgers, the two were back for a Saturday night rematch at the Kohl Center.</p>\n                <p>Penn State secured the series sweep with a 3-1 comeback win Saturday night.</p>\n                <p>The physicality of Big Ten contests is nothing new.</p>\n                <p>Following a five-penalty first period on Friday night, the blue and white\u2019s rematch with the Badgers began with the same theme.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were first to the power play. Wisconsin\u2019s Jack Horbach laid a high hit on defenseman Nick Fascia, and although immediately reviewed for a major penalty, the forward was only awarded a two-minute minor.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s powerplay came inches from an early score, but a tic-tac-toe passing play captained by Gavin McKenna was eventually stuffed at the doorstep by Wisconsin goaltender Daniel Hauser.</p>\n                <p>The prime opportunity quickly dissolved for the Nittany Lions, and after a bouncing puck was intercepted off forward Matt DiMarsico\u2019s stick, Wisconsin\u2019s Tyson Dyck sent Christian Fitzgerald on a shorthanded breakaway.</p>\n                <p>Fitzgerald snuck his shot through the five-hole of goaltender Kevin Riedler, and gave the Badgers a 1-0 lead just under seven minutes into the first period.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s early momentum stalled after Wisconsin\u2019s goal, and the remaining minutes of the first frame were a back-and-forth effort.</p>\n                <p>With just over a minute to go in the period, the Nittany Lions were given a second chance on the man-advantage after one of the Badgers\u2019 top producers, Quinn Finley, was called for hooking.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white couldn\u2019t get one through as the buzzer rang in the first period.</p>\n                <p>Although starting the middle frame with almost a minute remaining on the power play, Penn State remained scoreless and was still chasing a goal.</p>\n                <p>Like Friday\u2019s matchup, the Nittany Lions began the middle frame trailing the Badgers, but unlike the first meeting, there was no three-goal performance to erase the deficit.</p>\n                <p>The two top-10 ranked teams continued their evenly matched battle. Wisconsin held the slight 11-9 edge in shots, and each had an opportunity on the man-advantage, but neither could capitalize and add to the scoring.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers thought they doubled their lead with about three minutes to go after forward Ryan Botterill found the back of the net, but the officials immediately waived it off for goaltender interference.</p>\n                <p>A challenge by the Wisconsin bench led to a short review, which confirmed a defender colliding with Reidler before the score, and the first-period goal was still the only score heading into the final 20 minutes.</p>\n                <p>After 45 minutes of scoreless play, sophomore JJ Wiebusch found the equalizer for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>The Verona, Wisconsin, native got the Nittany Lions on the board in his hometown arena, after firing a shot from the high slot that found its way through traffic and into the back of the Badgers' net.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white picked up some momentum after Wiebusch\u2019s score, and just over eight minutes later, forward Reese Laubach doubled the lead.</p>\n                <p>An initial shot from DiMarsico sent a rebound out to Laubach, who finished the shot over a diving Hauser, and gave Penn State its first lead of the night with about seven minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions sealed the 3-1 comeback win and series sweep after McKenna potted an empty net goal in the remaining seconds of the third period.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State is back at home hosting No. 2 Michigan State, first slated for a 6 p.m. puck drop at Pegula Ice Arena on Jan. 30, before hitting the ice for the outdoor game at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Escaping frigid State College, Penn State men\u2019s gymnastics competed for the first time at the Sam Mikulak Invitational in Sarasota, Florida, named after the three-time Olympian and six-time U.S. national all-around champion.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions faced off against two collegiate teams, Illinois and Florida Storm, as well as the EVO Senior Men\u2019s Elite Team featuring two former Nittany Lions, Michael Jaroh and Josh Karnes.</p>\n                <p>Despite a still rings rotation which featured the two highest scores in the country this season, the blue and white tied for second with Illinois with a 317.650 behind EVO\u2019s 326.150</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>Brayden Erickson got the meet started on the floor, but was unable to showcase much control on his landings. He had a hop on his opening front double tuck and underrotated his full twisting double back dismount, taking a big step to the front and side for a 13.050.</p>\n                <p>Matt Underhill was cleaner in the second spot. He had small hops throughout, including on his double layout and front double pike, but just a small shuffle on his full twisting double back gave him a 13.550.</p>\n                <p>In his first floor routine of 2026, Luke Esparo put up a big 13.700. He had a hop in the wrong direction on his opening combination front double pike, but stuck his double twist along the side. He was underrotated on his dismount but had a solid effort overall.</p>\n                <p>Shaun Smith closed out the rotation with a flat 13.00 following a bounding step forward on his front double tuck and big hops on his full twisting double layout.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Bobby Alessio opened the rotation with a hit. His entire routine was packed with flair elements, and he managed to fly up into a handstand on his dismount for a 12.850.</p>\n                <p>Ritam Malik followed the redshirt sophomore with a 13.800. He had some form issues with leg separation after his one pommel work, but stayed on the horse and landed his dismount.</p>\n                <p>Ricky Perez kept the momentum moving. He competes in a tricky routine with Russian elements. The freshman was a bit slow to get up to his handstand, but dismounted cleanly for a 13.650.</p>\n                <p>Landson Simpson also put up a hit routine in the anchor position. He was dynamic and quick with his Thomas flairs, flying up to handstand for a season-high 13.850.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Bobby Haberstock opened the rotation with a low 11.550. He had some control issues throughout his strength elements, and then was unable to get his dismount around to his feet, landing on his stomach.</p>\n                <p>Akseli Karsikas got the team back on track with a 13.750. He also stumbled a bit on his dismount, taking a large step forward, but putting it to his feet.</p>\n                <p>Needing a big score, elite rings competitor Underhill came through in a huge way, putting up the best score in the nation so far this season. He was steady throughout, sticking his dismount cold for a massive 14.700.</p>\n                <p>Esparo closed out the rotation with a 14.300, the second-best score in the nation behind his teammate. The junior bent his elbow a bit on his final strength element and took two hops on his dismount, but helped Penn State bounce back after the fall in a big way.</p>\n                <p>At the halfway point, and despite Haberstock\u2019s fall, Penn State skyrocketed to the top of the pack with a 161.850. EVO trailed with a 161.100, followed by Illinois\u2019 160.000 and Florida Storm\u2019s 136.900.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Penn State moved to the vault, where all four gymnasts competed a Tsuk two and a half with varying degrees of success.</p>\n                <p>Kellen Ryan started the rotation with a massive step to the right for a 13.750. Simpson underrotated his vault, sitting it down for a low 12.800.</p>\n                <p>Underhill bounced back with just a small hop on his landing for a 13.800. However, the highlight of the rotation was Smith, who stuck the blind landing cold for a rotation-high and season-high 14.150.</p>\n                <p>Penn State extended its lead over EVO to a full point heading into the final two rotations.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Five</p>\n                <p>Malik led off the parallel bars rotation cleanly. He had a few unnecessary hand movements early and took a big step to the side on his piked dismount, but scored a solid 12.900.</p>\n                <p>Esparo continued his big day for the Nittany Lions with a 13.500 after just a small hop back on his double pike dismount.</p>\n                <p>Kacper Garnczarek competed in the first routine of the day in the third slot. He opened strong but was unable to cleanly hit his handstand after a giant need to adjust both his hands to regain balance. He also took two hops on his double front dismount, which lowered his score to a 13.150.</p>\n                <p>Simpson anchored the rotation cleanly despite a big arch in his final handstand position and a large step forward on his dismount. He scored a 13.700 as Penn State dropped its lead, trailing EVO 269.600-270.500 into the final rotation.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Six</p>\n                <p>Ryan opened the highbar rotation. He caught his Coleman and Kovacs taking a small step forward on his dismount for a 12.750.</p>\n                <p>Esparo was unable to finish his day on a high note. He was too far away from the bar on his Kovacs and was unable to grab it. He caught the rest of his releases but had a huge hop back on his dismount, scoring a low 11.750.</p>\n                <p>Garnczarek got the team back on track with a 12.350. He caught his Coleman but had a big form break late in the routine, separating his legs on top of the bar. However, the senior did stick his dismount.</p>\n                <p>Simpson began his routine, falling the wrong way on his handstand, and then couldn\u2019t regroup in time to grab the bar on his Coleman, suffering a fall. He got back on the bar and finished his routine with a stick, but the damage was done as he scored an 11.200.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State welcomes Illinois to Rec Hall on Sunday, February 1, at 1 p.m. for its THON meet.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State closed out a two-game series against Delaware at 1 p.m on Saturday with its annual Senior Day tradition. Six seniors and a pair of graduate students were honored in lieu of the pre-game starting lineup announcement.</p>\n                <p>Members of the graduating class include captain Tessa Janecke, assistant captains Katelyn Roberts, Mya Vaslet, Leah Stecker, Kendall Butze, Maddy Christian, as well as Taylor Lum and goaltender Katie DeSa.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey're pros,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said. \u201cThe way that they approach everything here, from school to hockey to the community, they do everything the right way. They're super connected. And I think it's a group that, years down the years down the road, will stay connected.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions, regardless of graduation status, showed up to play on the special day. Backed by the supportive Roar Zone, <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/women_hockey/no-4-penn-state-women-s-hockey-utilizes-four-goal-first-period-in-series-sweep/article_1ff8895a-45e9-4859-bbc1-2ae4c40b41f7.html\" target=\"_blank\">Penn State posted a clean 7-0</a> scoreline to sweep the series over the Fightin\u2019 Blue Hens. With this victory, Penn State clinched the AHA Regular Season Championship, improving to 24-4 overall and 17-1 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>And it didn\u2019t take long for the senior class to get moving.</p>\n                <p>In the first period, Janecke tallied a pair of goals that sandwiched Lum\u2019s score. In her last series before heading overseas to play in the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games for Team USA, Janecke lasered a shot through three defenders off the post and into the back of the net 16 seconds into the game, assisted by Christian and Butze.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was really cool that we scored 15 seconds in with those six players on the ice,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThey've obviously had terrific careers, and that was a nice touch for Senior Day, and that got us going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lum scored three minutes later, picking up a bounce off the end boards on a shot by Danica Maynard. She ripped the puck into a wide-open net for her fourth goal of the season, increasing Penn State\u2019s lead to 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Janecke\u2019s second came from the same spot in the high slot for Penn State\u2019s third goal, assisted by Roberts, who sent the primary feed to Janecke.</p>\n                <p>The second period saw Butze and Vaslet linking up to assist on Nicole Hall\u2019s goal to further the gap to 6-0. Although she didn\u2019t score, Vaslet rang a shot off the iron on a breakaway. Janecke had a breakaway of her own, but she was dragged down before she was able to deke.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(The seniors) have been so helpful,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAll of them are so kind and helpful every day. They're an awesome group, and it's not going to be the same without them here next year.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Butze capped off the afternoon in the third period with Penn State\u2019s seventh unanswered goal, when she fired a wrist shot from the point that found an opening over goaltender Mattie Robitzer\u2019s shoulder. Butze\u2019s four-point game puts her at 23 points on the season and 84 in her career, which tied Lyndie Lobdell for Penn State\u2019s all-time assists by a defenseman.</p>\n                <p>DeSa made history as the final horn blared, as her 21st career shutout broke the program-record for all-time shutouts set by Josie Bothun in the 2023-24 season.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(DeSa) was behind Josie at that time, but she stayed the course and exceeded all expectations of her,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe did an amazing job again. Today wasn\u2019t the easiest game; she gets called in in different flurries for her to get called back to lock-in down the stretch.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After falling to Washington 81-65 on Wednesday, Penn State took a trip to Eugene to face Oregon. Both teams entered the game with a chance to break a losing streak: the 7-13 Lady Lions had dropped their last nine, and the Ducks lost their last four, entering at 14-7.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white couldn\u2019t build off its fast start, falling 89-59.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got the party started with a 7-0 scoring run, forcing Oregon coach Kelly Graves to burn a timeout less than two minutes into the game</p>\n                <p>Both teams went scoreless for two minutes after the break, until Sarah Rambus netted a layup for the Ducks\u2019 first points of the game.</p>\n                <p>After a three-pointer from Vit\u00f3ria Santana, the Lady Lions went cold as Oregon turned up the defensive pressure, but the Ducks kept quacking. Graves\u2019 squad went on an 8-0 run to tie the game up at 10 with three minutes to play in the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white ended its scoring drought with a layup from freshman guard Viktoria Ranisavljevic, but nonetheless, Oregon surged to take a 16-12 lead after the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>Both teams traded 5-0 scoring runs to start the second frame, but Avary Cain nailed back-to-back threes to give the Ducks a 28-19 lead heading into the first media timeout.</p>\n                <p>Oregon wasted no time coming out of the pause, with Katie Fiso charging the paint for two points. Fiso\u2019s attempt was quickly matched by T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante to put Penn State\u2019s deficit back to single digits.</p>\n                <p>Rambus and Kiyomi McMiller, each team's leading scorers for the game, seemed to be the only ones able to put the ball in the basket. That was until Ranisavljevic went on a 6-0 run by herself to cut the Ducks\u2019 lead to 38-34 with under a minute left in the quarter.</p>\n                <p>Ari Long nailed a two-point jumper with 30 seconds left, but the Lady Lions were unable to respond, giving Oregon a six-point lead heading into the locker room.</p>\n                <p>It was a sloppy first half, with both teams combining for 11 turnovers. With the absence of Gracie Merkle due to injury, the Ducks were able to net 20 points in the paint in the opening half, as opposed to the blue and white\u2019s 16.</p>\n                <p>Cl\u00e8ante got fouled to start the quarter, but only came away with one free throw. Ehis Etute answered with a quick two on the other end.</p>\n                <p>It was raining threes in Matthew Knight Arena for Oregon in the first portion of the third frame as the Ducks went three-for-three from beyond the arc right before a much-needed timeout was called by coach Carolyn Kieger.</p>\n                <p>Even with a timeout, the quarter remained all Oregon. The Ducks stormed for a 14-0 to take a 61-40 lead with just under four minutes to go in the frame. The run was ended with a two-pointer from McMiller, but momentum remained with the home team.</p>\n                <p>In a nearly flawless third quarter, Oregon outscored Penn State 34-11 to carry a 74-45 lead into the final frame. The Ducks shot 4-for-6 from three-point range and forced the Lady Lions to turn the ball over five times in the third.</p>\n                <p>After a quiet third quarter, McMiller netted the first points of the fourth for the blue and white with a layup. Fiso matched right away on the other end with a drive to the basket.</p>\n                <p>Even after McMillers\u2019 bucket, Penn State continued to struggle finding the hoop, missing four straight field goals and going on a two-minute scoring drought.</p>\n                <p>The drought ended when freshman Nyla McFadden was rewarded two points from the foul line. McFadden went on to score the next four points for the Lady Lions, but Oregon still held a comfortable 82-52 lead with just over five minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>As the clock fell just under two minutes, Kieger used her final timeout with the Ducks up 87-55. McFadden continued to show out in the fourth, with seven of her team-high 15 points coming in the frame.</p>\n                <p>The absence of Merkle was evident as points in the paint continued to plague Penn State. Oregon finished with 50 points from the inside and four Ducks scored in double figures.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Amiya Evans remains listed as out for the Lady Lions.

The second period saw a similar scramble, where Brown attempted to push Blaze, only to have the momentum turned against him.</p>\n                <p>The third period saw Brown go defensive, allowing a takedown and a stall call to bring the match to major-decision territory for Blaze. The Nittany Lion was awarded on final takedown as the buzzer sounded while both men were in an apparent stalemate on the ground, extending the win to 15-3.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 9, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. Dario Lemus (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Much like Friday night, Braeden Davis was working at a faster pace than prior weeks as he took on Dario Lemus. He rushed Lemus and secured the first takedown one minute in. He landed a second takedown a minute later and rode out the frame trying to flip a prone Lemus.</p>\n                <p>After Lemus chose to start the second period on the bottom, Davis held onto him until his riding time crossed over a minute, then took him down again soon after the escape. Davis landed his fourth takedown after prying Lemus\u2019 hands off of his ankle with seconds to spare in the period.</p>\n                <p>Davis got another takedown with a minute remaining and worked on a near fall to secure a tech fall. He couldn\u2019t turn him, but secured a stalling point. However, Lemus escaped with seven seconds to ensure the bout ended as an 18-4 major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 13, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 7 Carter Young (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Carter Young was undefeated in dual matches entering Saturday and was Shayne Van Ness\u2019 toughest matchup of the season.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness started the aggression with an attack, but Young kept Van Ness staggered before reversing the takedown. He locked Van Ness into a cradle and received four-nearfall points before Van Ness escaped. After the first period, Young led Van Ness, 7-1.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness turned the tide in the second period, escaping and launching two quick takedowns to draw even. Two more takedowns in a matter of seconds had Van Ness up 14-10. He kept letting Young escape to launch more attacks. The Nittany Lion led 17-11 after Round 2.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness kept pushing Young down by the neck while on top in the third period, resulting in a stall call. Van Ness got two more takedowns before the clock passed 60 seconds remaining, entering major-decision territory. He finished off a tech fall with 30 seconds left, winning by an absurd score of 31-15.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 18, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Mekhi Neal (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mekhi Neal made the first minute difficult for PJ Duke, scampering away from multiple shot attempts and returned to his feet quickly after getting taken down. It only took Duke five seconds to take Neal down again.</p>\n                <p>One more quick takedown had Neal trapped in a cradle, and with a minute left in the first period, Duke was awarded the pin.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 24, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. AJ Rodrigues (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink took down AJ Rodrigues quickly, and racked up 11-near fall points and over two minutes of riding time before the first period ended. He led 14-0 but appeared upset that he didn\u2019t finish off the tech fall.</p>\n                <p>All he had to do was stand up in the second period to secure the 15-0 victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 29, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Seth Digby (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines was physically in control of Seth Digby throughout this bout, racking up riding time after two takedowns, and spent his time trying to cradle Digby. Haines only led 6-1 at the end of the first, but had two minutes of riding time under his name.</p>\n                <p>Haines got two more takedowns in Period 2, but Digby kept his center of gravity low to the mat, refusing to let Haines turn him for any back points.</p>\n                <p>Digby caught Haines by surprise to take him down at the start of Period 3, but Haines caught another gear after standing back up. Digby went on a defensive stand after that, unsuccessfully trying to keep Haines away from a tech fall. Haines crossed the 15-point threshold with 26 seconds remaining, winning 23-7.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 34, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. Sepanta Ahanj-Elias (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh followed the team trend of landing the first takedown right around the one-minute mark. His second score came via a double-leg slam that thumped Sepanta Ahnaj-Elias down to the mat for the rest of the period.</p>\n                <p>The second period opened with Welsh on the bottom, but he stood up and quickly pinned Ahanj-Elias before the frame reached its midpoint.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 40, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 13 Branson John (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Branson John used his height advantage to fend off Josh Barr for most of the first period, but after John mistimed an attack, Barr seized his leg and landed the first takedown.</p>\n                <p>He got one more takedown in the second period, then picked the ankle once more in the third, and quickly flipped John but over-spun to just miss the pin. Two more takedowns handed Barr the 19-4 victory and Penn State another tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 45, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Joey Schneck (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mirasola got his next takedown one minute into Round 2 and impressively locked a standing cradle on Schneck, dropping him for the pin.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 51, Maryland 0</p>",

Burkhart threw for 20.26m, followed by Sam Engebretson\u2019s 19.32m throw for second place.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s success continued in the men\u2019s 3000-meter as senior Logan Strawser led the way with a personal best 8:08.84.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s 60-meter dash, freshman Lucas Band was the only competitor for the Nittany Lions. However, he earned a personal best 6.90 and qualified for the finals in eighth place, followed by another personal best 6.87 for seventh place in the finals.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Alexandria North continued her success from last weekend in the 400 meters, as she finished fifth with a time of 54.92.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s pole vault, senior Tristan McGarrah neared his season best with a second-place finish with 2.04 meters.</p>\n                <p>While junior Lizzie Schreiber didn\u2019t compete in the long jump, she came back and won the men\u2019s triple jump with a meet-record jump of 12.69m.</p>\n                <p>The women\u2019s shot put saw a pair of personal bests come from Penn State\u2019s two competitors, as sophomore Skye Petrie-Cameron finished third with a throw of 15.58m. Fellow sophomore Sasha Garnett threw 14.97 for fourth place.</p>\n                <p>After Strawser won the 3000m earlier in the day, junior Nick Sloff competed in the elite men\u2019s 3000m, where he broke the school record. Sloff won the race in 7:48.56, breaking the Penn State record by nearly two seconds.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 success continued into the men\u2019s 200m, where Ajani Dwyer won his first 200m of the season with a personal best and No. 2 time in Penn State history of 20.52 \u2014 the current top mark in the NCAA.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wrapped up the action on the field with the men\u2019s shot put, where Brady Mider and Sam Engebretson finished second and third.

    "description": "<p>After suffering a 3-0 sweep to McKendree last night, Penn State got another look at the Bearcats today, hoping to avoid a second-straight loss.</p>\n                <p>It was much of the same on Saturday, though, as the Nittany Lions fell to McKendree 3-1 for a series sweep.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was first on the board after a Miller Trubey service ace opened the scoring. The Nittany Lions went on a 4-0 scoring run until a Miller error got the Bearcats back into it.</p>\n                <p>After trading points back-and-forth, Penn State found itself down 19-14 after a Tyler Tripp kill put McKendree in a prime position to win the first set.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions kept it interesting, but a Bryce Wetjen kill solidified it as the Bearcats captured the first set.</p>\n                <p>It couldn\u2019t have been more different in the early running of the second set, though, as Penn State jumped ahead to an early 8-3 lead. Most of the points came from errors, though Miller, Gabriel Gaige and Sean Harvey recorded kills.</p>\n                <p>A 3-0 Bearcat scoring run forced Mark Pavlik and the Nittany Lions into a timeout, holding a 17-12 advantage.</p>\n                <p>McKendree stuck around, going on another 3-0 scoring run, but Penn State stole the second set, winning 25-19 with the help of another Miller kill.</p>\n                <p>With the match now tied at 1-1, the third set proved to be the tightest of the lot in the early bits with points being traded back and forth, but back-to-back Rolen Lively kills gave the Bearcats a 7-5 lead.</p>\n                <p>The action remained tight, with Penn State fighting for a score, cutting into McKendree\u2019s lead with another Harvey kill that made the blue and white\u2019s deficit just two points.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back kills tied it up for the Nittany Lions at 17 apiece, but the Bearcats just kept putting it together, going on another scoring run to command a 21-18 lead.</p>\n                <p>With the end of the third set in sight, Tripp picked up his 11th kill of the day, which helped McKendree capture the third set 25-22.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was closing in right at the end of the set, with Harvey and Trubey picking up their eighth and ninth kills, but it just wasn\u2019t enough, and the blue and white moved one set closer to a loss.</p>\n                <p>Now closer to suffering a series sweep, the Nittany Lions once again started off the scoring first, and Owen Rose matched a McKendree service ace with one of his own as the third set got off to a flying start.</p>\n                <p>Another Harvey kill, and a Tripp error on the attack made it a 6-5 advantage for the blue and white. Penn State temporarily held a two-point lead, but the play was overturned and ruled a Lively kill, tying it up for the Bearcats at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>A controversial score ruling gave McKendree a 15-11 lead, as the Bearcats were slowly pulling away and getting closer to sweeping the Nittany Lions. Rattled, Penn State used another timeout after a Harvey error.</p>\n                <p>The Bearcats, now putting the hurt on the blue and white, took a 19-15 lead, forcing another Pavlik timeout after a Gaige error.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was drawing dead but stayed alive with a Jaidyn Bethel kill effort, which was matched with another from Harvey and one from freshman Tristan Hassell, who recorded 13 kills against Lewis a week ago.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions closed the gap and worked their deficit down to 21-20 after a Jack Morikawa service error silenced the Bearcat end of the floor.</p>\n                <p>Action was tied up at 24-24, but a Lively kill put McKendree back up in front as the game was coming to a head.</p>\n                <p>The Bearcats kept scoring but Penn State was resilient and not letting things end so easily. The blue and white effort was all for nothing, though, as a Sam Hoskin kill sealed the deal, winning the fourth and final set 28-26 for McKendree.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action this Friday to host No. 3 Hawaii at Rec Hall in the whiteout game.</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s match is scheduled for 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State returned to Pegula Ice Arena for its first home series since November. In a successful welcome back party, the Nittany Lions blanked Delaware 5-0 in Game 1 of the series. This game also marked the first game of senior weekend as eight students were honored throughout the series.</p>\n                <p>A four-goal first period quickly gave the Nittany Lions momentum that they didn\u2019t lose the entire game, leading to a 7-0 win.</p>\n                <p>Coach Jeff Kampersal spoke briefly on the \u201cslow start\u201d following the 5-0 win. Kampersal alluded to the seven games on the road before returning to Pegula. However, the Nittany Lions didn\u2019t take long to get on the board in Game 2 as Tessa Janecke found the net only 16 seconds into the game.</p>\n                <p>The Orangeville, Illinois, native quickly made her way into the offensive zone and ripped a wrist shot through two defensemen. An all-around gritty effort from the senior on senior day.</p>\n                <p>Janecke, along with Nicole Hall, played their last regular season series as they departed for the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>The early scoring didn\u2019t stop there as Danica Maynard took the puck off the faceoff and shot a pass that bounced off the end boards and right onto Taylor Lum\u2019s stick. Lum didn\u2019t hesitate to bury the puck into the wide-open net.</p>\n                <p>This was Lum\u2019s fourth goal of the season and a senior\u2019s second of the game.</p>\n                <p>Abby Stonehouse had a perfect chance to add to the 2-0 lead as she was all alone with the goalie at the top of the crease. However, Mattie Robitzer decided this was a great time to flash the leather as she robbed Stonehouse with her glove.</p>\n                <p>Janecke wasn\u2019t finished in the opening period as Penn State was on the power play. The senior took advantage after a wrist shot from the high slot quickly found the net.</p>\n                <p>Stonehouse quickly followed suit as she intercepted a shot in front of the net from Katelyn Roberts. The Blenheim, Ontario, native went from her forehand to backhand and beat Robitzer.</p>\n                <p>Although Penn State found success in the goal department, the opening period came to a close with it on the penalty kill.</p>\n                <p>Second-line magic opened the second period for Penn State. Mikah Keller sent a pass to Grace Outer from below the red line. Outwater took quick work of the puck as she found an opening in the top-right corner.</p>\n                <p>Nicole Hall then joined Janecke as olympians to score in this game as she sent a wrist shot from the high slot that was zipped by Robitzer.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions spent the majority of the second period in its offensive zone, however they were caught being too aggressive at times. Both Janecke and Hall spent time in the penalty box for being a little too aggressive on the boards. The penalty kill for Penn State took this middle frame to shine as it killed both penalties.</p>\n                <p>The third period saw a slower tempo in its first 10 minutes as both teams had opportunities to add to the scoreboard. That was until Kendall Butze sent a slapshot from the point that found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>Tempers began to flare after a heavy hit was laid on Outwater at center ice. The Picton, Ontario, native didn\u2019t take too kindly to the hit and laid a return bodycheck post-whistle.

    "description": "<p>With a winter storm warning ahead, Penn State brought a storm of its own to Rec Hall Saturday with its highest score this season.</p>\n                <p>Putting up an elite-level day, the Nittany Lions beat Maryland 197.250-196.675.</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions managed a big 49.150 on vault to open the meet, courtesy of senior Ava Piedrahita\u2019s massive 9.900 in the anchor position on her unique half on, pike off.</p>\n                <p>Elizabeth Leary got the rotation off on the right foot with a stuck Yurchenko full for a 9.825. Allison Kaempfer was another standout in the rotation, scoring a career-high 9.850 on her Yuchenko 1.5, no longer struggling with under rotation.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Ava Cash got her chance, scoring a solid 9.800 on her Yurchenko full with a hop back. Jessica Johanson and Dani Latronica each struggled a bit, dipping below the 9.800 mark with a 9.725 and 9.775, with some hops on the landings.</p>\n                <p>However, with Johanson\u2019s score dropping, the blue and white took an early, but small .075 lead.</p>\n                <p>On the bars, Maryland was solid, only counting one score below the 9.800-plus range. The highlight of the rotation was Aine Reade\u2019s 9.850; however, without a big 9.900, the Terps had some catching up to do.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Penn State gave the fans in Rec Hall a show to watch on the bars, scoring a huge 49.450 to extend its lead over Maryland to 98.600-98.050 at the halfway point.</p>\n                <p>Ellie Monahan opened the rotation off with 9.850. She nailed her handstands throughout and stuck her full twisting double back dismount to get the team started. Johanson was short on her pirouette handstand on the low bar and took a hop back on her double layout, scoring a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>In the third slot, Leary got the scores rising again. Nailing her release sequence and sticking her double back dismount, she managed a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>Cash followed her with another 9.875. She got a beautiful height on her piked jaegar. She was short on her final handstand, but as the sticky feet were contagious, she nailed her dismount as well.</p>\n                <p>Piedrahita tied her own score from the vault with another 9.900 and a stuck landing, paving the way for the event-winner Latronica.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore anchor put up a massive 9.950 in the anchor position. Her piked jaeger was massive, and she hit her overshoot to handstand right on top of the bar. Keeping up with her teammates, she stuck her landing.</p>\n                <p>On the vault, Maryland could not keep up with Penn State\u2019s pace. The Terrapins managed only one vault better than a 9.800 courtesy of Taylor Rech\u2019s 9.850. Maryland opened the door for Penn State to extend its lead and the Nittany Lions did just that.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Penn State was unable to keep the same momentum on bars, but put together a solid rotation on beam with a 49.175. Monahan kicked things off with a huge routine. Nailing her front-toss combination and sticking her 1.5 dismount for a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Kramer kept the steady performance going with her back handspring back layout acro series and another stuck dismount to improve on her two previous 9.775s with a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Maul began the string of triple acro series off with a bang. She was slightly underrotated on her dismount, having to take a hop in the wrong direction, which dipped her score to a 9.775</p>\n                <p>Kalea McElligott got the scores back on track with a 9.825 courtesy of her triple series, followed by a stuck dismount.</p>\n                <p>Leary had a big wobble on her series. She took a small hop on her dismount as well, finishing off a shaky routine with a low 9.675.</p>\n                <p>Latronica, with pressure to drop the 9.75, ended the rotation on a high note. Nailing her series and difficult leaps, the sophomore stuck her gainer full to bounce back with a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>On the floor, Maryland got its momentum back in a huge way. Madeline Komoroski and Reade both had an event-winning 9.975, meaning one judge gave them each a perfect 10.0. That massive score alongside a few other 9.900s helped Maryland put up a 49.575 on the event to cut Penn State\u2019s lead down to 147.775-147.625.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>With the Terrapins on their heels, the Nittany Lions managed to score a 49.475 on the floor to keep them at bay.</p>\n                <p>Maul, the usual leadoff, brought big energy to open the rotation with a solid two passes, including a strong double back for a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Monahan had too much momentum on her front double full, not fully controlling her lunge forward. She reeled in the power on her second pass for a matching 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Bella Misiura opened her only routine of the day with another front double full and a really controlled landing on her second pass to begin building the scores with a 9.900.</p>\n                <p>Johanson struggled on her double pike, landing a bit straight-legged for a pogo-stick-type hop but cleaned up the landing on her second pass for a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Not to be outdone, Kramer showcased control on both of her passes to manage a 9.975 of her own to a co-champion of the event alongside Komoroski and Reade.</p>\n                <p>Having already clinched the win, McElligott only widened Penn State\u2019s victory. Her 9.900 capped off an incredible day for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Maryland was solid on the beam, but with no massive 9.900+ scores, the Terrapins were unable to carry their momentum into a win.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After shutting out Indiana inside of Rec Hall on Friday, No. 1 Penn State faces a quick turnaround to College Park, Maryland, for a Saturday evening showdown with the No. 29 Terrapins.</p>\n                <p>The dual was originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon, but due to the impending arrival of Winter Storm Fern, the contest at the Schanwald Center was moved to 5 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>As a result of the rescheduling, the broadcast has been moved from Big Ten Network to Big Ten Plus, which is free to watch all weekend throughout the snowstorm.</p>\n                <p>Maryland is a similar opponent to Indiana in that it\u2019s a lower-tier Big Ten opponent that a Penn State lineup, featuring six No. 1 wrestlers, should be expected to cruise through in time to beat the snow back to State College.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. Presden Sanchez (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Both Luke Lilledahl and Presden Sanchez are coming off matches with Indiana\u2019s Jacob Moran. Sanchez suffered a tech fall in his bout, while Lilledahl secured a pin.</p>\n                <p>Sanchez is 0-4 in his redshirt freshman campaign while Lilledahl doesn\u2019t have an official loss on his record this season. Lilledahl should make quick work of the opening match.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 15 Braxton Brown (UMD)</p>\n                <p>One of three ranked matches on the card sees freshman sensation Marcus Blaze challenge three-time NCAA qualifier Braxton Brown.</p>\n                <p>Brown is 13-4 on the season, but none of his wins have come against top-16 opponents. Blaze is arguably the best competition he\u2019s faced this season.</p>\n                <p>Blaze is looking to continue his perfect season against Brown. The freshman is 3-0 with two-bonus point matches against opponents ranked higher than Brown this season.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. Dario Lemus (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Similarly to Brown, Dario Lemus has yet to defeat a top-16 opponent this season. Lemus is 12-7 and is on pace for his first year wrestling attached with a record above .500.</p>\n                <p>However, Braeden Davis has been improving rapidly since returning to the lineup for Penn State and scored 24 points in a victory on Friday. Davis should control the pace in this match.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 7 Carter Young (UMD)</p>\n                <p>The highest ranked match of the dual comes at 149 pounds between Shayne Van Ness and Carter Young. This is the only top-10 match on the card.</p>\n                <p>Young transferred into Maryland from Oklahoma State after going 10-10 in his first season under head coach David Taylor. He has upped his output to an 8-1 record in 2025-26.</p>\n                <p>Young has also beat both top-16 competitors he\u2019s faced and now tests himself against the top-ranked athlete in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness is undefeated on the season, but Young is a higher level of competition than he has faced. Van Ness\u2019 pace can be matched by Young, so expect a lower-scoring match than Van Ness is accustomed to.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Michael Pizzuto (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Michael Pizzuto is a redshirt sophomore with multiple accolades off the mat, including academic all-Big Ten honors. However, on the mat, Pizzuto is .500 in his collegiate career and hasn\u2019t shown the ability to compete with world-class opponents.</p>\n                <p>Duke is just that, especially after receiving his World Championship ring on Friday from USA wrestling after competing in the U20 World Championship event this past summer. His last two matches have ended prior to the third round and that trend should continue against Maryland.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. AJ Rodriguez (UMD)</p>\n                <p>What more needs to be said about Mitchell Mesenbrink other than he is a bonus-point machine. He secured a pin on Friday night and will look to match that effort Saturday.</p>\n                <p>AJ Rodriguez is another Terrapin whose record is floating narrowly above an even showing and has yet to face a top-20 opponent. Mesenbrink will be an evening wake up call for Rodriguez.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Seth Digby (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Continuing up Penn state\u2019s murderers row is another mismatch for U23 World Champion Levi Haines. Haines hasn\u2019t lost since last season\u2019s NCAA finals, and 2-7 freshman Seth Digby isn\u2019t likely to break that trend.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. Sepanta Ahanj-Elias (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Another freshman for the Terrapins, Sepanta Ahanj-Elias bounces between 184 and 197 for Maryland. Going up against the No. 1 in a weight class that involves a heavy cut is a bad sign for the red singlet.</p>\n                <p>Ahnaj-Elias is coming off of a major-decision loss to Sam Goin, who Rocco Welsh defeated on Friday. Welsh should have an easy Saturday retaining his No. 1 spot.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 13 Branson John (UMD)</p>\n                <p>This match features more intrigue than expected at the start of the year, as Branson John has become Maryland\u2019s most improved competitor this season.</p>\n                <p>After scratching into the NCAA tournament last season, John is firmly in contention with a 19-3 record. While he doesn\u2019t have any major victories on his record, he has won via bonus points in half of his matches this year.</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr immediately regained his No. 1 ranking since returning and has been churning ever since. He\u2019s seen close matchups as of late and this has the makings of another tense affair.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Joey Schneck (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Closing out the dual will be Cole Mirasola against Joey Schneck. So far, every time Mirasola faces an unranked opponent, he completes the job in the blink of an eye. Schneck fits that mold perfectly at 5-5.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola shouldn\u2019t struggle against Schneck.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

Samoskevich served as an assistant for two seasons from 2020 to 2022.</p>\n                <p>Never one to take the spotlight, the Beverly, Massachusetts, native revealed that he took a dive to see how many games players from the graduating class of 2026, such as Katelyn Roberts and Tessa Janecke, won during their time in the blue-and-white, an appropriate statistic to research on the eve of Saturday\u2019s \u201cSenior Day\u201d festivities.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to tap them on the shoulders and tell them to go out there and they\u2019re good,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cOur bus of players when they show up is usually better than the other bus of players.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In total, Kampersal has led this group of seniors to 103 wins thus far with still seven regular-season games remaining, plus the AHA conference tournament and NCAA women\u2019s ice hockey tournament.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lion coach is known for making the right decisions, with one of those decisions being the formation of the second line: Maddy Christian, Mikah Keller and Grace Outwater.

    "description": "<p>Braeden Davis is a man of few words when it comes to speaking into a microphone \u2014 Davis prefers to do his talking on the mat.</p>\n                <p>He did just that in Penn State\u2019s dual against Indiana Friday, dropping 24 points in a major-decision victory over No. 25 Henry Porter. The Hoosier scored 10 points against Davis, keeping him one point shy of a tech-fall finish, but Davis didn\u2019t let the takedown shake his focus on the mat.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been taught that if something goes bad, just go and score another takedown,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t get thrown on my back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Porter offered Davis a modicum of adversity, it was not a worry compared to the treacherous path the junior has walked this season. He\u2019s the only Nittany Lion to have taken a loss in their last six dual matches.</p>\n                <p>That loss came to Iowa\u2019s Nasir Bailey, a loss decided by one point, and in which Davis was seconds away from earning that point via riding time or stalling calls.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a fine line between winning and losing,\u201d Cael Sanderson said on Tuesday. \u201c(Davis) will just keep getting better as we move forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Davis walked to the mat Friday, his new walkout song, \u201cBawitadaba\u201d by Kid Rock, didn\u2019t become audible until the final seconds before his match began, a fitting metaphor for a late-onset season for the defending All-American.</p>\n                <p>At the start of Penn State\u2019s season, Davis was notified he\u2019d be redshirting. Following an offseason that saw Davis mired in <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/news/crime_courts/penn-state-wrestler-faces-criminal-charges-after-incident-outside-tau-kappa-epsilon/article_86091be1-8f50-4aff-86fd-63d4b242353c.html\" target=\"_blank\">off-mat controversy,</a> the additions of Marcus Blaze, Masanosuke Ono and the return of Aaron Nagao, Davis was the odd man out of the lineup.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere was a little bit of confusion at the start of the year but it feels good.\u201d Davis said about returning to the lineup.</p>\n                <p>Davis admittedly didn\u2019t manage his weight with intention during the month-long period where he wasn\u2019t expecting to compete. He only competed at the Kauffman Open in January to start the year. The Belleville, Michigan, native went 4-0 to win the tournament.</p>\n                <p>That week, Davis learned he would burn his expected redshirt after Nagao once again suffered a season-ending injury. Then the work started to get back into starting lineup worthy condition.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAt the time, I thought I was redshirting, so what do you expect?\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo no, I definitely didn\u2019t (manage weight) the best.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson didn't hesitate to give his trusted lightweight the opportunity to hold his spot knowing that Nagao wasn\u2019t likely to return this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe kinda just threw him right in there and that decision is made as he\u2019s a competitor,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe will just keep rolling with things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Getting in shape was easier for Davis than in past years as he moved closer to his natural weight. As a freshman, Davis wrestled down weight at 125 pounds, then bumped up to 133 pounds last season. Weight management is easier for the junior as he bumps up again into the 141-pound slot.</p>\n                <p>Davis\u2019 pace has continued to improve as he works his way deeper into the season, peaking Friday with an eight-takedown performance against Porter. Rec Hall gave Davis a resounding ovation as he left the mat for his largest win of the season. The moment represented Davis finding his place back in Penn State\u2019s starting lineup and finding his comfort in a fluctuating season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a little bit of a challenge at first, but now that I\u2019m down to my normal shape, it\u2019s quite comfortable.\u201d Davis said. \u201c(141-pounds) is probably the most comfortable out of all the weight classes I\u2019ve wrestled so far.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mitchell Mesenbrink pumped his fist toward the crowd after winning via pin. After Braeden Davis\u2019 commanding 24-10 victory by major decision, he was greeted by Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics Pat Kraft, who gave him an emphatic high five with his left hand.</p>\n                <p>It was a commanding 48-0 win for Penn State over Indiana to make it 81 straight wins in dual matches, but for Cael Sanderson\u2019s squad, it was another day in the office.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe enjoy competing, and each individual's working on what they do and getting better in each match,\u201d Cael Sanderson said. \u201cEvery time you step out there, it's an opportunity to compete and do something you love, and then also continue to get better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>At intermission, Penn State had eight of its nine wrestlers receive championship rings from suiting up for Team USA this past summer in the U23 and U20 World Championships. Mesenbrink was the lone Nittany Lion who didn\u2019t partake in the ceremony, as his bout was up next coming out of the half.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson often preaches how the goal for his wrestlers is to succeed beyond the collegiate stage. The success at the international level this past summer proved just that.</p>\n                <p>But then it again, it carries over to when his wrestlers suit up in the blue and white singlets. Entering the weekend Penn State had six guys ranked No. 1 in the InterMat rankings, but those top spots don\u2019t really matter to Sanderson.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we have a strong team, obviously, a lot of good kids,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe don't really focus or worry or think too much about rankings, right? It's the same boring process of getting better every day and every competition and remain grateful for the opportunities that we have, and all those other things will take care of themselves.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With the win over the Hoosiers, Penn State moved to 10-0 on the year and 4-0 in Big Ten play. It was a dominant showing in front of a Rec Hall crowd that had over 6,200 people show up draped head to toe in the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said Indiana was \u201cscrappy.\u201d The No. 25 Hoosiers ended up recording more takedowns than what No. 4 Iowa recorded against the Nittany Lions a week ago, but Penn State still ended up with bonus points in nine of the 10 victories.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey came out fighting, so it was good for us, and it's good that our guys were able to score a lot of points,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI think when you enjoy what you're doing, points are obviously a good thing, and it's good training and conditioning.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action on Saturday to face Maryland in College Park, as pending snowstorms had the dual moved from Sunday. Sanderson said wrestling in consecutive days will be great preparation for the postseason, where the wrestlers will have to do just that.</p>\n                <p>After blowing out Indiana, the Nittany Lions will face a similar caliber opponent in the Terrapins. Despite blowing out the Hoosiers, and the outcome likely to be very similar against Maryland, Sanderson is expecting his squad to fine-tune mistakes from Friday as it hits the road.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s to be expected from a coach who has led Penn State to 12 national titles as a head coach, because finding miscues in a 48-0 victory is what it takes to create a dynasty like he has.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe weren't at our best at every weight, but we're excited to keep pushing forward here and get right back on the mat,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State hasn\u2019t played a home series since November of last year. What happened in that game, you may ask? Second line dominance from the three forwards: Maddy Christian, Mikah Keller and Grace Outwater.</p>\n                <p>In their return to Pegula Ice Arena, the forwards continued to shine as three of the five goals for the Nittany Lions came from the second line. The three forwards scored a goal apiece while racking up their points through assists. Ultimately, the line as a whole produced six total points in a 5-0 conference victory over Delaware</p>\n                <p>What makes a line continue production like they have, falls on the players doing their respective parts on a continuous basis. This is seen nearly every shift, especially from their coach, Jeff Kampersal.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMaddy (Christian) has speed and the same skill, Mikah (Keller) has the vision, Grace (Outwater) scores goals and you don\u2019t have to tell her twice to shoot,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThey are going to carry the load moving forward for sure.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Kampersal describes how each player contributes to a talented forward trio, it paints the picture of a three-headed monster. A unit's defensemen don\u2019t want to see skating down the ice on a forecheck.</p>\n                <p>The three have been grouped together for nearly the whole season. Due to this, their chemistry has evolved into bonds never forgotten. As seniors soon depart, such as Christian, forming a bond with her teammates gives her the utmost gratitude as she is more than halfway done with her season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAs a senior, knowing that I have this group, I love it because I know I feel like we all just chem together,\u201d Christian said. \u201cWe all have our different attributes that make us great, and it\u2019s heartwarming to know that I\u2019m there for Mikah and Mikah is there for Grace.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The idea of all three forwards being there for each other was portrayed in a two-on-one opportunity for Outwater and Christian in the game against the Blue Hens. As Outwater received a pass from Leah Stecker from the other end of the ice, it was up to the Picton, Ontario, native to shoot the puck herself or feed a pass to her linemate for the fourth goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>With both possibilities playing in her mind, the forward dished the puck across the crease for a wrist shot from Christian that gave the Nittany Lions a 4-0 lead late in the second period. As testament to the trio being there for each other, Outwater revealed her mindset as she got closer to the net.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was the perfect opportunity to shoot, and then last second I saw Maddy, and I was like \u2018oh my gosh, pass it,\u2019\u201d Outwater said. \u201cShe got it, and it was a really good goal. So, it was nice.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky cited his team\u2019s fast starts as a key to its five-game winning streak. His group had scored first in four of its last five games.</p>\n                <p>The No. 8 Nittany Lions\u2019 start to Friday\u2019s contest at the Kohl Center was anything but fast after three first-period penalties put them in an early hole. But behind a pair of hat tricks from Dane Dowiak and Gavin McKenna, plus 39 saves from Josh Fleming, Penn State scored seven unanswered goals to stun No. 5 Wisconsin, 7-2.</p>\n                <p>The comeback victory marked the longest Big Ten winning streak in program history, according to the Big Ten Plus broadcast.</p>\n                <p>Alex Servagno started the game in the penalty box after Penn State\u2019s warm-up infraction. And after Nolan Collins played a puck with a broken stick, the Nittany Lions were down two men just one minute into the period.</p>\n                <p>Enter Fleming, a 2026 Hobey Baker Award nominee, who denied two point-blank chances to keep the game scoreless.</p>\n                <p>Shea Van Olm, who returned from a four-game absence, checked a Wisconsin forward from behind and into the boards. The freshman forward was handed a five-minute major and a game misconduct, which ended his return after just 10 minutes.</p>\n                <p>And while Fleming\u2019s heroism held the Badgers scoreless on their first power play, his first blunder awaited on the ensuing penalty kill. The freshman goaltender denied Tyson Dyck\u2019s initial shot but failed to corral the rebound, which Dyck tapped home for a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Oliver Tulk later sniped a shot past Fleming\u2019s blocker to make it two Wisconsin tallies on its lengthy power play. The Badgers led 18-4 in shots and held a 2-0 advantage at the first intermission \u2014 a lead that could\u2019ve been extended if not for Fleming\u2019s 16 saves.</p>\n                <p>Fleming\u2019s resolve was rewarded two minutes into the second period when Mac Gadowsky backhanded a slot feed to Dowiak, who snapped it top shelf to cut Penn State\u2019s deficit in half. It was a one-score game despite Wisconsin\u2019s 22-7 shots advantage.</p>\n                <p>Following interference and cross-checking calls on the Badgers, it was Penn State\u2019s turn on the 5-on-3. And like its opponent, the Nittany Lions struck twice.</p>\n                <p>McKenna struck first when he skated patiently into the slot before rifling a wrist shot through traffic for his seventh goal of the season. Dowiak followed with a rebound tally, his second goal of the contest, to give Penn State a 3-2 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Shots were 18-18 in the second period. The difference: Fleming stopped all 18 to give himself 34 saves entering the final period.</p>\n                <p>After an abysmal start, the Nittany Lions had silenced the Kohl Center crowd, which went from quiet to stunned when Jackson Smith scored 15 seconds into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Standing near the blue line, the heavy-hitting defenseman threw a wrist shot on goal, hoping to get a deflection and nothing more. But the traffic blocked Daniel Hauser\u2019s vision, and Smith\u2019s shot hit the net to give Penn State a 4-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Smith\u2019s tally provided some insurance, but McKenna wasn\u2019t satisfied. At the halfway point of the period, Penn State\u2019s No. 72 again skated patiently into the offensive zone, this time wristing a shot far side and beyond Hauser\u2019s outstretched blocker for his second goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>Dowiak seemingly took exception to McKenna matching his goal total and raised him one better when he poked a loose puck between Hauser\u2019s five-hole to complete his hat trick. Fleming\u2019s acrobatic pad save to spark Dowiak\u2019s shorthanded tally was a fitting close to a dominant final two periods for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>McKenna added a late tally to complete his first collegiate hat trick, as the Nittany Lions improved to 17-6 and extended their winning streak to six games.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

The Nittany Lions hosted No. 25 Indiana in the historic venue as part of another two-dual weekend.</p>\n                <p>It was all Penn State from the start, as the Nittany Lions took down the Hoosiers, 48-0, winning nine of the ten matches by bonus points.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how each matchup went down.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 12 Jacob Moran (IU)</p>\n                <p>The last time the two wrestlers met was on Nov. 5, 2022, where Jacob Moran came out on top with a 6-5 decision at the Black Knight Invitational.</p>\n                <p>This time, Luke Lilledahl got the best of Moran, as after multiple takedowns, the Nittany Lion managed to put Moran on his back. Lilledahl got the four swipes from the official, and put both shoulders down for the pinfall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State began with a 6-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. Blaine Frazier (IU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze went on the attack early and often against the unranked Blaine Frazier, leading the match 9-2 after the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>Blaze held over a minute of riding time and added onto it in the second period with two additional takedowns. One final takedown was all Blaze needed to end the match, earning the tech fall at the 5:44 mark.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s lead extended to 11-0.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 25 Henry Porter (IU)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis gave up the first takedown of the match, but quickly responded with a takedown of his own to overtake the lead with a 4-3 score just over a minute into the match.</p>\n                <p>Davis continued his aggression after another takedown to lead 7-5 after the first period. The Belleville, Michigan, native proved his ability to ride on top, putting up over two minutes of riding time after the second period.</p>\n                <p>With a 22-9 lead, and just nine seconds remaining, Davis opted for neutral positioning in a tech-fall attempt. Despite not getting the takedown, Porter received another stalling warning, awarding Davis another point. With over three minutes of riding time, Davis secured another point, winning by major decision, 24-10.</p>\n                <p>Davis\u2019 major decision put Penn State up 15-0.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. Joey Buttler (IU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness consistently pushed for a fall in his match against Joey Buttler. Van Ness\u2019 two takedowns and four-nearfall points gave him a 10-1 lead after one period.</p>\n                <p>After an escape point for Buttler in the second period, Van Ness went back on the attack in the third. A takedown with 15 seconds remaining ended the match, giving the Nittany Lion a tech-fall win.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness\u2019 tech fall at 6:45 put Penn State up 20-0.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Bryce Lowery (IU)</p>\n                <p>Keeping up with the aggressive mindset, PJ Duke notched his first takedown within seconds of the match beginning. A highly offensive first period saw Duke earn six takedowns en route to an 18-5 lead with 1:36 of riding time.</p>\n                <p>A seventh takedown 16 seconds into the second period ended things, as Duke won 21-5 by tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State entered the intermission with a 25-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 19 Tyler Lillard (IU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink continued to show emphasis on back points and fall attempts. Against Tyler Lillard, Mesenbrink tried not once, not twice, but three times to get the fall over Lillard.</p>\n                <p>The third time was the charm, as Mesenbrink would\u2019ve had the tech fall, but instead got both shoulders on the ground for the fall at 4:01.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s rout continued with a 31-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Orlando Cruz (IU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines showcased why he\u2019s the top wrestler at 174 pounds once again. In his match against Orlando Cruz, Haines led 7-0 with a takedown and four-nearfall points after the opening period.</p>\n                <p>He continued on the offensive, leading 11-0 after two periods and finished things off with two takedowns in the third period. A tech fall at 6:26 ended the match early with another bonus-point win.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions led 36-0.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 15 Sam Goin (IU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh put together another aggressive and offensive performance in his match against Sam Goin.</p>\n                <p>Welsh held a 10-2 lead after the first period before extending it in the second with a takedown. Despite the big lead, Welsh conceded a takedown, closing the gap slightly. Goin added a second takedown as time was ticking down, giving him an opportunity to win.</p>\n                <p>Goin\u2019s attempt at nearfall points was unsuccessful and Welsh held on to the victory with a 15-9 decision. It was the first non-bonus point victory for the Nittany Lions in the dual.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s lead pushed to 39-0.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 14 Gabe Sollars (IU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr secured his first takedown in the first minute after a scramble allowed him to get behind Gabe Sollars.</p>\n                <p>Holding a 3-1 lead, Barr extended it to 7-2 in the second period before extending it even more in the third. Despite multiple caution calls prior to the match resuming and a stalling call against Barr that left Rec Hall unhappy, Barr came out on top, winning the match 14-6 by major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 43-0 with just one match remaining.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Caleb Marzolino (IU)</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola faced a similar sized wrestler in Caleb Marzolino. In the match, Mirasola secured takedown after takedown in the first period, proving his aggression.</p>\n                <p>Seven takedowns in the opening period forced Marzolino to get up, which ended things early. A tech fall at the 2:46 mark ended the dual with another Penn State shutout.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions by a 48-0 score, dominating each match.</p>",

    "author": "Keira Albert | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 10 Penn State took its first loss of the season against No. 15 McKendree in a 3-0 sweep from the Melvin Price Convocation Center in Lebanon, Illinois.</p>\n                <p>The first set started with a few back-and-forth points, several of which resulted from service errors on both ends of the court. Penn State had a rocky start, but an Owen Rose service ace tied the score at 9-9.</p>\n                <p>While McKendree was able to score quick back-to-back points to take a brief lead, a huge block from Gaige Gabriel brought the blue and white back into it. After a few quick points, it was tied at 13-13.</p>\n                <p>The first set continued going back and forth between the remaining few points. Two back-to-back kills from Sean Harvey kept the Nittany Lions neck-and-neck with the Bearcats.</p>\n                <p>At 17-17, a Penn State service error and a huge kill from the opposition gave McKendree a two-point lead. But, a critical kill from Gabriel put the score at 19-18, giving the blue and white a fighting chance with the end of the set approaching.</p>\n                <p>Two attack errors from the blue and white put McKendree up 21-18, forcing the blue and white to take a timeout and regroup. However, another kill from the Bearcats added another point to their lead.</p>\n                <p>With another crucial kill from Gabriel, the blue and white brought out the 7-foot Miller Trubey for a serve, which resulted in another point for Penn State after a Carter Dittman kill.</p>\n                <p>With Penn State closing the lead to 22-20, McKendree took a timeout. But the blue and white seemed to be in its rhythm, as freshman Tristan Hassel opened it up with a huge kill.</p>\n                <p>However, after a few errors on the Nittany Lions\u2019 end of the court, the score got away from them again. At a McKendree set point of 24-22, Penn State was forced to take a second timeout.</p>\n                <p>While Harvey was able to get in a kill, the second set point was won by the Bearcats, making the set final 25-23.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white opened the second set by taking the first point. But McKendree came back immediately and scored four quick points.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were able to briefly close the Bearcats\u2019 lead to 6-4, but a long pause on the court occurred due to an error with the net camera. After it was fixed, the McKendree momentum was broken up, and the blue and white capitalized with two back-to-back points, tying it at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>At 8-8, the Bearcats started to run away with it again, scoring two quick points to make it 10-8 over Penn State. After dominating a couple of points, redshirt freshman Jaidyn Bethel got a huge block to put the blue and white back in it at 13-11.</p>\n                <p>But, after several fast points from McKendree\u2019s half of the court, Penn State called a timeout after trailing by three at 15-12. The break seemed to do some good, as the first point went to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>After a challenged play by the Bearcats\u2019 bench, their lead increased to 18-14. A few more quick points from their side forced another blue and white timeout at 20-15.</p>\n                <p>The timeout wasn\u2019t enough for the blue and white to get back in it, however. While Penn State was able to win one point after the break, McKendree took the second set 25-16.</p>\n                <p>The third set played out similarly with several back-and-forth points on both sides. In the early moments, the blue and white were playing as a tighter unit.</p>\n                <p>After trading points, Penn State took the lead for the first time in several points with an attack error from the Bearcats, making it 13-12. However, three responding points shut down the Penn State momentum, putting the Bearcats back on top.</p>\n                <p>After fighting their way back, the Nittany Lions tied it 17-17 after a service ace from Trubey.</p>\n                <p>After the Bearcats took a significant lead of 22-18, Penn State took a timeout for an attempt at recovery.</p>\n                <p>However, the McKendree momentum was too strong, and the blue and white didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p>\n                <p>While the Nittany Lions were able to prevent the first two match points, one final Bearcats\u2019 kill gave them the victory at 25-20, a clean sweep against the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State\u2019s dominant sprint through the AHA rebounded quickly after its first conference loss to Mercyhurst on Jan. 10, when the Nittany Lions fell in overtime, 3-2. The blue and white pieced together a clean sweep over Syracuse, 4-1 and 3-2, respectively, before taking down No. 12 Cornell, 5-1, on Tuesday to close out a seven-game road trip.</p>\n                <p>To kick off senior weekend at Pegula Ice Arena, Penn State hosted Delaware at 6 p.m on Friday. Coach Jeff Kampersal secured his 500th career win as his Nittany Lions cruised to a 5-0 victory over the Fightin\u2019 Blue Hens.</p>\n                <p>Penn State improved to 23-4 on the season and 16-1 in the AHA. Goaltender Maddy Campbell got the nod and stopped all seven shots she faced in her fourth career shutout, good for tied second in the nation amongst freshmen.</p>\n                <p>From the opening puck-drop, the blue and white surged on offense. Despite having many scoring opportunities, Delaware\u2019s defensemen filled the shot lanes with blocks to halt dangerous plays. However, the pressure accounted for the Hens\u2019 depleted stamina midway through the first period.</p>\n                <p>In the first period alone, the Nittany Lions exceeded Delaware\u2019s entire shot total against Penn State this season of 11. The blue and white entered its locker room outshooting the Hens 13-0, while unable to put the puck in the net.</p>\n                <p>Not for a lack of chances, however, as Katelyn Roberts blazed down the right side wall with six seconds remaining in the opening frame. Roberts fired away, but her shot was saved by the shoulder of freshman netminder Charlotte Payne.</p>\n                <p>Penn State proved that a short intermission was all it needed to break the ice, as Grace Outwater picked up a loose puck on the doorstep and deposited it through a narrow gap between the post and Payne\u2019s extended pad.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions went on the penalty kill for the first time when Mikah Keller took a head-contact penalty with 15:55 remaining in the second period. Campbell saw her first shot of the game on that penalty kill, a leg save in tight on the post that she controlled to the opposite-side corner.</p>\n                <p>Just over a minute into the powerplay, Francesca Barresi took a trip to the sin bin for body checking. Payne stood tall in the net throughout the disadvantage to keep the game within a goal.</p>\n                <p>On offense, Delaware had a golden opportunity to tie the game as Wren Abboud flew down the middle of the ice on a breakaway. Campbell challenged the shooter and made a glove save to maintain a blank slate.</p>\n                <p>With 9:56 left to play in the second period, the Nittany Lions had a second power play opportunity when Suvina Heidt was called off the ice for high sticking.</p>\n                <p>Although the penalty concluded, the pressure continued to exhaust Delaware\u2019s defense. With 6:36 on the clock, Kendall Butze took the puck across the blue line and ripped a shot on-net that found a hole under Payne\u2019s blocker to increase Penn State\u2019s lead to two.</p>\n                <p>And the fireworks didn\u2019t stop. Danica Maynard took a body checking penalty with five minutes remaining, and came out of the box with speed. Her breakaway attempt was thwarted, but she managed to find Keller unmarked in front of the crease, who tapped in Penn State\u2019s third unanswered goal of the night.</p>\n                <p>Less than two minutes later, Grace Outwater and Maddy Christian strode down the ice on a 2-on-1. Outwater dished the puck to her linemate on the left side, who pinpointed the top left corner of the net to take a 4-0 lead going into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Through the early goings of the third period, Penn State faced increased disciplinary action when Tessa Janecke and Taylor Lum were each called for tripping. Regardless, the Nittany Lions cleared each without facing much opposition.</p>\n                <p>Once back at full-strength, Taya MacDonald found herself open along the boards. With 9:03 remaining in the game, she sniped the puck over Payne\u2019s right shoulder to take a 5-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions coasted to the final buzzer, securing their third win this season over the Hens.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to Pegula Ice Arena on Senior Day tomorrow at 2 p.m for Game 2 against Delaware.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s May 2, 2025, the opening game of Penn State\u2019s final regular season series against Washington. Bottom of the seventh inning, down 5-2, the Nittany Lions have runners on first and second with two outs. Brooke Klosowicz steps up to the plate with a chance to do what no other player in program history has done \u2013 record 50 RBIs in a season.</p>\n                <p>The Johnsburg, Illinois, native quickly faced a 1-1 count, but locked and loaded on the third pitch. Klosowicz sent the ball over the center field fence, bringing her season RBI total to 52 for a new program record.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ended up falling to the Huskies 9-5 in nine innings, but nonetheless, it was a momentous day for Klosowicz and the cherry on top of an extraordinary sophomore campaign.</p>\n                <p>In addition to RBIs, Klosowicz also set a single-season program record with 23 doubles. The junior utility player completed the 2025 season with a .422 batting average and .851 slugging percentage, which were both top-10 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Klosowicz led the Nittany Lions with 65 hits, 131 total bases and finished tied for a team-high 13 home runs. All the while, managing to strike out just 11 times.</p>\n                <p>The difference between the beginning of this year and last is that now Klosowicz has plenty of hype surrounding her name. It\u2019ll be hard for the junior to match last season's numbers, but that\u2019s not saying it can\u2019t be done. Klosowicz has proven to be the leader of the Penn State offense and could help lead the team back to the postseason.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look at some of the projected stat lines for Klosowicz before she and the rest of the Nittany Lions gear up for the regular season.</p>\n                <p>Batting average</p>\n                <p>The blue and white will face some tough competition in the circle this year. Five of the arms in D1 Softball\u2019s top-25 preseason pitcher rankings are a part of a staff that Penn State will face, including two of the top three.</p>\n                <p>Klosowicz\u2019s toughest battle will be in the regular season finale when the Nittany Lions host Nebraska. The Cornhuskers are led by the reigning Big Ten Pitcher and Player of the Year, Jordyn Frahm.</p>\n                <p>In the blue and white\u2019s Big Ten Tournament game against Frahm last season, Klosowicz went 0-for-2.</p>\n                <p>Another top arm that Klosowicz will have to face is Tennessee\u2019s Karlyn Pickens, who helped lead the Lady Volunteers to the Women\u2019s College World Series semifinals last season.</p>\n                <p>Given the state of Penn State\u2019s opponents and schedule, I don\u2019t think Klosowicz will put up as high a batting average this season. However, great hitters always find a way to produce, so I still think Klosowicz will finish somewhere around the .350 - .400 range.</p>\n                <p>Hits and RBIs</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions lost last season's second and third RBI producers from 2025, Haylie Brunson and Maddie Gordon, to graduation. It\u2019s due to this that I think Klosowicz will put up similar, if not better, numbers in the hits and RBI categories to lead the Penn State offense.</p>\n                <p>I think it\u2019s a safe bet to make that the junior once again reaches, or breaks the 50 RBI mark. While Klosowicz will be facing some tough arms, I don\u2019t doubt that she\u2019ll record a 60-plus hit season once again. In fact, Klosowicz could find herself closer to the 70-75 mark if she reaches full potential.</p>\n                <p>Finally, I also see Klosowicz having another impressive season in recording extra-base hits. It\u2019ll take a lot for the utility player to break the single-season double record again, but it's not impossible. However, I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be the case. Instead, I could see Klosowicz ending with a double count of a clean 20, give or take.</p>\n                <p>Klosowicz\u2019s 13 home runs placed fourth in a single season in program history. I think Klosowicz will surpass this number in 2026. Cassidy Bell holds the record with her 20 home runs in the 2013 season. I don\u2019t see the junior reaching this mark, but there\u2019s definitely a way that Klosowicz can put herself at second, given she hits at least 16 long balls.</p>\n                <p>No matter how the numbers ultimately shake out, Klosowicz will be the centerpiece of Penn State\u2019s offense and one of the most dangerous bats in the Big Ten, and record books may once again be within reach.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>After a trip to the Midwest last week, Penn State welcomes a team from the Midwest in Indiana for a Friday night dual meet to continue the Big Ten season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will host the Hoosiers at 7 p.m. Friday in Rec Hall before the highly anticipated Bryce Jordan Center dual on Jan. 30 against Nebraska. The teams last met in Rec Hall where Penn State came out on top 46-0.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how this year\u2019s dual matches up.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 12 Jacob Moran (IU)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl jumped to No. 1 in the InterMat rankings while maintaining his undefeated record. He\u2019s controlled many matches this season, keeping up with his \u201clightning\u201d pace.</p>\n                <p>On the other side, Jacob Moran has just one loss on the season. He fell by major decision to Nic Bouzakis of Ohio State, who\u2019s currently the No. 2 wrestler in the country.</p>\n                <p>Despite a potential early feeling out process, Lilledahl\u2019s result could be similar to that of Bouzakis\u2019 win over one of the Hoosiers\u2019 top wrestlers.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. Logan Frazier (IU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze escaped his first major test against Iowa and will face an unranked opponent in Logan Frazier.</p>\n                <p>Frazier fell by tech fall to Ohio State\u2019s Ben Davino, who\u2019s ranked above Blaze at No. 2 at 133 pounds. With the Nittany Lion\u2019s blazing ability to score, a bonus-point victory is very much in the picture.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 25 Henry Porter (IU)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis dropped his first match of the season in his second dual match of the campaign. He\u2019s now the permanent starter at 141 pounds and has an opportunity to earn a ranked victory over Henry Porter.</p>\n                <p>Porter holds a 9-3 record, and has dropped all three matches to ranked wrestlers. His matchup with Davis will be one of his bigger tests after showing off his ability to stay on top of a wrestler.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. Joey Buttler (IU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness is the start of what could be the most dominant part of a lineup in wrestling history. He\u2019s the second No. 1 wrestler of six for the Nittany Lions and has ended matches early against unranked foes.</p>\n                <p>Buttler has a 9-7 record and will face his toughest opponent. The Hoosier will have to get off to a strong start, as Van Ness has been prone to give up an early takedown. Despite this, Van Ness often responds, still ending matches early despite going down early.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Bryce Lowery (IU)</p>\n                <p>Similar to Blaze, Duke also faced a major test in Carver-Hawkeye Arena and came out victorious. He\u2019ll take on an unranked Bryce Lowery for another likely easier battle.</p>\n                <p>Lowery is 7-5 and with Duke\u2019s speed, he could get back to a highly offensive matchup and score in bunches, leading to an early finish.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 19 Tyler Lillard (IU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink won\u2019t have wrestled in a dual in a week since the Iowa matchup when he takes the mat against Tyler Lillard. Mesenbrink won by forfeit on Sunday against Northwestern as the Wildcats didn\u2019t weigh in a 165-pound wrestler.</p>\n                <p>Lillard will be facing a machine in Mesenbrink, who, like Duke, scores a lot of points and very quickly. This season, Mesenbrink has added an emphasis to back points and attempting to go for falls, as he continues to prove he\u2019s far ahead of the rest of his competition.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 29 Derek Gilcher (IU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines also has pushed for back points, utilizing many different positions to get the nearfall swipes. He\u2019ll take on Derek Gilcher, who\u2019s 9-5 on the season.</p>\n                <p>Gilcher is in his first full season at 174 pounds after wrestling at both 165 and 174 last season. Against the top wrestler in the weight class, he could be in for a very quick night with Haines\u2019 constant aggression and overpowering ability in his second season at the weight.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 15 Sam Goin (IU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh is the new No. 1 wrestler at 184 pounds after defeating then-No. 1 Angelo Ferrari of Iowa in tiebreakers. After a much slower-paced match, he got back to his offense against Northwestern. Despite this, when he faces ranked opponents like Sam Goin, he has a tendency to be on the more defensive side.</p>\n                <p>Goin\u2019s chance to win will be solely on if he can finish on his attacks. Welsh has given up minimal points throughout the season, which has allowed him to be less offensive and still be successful.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 14 Gabe Sollars (IU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr has proven he\u2019s in a tier of his own at 197 pounds, and could be in for a big postseason after finishing as the national runner up a season ago.</p>\n                <p>Sollars sits at 8-5 with his losses piling up after the Big Ten schedule began. In the dominant conference, Barr has continued to shine while Sollars has started to fall, potentially a sign of how the Friday night matchup will go.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Caleb Marzolino (IU)</p>\n                <p>Mirasola is riding high after some major victories in his last few matches. He\u2019s back up to No. 12 in the rankings and will face yet another unranked wrestler.</p>\n                <p>When he takes on an unranked wrestler, he\u2019s much more offensive and can showcase his quickness and IQ, something he takes pride in.</p>\n                <p>Not only is Caleb Marzolino unranked, but he\u2019s also closer to the size of Mirasola, who\u2019s considered an undersized heavyweight for the class. That should play to the favor of Mirasola as the potential closing match of the dual.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s gymnastics is back home on Sunday, taking on its neighbors to the south, Maryland. The Nittany Lions are looking for a great meet in Rec Hall after a successful week 2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has started out their Big Ten schedule with a win after a showdown with Illinois. A 196.075-194.100 win got the Nittany Lions into the No. 4 spot on the Big Ten rankings and No. 17 in the NCAA rankings.</p>\n                <p>There is confidence with the Nittany Lions; now the question is whether they can continue to use it as they go through the rest of their season, facing Big Ten opponents, especially ones like Michigan.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins are also going into this meet very strong and having a lot of confidence. They are coming off four-straight wins, with three of those being in the Terrapin Quad. Maryland\u2019s most recent win was against Washington, beating them 194.265-193.575.</p>\n                <p>Vault has been a really strong apparatus for Maryland, with it having a very successful week 2 in the event. Three standout gymnasts that not only excelled on vault, but also really stepped out for the Terrapins were Katrina Mendez-Abolnik, Rayna Engelmayer and Taylor Rech.</p>\n                <p>Mendez-Abolnik put up a great performance and landed a 9.850, and Engelmayer and Rech both put up a score of 9.825.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white also have a history of being strong on vault, with most of its lineup excelling on the event. Against Illinois, Jessica Johanson scored a 9.825, and in its opening meet against Yale, multiple 9.800 and above scores, with standout performances by Ava Cash, who put up a 9.850, and Allison Kaempfer, who put up a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>The uneven bars might be an area where Penn State could excel, with Maryland looking at scores in the 9.700 range so far this season, and putting up an average of 9.750 last season for most of their gymnasts. The blue and white have a history of excelling in the uneven bars rotation, and bars were where a lot of points were racked up against Illinois last Friday. Ava Piedrahita scored a 9.925, and Dani Latronica scored a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>Beam will be a rotation that both teams have looked at improving on, and both teams have leaned on rotating their lineups, trying to find gymnasts who can really focus and excel on beam with an opportunity to get those scores up.</p>\n                <p>Maryland had an average of 9.6408 on beam in 2025, and that score is looking the same so far in the 2026 season. Penn State had an average of about 9.7480 in the 2025 season, and, similar to Maryland, are looking to be in that range so far in the 2026 season. Beam will be an event to watch with both the Terrapins and Nittany Lions being equally equipped.</p>\n                <p>Floor can be a crucial part of this meet, with a lot of great routines from both sides being brought out. The Terrapins\u2019 Madeline Komoroski had a great night on the floor against Washington last Saturday, scoring 9.875. Rech followed closely behind with another standout score of the night, 9.850. Penn State\u2019s Latronica also put down a great routine, with a score of 9.875, so seeing a Latronica-Komoroski matchup could be very interesting.</p>\n                <p>These teams have a lot of talent, a lot of it being equal in quality. They can put on a great show on Sunday and get a lot of important points going into the rest of the Big Ten season, and the 2026 season as a whole.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

They have the confidence to do well in this invitational and have the opportunity to really start off strong against their fellow conference teams.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white can also get a step up on Illinois, who it will not only cross paths with this weekend but also in the Big Ten opener on Feb. 1. The Fighting Illini have been falling short of a win so far this season, coming in third at the OSU Open against Ohio State, Michigan and Greenville University.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will also face off against two club teams: the Florida Storm and EVO Senior Men\u2019s Elite team. These two club teams consist of multiple gymnasts not competing for a university, but are competing at a collegiate level.</p>\n                <p>Illinois had a consistent 2025 season, with floor, highbar and parallel bars having consistent team scores across the whole season. Matthew Vu Nguyen is a really strong gymnast for the Fighting Illini, having high scores of 14.250 on vault, 14.050 on parallel bars and 13.400 on high bar. Garrett Schooley is another great candidate for all-around high scores, as he has a high of 14.300 on floor and 14.450 on vault.</p>\n                <p>Illinois needs to gain its confidence back this meet, but the Nittany Lions are looking at continuing their winning streak. The blue and white have had two standout gymnasts these past two weeks with one being Simpson, and the other Matthew Underhill. Both have put up high scores that pushed their team above its competitors.</p>\n                <p>Underhill\u2019s scores of 13.350 on floor, 13.750 on still rings and 14.300 on vault contributed to a large gap in the cumulative team results of the meet.</p>\n                <p>Both collegiate teams will be looking at each other this weekend as a way to set the tone for their future matchup. There is competition awaiting them both in the form of the club teams also participating, but both the Fighting Illini and the Nittany Lions will be focused on handling each other.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

Who I will become after all is said and done.</p>\n                <p>By bus, plane, train and car, I am leaving far beyond.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m leaving the country where I\u2019ve spent twenty years exploring corners unturned, tides unexplored, walking in the footsteps of Florentine philosophers, artists, poets and astronomers.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m becoming someone new without anyone there to see my departure or my arrival. Will the city of the Renaissance become a home for my own rebirth? Will I recognize ambition in its birthplace?</p>\n                <p>Florence, to me, feels both like a test and a teacher.

Will I walk where Machiavelli once did and learn what ambition truly demands? Will I look into the same night sky as Galileo and feel the courage it takes to question the universe as it\u2019s handed to us?</p>\n                <p>If I close my eyes, will I understand how Michelangelo painted creation itself, or how Leonardo da Vinci imagined a final supper before it was ever sacred? In my opera class, will I sing in the language of romance and longing, hoping to recreate something close to what Mozart once intended? Perhaps I will trace the strokes of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus\u201d and feel the reverence for beauty in every curve.</p>\n                <p>What if what waits on the other side of this door is a love I cannot take home with me, only clinging to the memories of a place I know my heart will belong to? What if I cry in a vineyard, learn what\u2019s hidden inside the grapes each glass of wine is made up of?</p>\n                <p>Soon, I will roam streets with soulmates I have yet to meet, embark on adventures I\u2019m only just beginning to book. My soul longs for the familiarity of a place I have never experienced in this body.</p>\n                <p>What awaits me in a city that does not yet know my name? Will I uncover the secrets of my own small universe, the way so many before me once did? What lessons await me in Piazzas that have seen centuries unfold?</p>\n                <p>As I revel in the heavens, look out on the balcony at terracotta roofs, I will picture the life I\u2019m leaving behind for a short while.

    "description": "<p>Women\u2019s lacrosse is almost back.</p>\n                <p>Penn State kicks off its season on the road at Richmond on Feb. 7 before playing a total of eight nonconference games to start the season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have faced the Spiders 12 times over the years, holding a near perfect record with 11 wins. Last year, Richmond edged out the blue and white with a 12-10 win.</p>\n                <p>The Spiders failed to make it to the NCAA tournament last year after falling in the second round of the Atlantic 10 tournament.</p>\n                <p>While they lost their two leading goal scorers in Colleen Quinn and Grace Muldoon to graduation,Richmond picked up Syracuse transfer Meghan Rode and Georgetown transfer Rileigh Meyer during the offseason, who\u2019ve made a combined 42 career starts.</p>\n                <p>Following the trip to Richmond, Penn State returns home to face UMass in its home opener on Feb. 11. The two teams haven\u2019t faced each other since 2013, but the blue and white holds a 9-0 all-time record.</p>\n                <p>After starting the season 2-3, the Minutemen won the next 13 straight, including the Atlantic 10 championship. UMass then fell to Princeton in the first round of the NCAA tournament, 19-10.</p>\n                <p>The Minutemen return redshirt senior Kassidy Morris for her final year. Last season, the Washago, Ontario, native finished tied for sixth in the country with 78 goals.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will then host Bucknell on Feb. 15 in what will likely be their easiest game of the year.</p>\n                <p>Penn State holds a 22-0 all-time record over the Bison, including a 16-4 win last year. Bucknell went 6-10 last year with a 1-6 record on the road.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s matchup with Pitt on Feb. 18 is a newer rivalry, having only played four times in program history. The Nittany Lions hold a 3-1 lead in the series.</p>\n                <p>Since only reaching NCAA status in 2021, the Panthers have seen increasing success from four wins in 2023 to eight last year \u2014 including a win over Penn State.</p>\n                <p>This year, Pitt lost its leading scorer from last year, Jenna Hendrickson, who scored 46 goals. However, it bolstered other parts of the squad, adding St. Bonaventure\u2019s goalkeeper Katelyn Hicks, who made the seventh-most saves in a single season in Bonnies\u2019 history.</p>\n                <p>After three straight home games, the blue and white travel to Philadelphia to face Drexel on Feb. 22.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started the series strong with eight straight wins, but has lost three of the last four matchups with a 9-3 all-time record.</p>\n                <p>After a 14-4 season, which culminated in the Dragons falling in the CAA championship game to Stony Brook, they then lost two of their top-three scorers, who combined for over half the team\u2019s points.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions remain on the road and travel north to Cornell for a matchup on Feb. 28. Penn State holds the all-time lead 15-4.</p>\n                <p>For the past several years, the Big Red have been on the cusp of tournament play, but didn\u2019t make either the conference or NCAA tournament last year with a 9-6 record.</p>\n                <p>While Cornell has seen steady play recently, Colgate had a much-improved year last season. The Raiders \u2014 who Penn State hosts on March 4 \u2014 went 9-8 last year after back-to-back years of less than five wins.</p>\n                <p>Colgate will have an opportunity to build on that success with the return of its three leading scorers from last year, including sophomore Aubrey McMahon, who could continue to grow with the Raiders over the next three years.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will play their last away nonconference game on March 8, travelling to the West Coast for a game against San Diego State in the teams\u2019 first-ever matchup.</p>\n                <p>The Aztecs are a struggling team who only posted three winning seasons in the past 10 years. Over the past two seasons, they\u2019ve tallied just seven wins.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wraps up its nonconference schedule by hosting Princeton on March 15. The Tigers are Penn State\u2019s only ranked nonconference opponent, entering the season at No. 6.</p>\n                <p>Princeton is also the only out of conference opponent this season that the Nittany Lions have a losing record with, sitting at 14-29 all time.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers enter 2026 fresh off a 16-4 season with a trip to the NCAA quarterfinals. They will be without last year\u2019s 89-goal scorer in McKenzie Blake, but have Jami MacDonald, who scored 58 goals last year, back for her senior year.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse will play seven out-of-conference games this season, with a few coming against highly-ranked opposition.</p>\n                <p>The non-conference slate will see the Nittany Lions play four games at Panzer Stadium, two on the road and one at a neutral site as part of The Crown Classic.</p>\n                <p>While most programs use the non-conference games as an opportunity to warm up in the cold winter months, Penn State may not get that opportunity. The Nittany Lions will play three ranked teams in the opening weeks, each of which is ranked in the top six of the Inside Lacrosse preseason poll.</p>\n                <p>Colgate</p>\n                <p>A date with Colgate will open the year at home for the blue and white, an opponent that has become a favorite for coach Jeff Tambroni to schedule as the Nittany Lions\u2019 first of the season.</p>\n                <p>This year will mark the third consecutive season where Penn State plays the Raiders to begin the year, with the blue and white going 1-1 in those matchups.</p>\n                <p>Colgate went 10-8 last season, and 4-4 in Patriot League play. The Raiders were led by sophomore Liam Connor with 90 points in 2025, but he\u2019s out of the picture after transferring to Georgetown. Their most productive returner will be senior Hunter Drouin, who recorded 32 goals and 16 assists for the Raiders last season.</p>\n                <p>Villanova</p>\n                <p>Next on the schedule for the Nittany Lions will be the Villanova Wildcats, who went 4-1 in Big East play and 8-7 overall before falling in the second round of last year\u2019s Big East tournament.</p>\n                <p>Villanova also lost its top scorer from last season, with attackman Matt Licata graduating at the end of the year. Colin Michener will be the Wildcats\u2019 most prolific returner, having scored 26 goals and recording 14 assists in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has won two straight games against the Wildcats and holds a 21-9 all-time record against them.</p>\n                <p>No. 2 Princeton</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will play their first high-level opponent on Valentine\u2019s Day when they take a trip to New Jersey to face No. 2 Princeton.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers went 13-4 overall and 5-1 in the Ivy League last season before falling to Syracuse in a 19-18 thriller in the quarterfinal round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>With Coulter Mackesy off to Boston as the Cannons\u2019 No. 4 overall pick in last season\u2019s PLL draft, star attackman Nate Kabiri will step into an even larger role this season for the Tigers. The junior tallied 61 points last season, second only to the departing Mackesy\u2019s mark of 63.</p>\n                <p>Navy</p>\n                <p>Penn State will stay on the road after the Princeton game, traveling to Annapolis for a meeting with Navy.</p>\n                <p>Navy went 8-7 in 2025, with a 4-4 mark in Patriot League play. Last year\u2019s meeting between the Nittany Lions and Midshipmen saw Penn State pull out a 13-7 victory at home in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Returning senior Mac Haley led all Navy players with 43 points, with Jack Ponzio and William Goers each returning after having seasons of 30 or more points.</p>\n                <p>Yale</p>\n                <p>The final day of February will see the Nittany Lions take on Yale at home.</p>\n                <p>Yale is the Nittany Lions\u2019 only non-conference opponent with a losing record last season, going 5-8 with a 3-3 mark in the Ivy League.</p>\n                <p>After a subpar season, things may only be getting harder for the Bulldogs as their top four scorers graduated after last season. Senior attackman David Anderson, who recorded 21 points for Yale last season, will be the most productive returner.</p>\n                <p>No. 4 Cornell</p>\n                <p>Tambroni will face his former team at his current home when No. 4 Cornell travels to face the Nittany Lions on March 7. While the Big Red are only No. 4 in the season-opening poll, they\u2019re coming off a nearly undefeated run to a national championship last season.</p>\n                <p>Cornell went 18-1 overall and an undefeated 6-0 in the Ivy League. Its last matchup with Penn State came on Memorial Day weekend, when the Big Red defeated the Nittany Lions 11-9 in the NCAA Semifinals.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps the biggest reason the Big Red are ranked No. 4 after an almost perfect season is the departure of CJ Kirst, who scored an NCAA record 247 goals at Cornell. 82 of those goals came last season on the way to a 115-point season for Kirst.</p>\n                <p>Junior attackman Ryan Goldstein will have a chance to match Kirst\u2019s 2025 numbers after an already impressive 93 points last season.</p>\n                <p>No. 6 North Carolina</p>\n                <p>Penn State will close its non-conference slate on March 14 with a neutral-site game against No. 6 North Carolina in Charlotte.</p>\n                <p>The Tar Heels went 10-5 in 2025 with a 3-1 record in ACC play. North Carolina made an appearance in the NCAA tournament despite a 14-7 loss to Duke in the ACC tournament, but it lost to Richmond in the first round.</p>\n                <p>Attackmen Owen Duffy and Dominic Pietramala will return to Chapel Hill this season, a duo that combined for 112 points last year.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Dueling column | Should Penn State fire men\u2019s basketball coach Mike Rhoades?",
    "author": "Will Horstman & Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>There\u2019s only been one season in Penn State\u2019s 130-year history when it failed to earn a conference win.</p>\n                <p>It happened in the 1935-36 Eastern Intercollegiate Conference season in which the Nittany Lions went 0-10. Yet nine decades later, Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad is on track to become the second conference winless team in program history.</p>\n                <p>With a 0-8 Big Ten record to start the 2025-26 season, Rhoades\u2019 seat seems to have warmed up in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Will Horstman: If Penn State wants to move on from Mike Rhoades, right now presents an opportunity</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall lacked energy as Wisconsin earned a 98-71 win over Penn State on Thursday night, dropping the Nittany Lions to 9-10 on the year and 0-8 in Big Ten play. Some fans online have voiced displeasure with Rhoades, who\u2019s in his third season leading the team.</p>\n                <p>If Penn State\u2019s administration also wants to move on from Rhoades, I believe an opportunity to do so is right now. This year\u2019s start has been subpar, and trends dating back to last season don\u2019t provide a positive outlook on Rhoades succeeding in the future with the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Penn State won nine Big Ten games during Rhoades\u2019 first season in Happy Valley with another conference win against Michigan in the Big Ten tournament. The Nittany Lions started the 2024-25 season 12-2, including an upset over No. 8 Purdue.</p>\n                <p>Since then, however, the Nittany Lions are 13-23 after Thursday\u2019s loss to the Badgers. To make matters worse, only four of those wins are against Big Ten teams, which all came in the latter portion of last season.</p>\n                <p>The other nine wins are all Quad 4 victories from this season\u2019s nonconference schedule as Penn State has yet to defeat a power-conference opponent this year. I\u2019m concerned for the Nittany Lions as I feel Rhoades\u2019 tendencies and style of play might have been figured out by the rest of the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>What\u2019s also concerning is that Penn State shows a lack of adjustments in games. The Nittany Lions had a 13-12 lead over Wisconsin right before a media timeout on Thursday, and the Badgers came out of it by generating a 50-22 advantage at halftime.</p>\n                <p>Multiple games this season have seen Penn State get in a similar situation and endure a blowout loss, like Indiana\u2019s 113-72 win on Dec. 9 or Maryland\u2019s 96-73 victory last Sunday.</p>\n                <p>To be fair, the Nittany Lions have kept some contests against top competition close, such as a 74-72 loss to then-No. 2 Michigan earlier this month. But 13 single-digit losses have piled up since Jan. 5, 2025, and recent results make it hard to feel those moral victories are making any progress toward building a program.</p>\n                <p>It feels like rock bottom for Penn State at this point in the season, and even though I didn\u2019t have many expectations for this year, the lack of effort on defense exhibited by players at times sort of showcases how the season has gone so far.</p>\n                <p>I have a great deal of respect for Rhoades \u2014 he\u2019s brought success to other teams he\u2019s coached, and it\u2019s possible he could end up guiding Penn State to become a better team than it has been. Rhoades and the Nittany Lions are a finalist for 2026 5-star guard Dylan Mingo, who would help Rhoades\u2019 efforts to turn Penn State around if he were to commit.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades also gave a good answer when asked about the future of Penn State.</p>\n                <p>\"Building a program is really, really hard. Building a program at a place that doesn't have much basketball tradition is even harder, but I signed up for it, man, and I believe in me,\" Rhoades said postgame Thursday night. \"I believe in how we do things. Some of you guys may not. I don't really care. I never cared before, but I'll figure it out. It might kill me, but I'll figure it out.\"</p>\n                <p>However, it\u2019s fair to be concerned about the current state of the Nittany Lions, which is increasingly making it tough to envision a bright future. It\u2019s early in Rhoades\u2019 tenure, but a reset on the program might not sound like the worst idea to Penn State\u2019s administration if it wants to look elsewhere for a coach.</p>\n                <p>Myles Hannak: He\u2019s on his last lifeline, but it\u2019s too early to pull the plug</p>\n                <p>Penn State men\u2019s basketball isn\u2019t good and historically hasn\u2019t been.</p>\n                <p>The program made the Final Four only once, in 1954, and there persists a feeling that the Nittany Lions aren\u2019t a \u201cbasketball school.\u201d Yes, that notion is correct, and recent history only reinforces that, yet the man in charge for most of those recent years, Rhoades, isn\u2019t to blame.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades is in the midst of his third season, and after a pair of season finishes around .500, this year seems like it may end up even worse. However, if you believe those results warrant change, let me attempt to sway things.</p>\n                <p>Since 2000, there have been five head coaches in Happy Valley: Jerry Dunn, Ed DeChellis, Pat Chambers, Micah Shrewsberry and Rhoades. Dunn went 35-54 in the new millennium, Chellis didn\u2019t post a winning season until his sixth year, while Chambers didn\u2019t do so until his fourth.</p>\n                <p>The lone boss to endure quick success, Shrewsberry, backstabbed Penn State after his second year to leave for Notre Dame, and left big shoes for Rhoades to fill as the next hire. In his second year in charge, Rhoades posted a winning season, and now, even as the record regressed, he brought in the program's best-ever recruiting class, offering optimism that, if given more time, results will prevail.</p>\n                <p>Those around the team need to level expectations \u2014 what exactly is the goal on the hardwood? It should be to provide little wins, boost optimism and change the program's narrative, all things that, in the historical scheme of things, have already been done during Rhoades\u2019 tenure.</p>\n                <p>Yes, Penn State now has more talent on its roster than in the past, both a negative and a positive for Rhoades, given he\u2019s able to attract it yet hasn\u2019t immediately translated it into results.</p>\n                <p>However, the grass isn\u2019t always greener, and ditching Rhoades would disrupt the process of what is being built in Happy Valley. Yes, it\u2019s bad now, but you don't get to sunshine without letting the clouds clear first, and Rhoades is the lone boss out there willing to throw himself into the eye of the storm.</p>\n                <p>Penn State isn\u2019t an attractive job; the administration will always prioritize the other athletic departments over basketball, it\u2019s just the culture, yet Rhoades is the only man to actually attempt to challenge that culture, not just work within the constraints.</p>\n                <p>Home fan attendance at Penn State has been a concern. While much of the belief in men\u2019s basketball comes from within the program, if those supporting the team showed the same resilience, fans would see that the team's future is more promising than any win total suggests, as it currently seems to be defined by nothing more than that.</p>\n                <p>If there were a basketball coach fired, Rhoades shouldn\u2019t be the frontrunner, as women\u2019s basketball coach Carolyn Kieger endured just as tumultuous results, and has been extended the grace of seven seasons with only one with a winning record \u2014 Rhoades deserves that same patience.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>In recent years, Penn State has made it a tradition to return to the venue where it all started, Rec Hall, with its brick exterior, decades worth of team photos and a plethora of banners won throughout its storied history.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions stepped onto the hardwood with a chance to tap into Rec Hall\u2019s rich history, as the blue and white haven\u2019t enjoyed the luxuries of being in the driver's seat this year.</p>\n                <p>Yet for nearly all 40 minutes of game action, the opposing Wisconsin Badgers held all the control and continued that disappointing trend this season, eventually drowning the Nittany Lions with an emphatic 98-71 win. With the defeat, Penn State fell to 9-10 and stood winless in conference play after eight games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI appreciate the administration and our physical plan for getting everything ready for us to play at Rec Hall and all that stuff, and it's a great game. We didn't live up to our end of it,\u201d Mike Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades\u2019 teams played in Rec Hall every year of his tenure, in an attempt to cultivate a greater basketball culture, yet every crushing defeat, especially in the same place where the program posted its best season ever in 1954 and earned its lone NCAA Final Four appearance, counteracts that effort. This year\u2019s loss marks consecutive blowouts at Rec Hall, with its only win coming off a 90-89 upset over Illinois in 2024.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have to have a level of urgency in the program to move forward, and I'll do that,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe've shown at times this year. We played good basketball, but not good enough basketball to win in the Big Ten.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions, despite what metric or angle taken, failed to display why they\u2019re better than the record suggests, and it\u2019s shaping up to be a heartbreaking season in the grand scheme of things. Penn State brought in the top Big Ten recruiting class this year, and its highest all-time recruit, yet the outlook for the future doesn\u2019t seem to change the narrative of the past.</p>\n                <p>Despite it being the third year of the \u201cReturn to the Rec\u201d and a White Out, during which students in attendance received free towels, it didn\u2019t seem to fill the stands, as the venue failed to reach 6,000 in capacity for the first time since Penn State added the occasion under Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI've coached a long time. I've been on both ends of this. This right now sucks,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI'll tell you this thing, my staff and I will give every piece of every fiber we have to try to right this ship \u2026 I'm not a quitter, and I hope our fans and our students support these kids, because they're good kids, and they're working really hard. But you're right, you've got to win.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While it appears those around the team may have seen their faith fractured, the Nittany Lions aren\u2019t phased, which reaffirms how Penn State has endured basketball success previously. Although the recent memories of Rec Hall are rather bitter for the blue and white, the venue symbolizes the unwavering excellence that the university\u2019s athletics embodies.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're on the same team, one team. We know our record isn't the best, we're just trying to move forward and reflect and just come back the next day better,\u201d freshman wing Mason Blackwood said. \u201cWe all committed to Penn State for a reason\u2026 There's no better way to go through it than together. The season\u2019s not over.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have 12 games left, and they\u2019ll search for any chance to finish with a note of optimism, not just for gratification, but to signal to the masses that they are trying and that history will not define or take away from that effort.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBuilding a program is really, really hard. Building a program at a place that doesn't have much basketball tradition is even harder, but I signed up for it,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201c I believe in how we do things. Some of you guys may not \u2013 I don't really care, I never cared before. But I'll figure it out.

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Penn State went to work in the first transfer portal window with Matt Campbell at the helm, bringing in 40 total players with 24 of them being from his former team in Iowa State.</p>\n                <p>Here are 10 new additions to keep an eye on.</p>\n                <p>Rocco Becht, quarterback</p>\n                <p>The first name on the list is an obvious one in quarterback Rocco Becht, who will be the starter next season.</p>\n                <p>He transfers to Penn State after four years at Iowa State, starting in three of them and winning 26 games. Becht threw for 9,274 yards and 64 touchdowns as well as 27 interceptions to go along with 499 yards and 19 scores on the ground.</p>\n                <p>Becht follows Campbell, offensive coordinator Taylor Mouser and quarterbacks coach Jake Waters from Ames, Iowa, to State College, giving him familiarity.</p>\n                <p>Time will tell if Becht will be a full-go or even available for spring practice, as he\u2019s coming off of a 2025 campaign where he had a partial labrum tear in his left shoulder, and an AC sprain in his right shoulder.</p>\n                <p>He recently posted on his Instagram during his visit to Penn State wearing a sling.</p>\n                <p>Marcus Neal Jr., safety</p>\n                <p>Becht is the most impactful addition on the offensive side of the ball, but for the defense it\u2019s safety Marcus Neal Jr.</p>\n                <p>Neal is coming off of a 2025 campaign where he started as a sophomore, notching 40 total tackles, three pass breakups and two interceptions. The year before, he appeared in all 13 games a freshman where he garnered 18 total tackles.</p>\n                <p>He was rated as a 4-star transfer per 247Sports, ranking as the No. 143 player overall and No. 9 safety. Neal is more than likely the favorite to replace Zakee Wheatley, who exhausted eligibility and declared for the NFL draft.</p>\n                <p>Caleb Bacon, linebacker</p>\n                <p>Penn State brought in a trio of key former Iowa State linebackers who were, but of the three, Caleb Bacon is the one to keep an eye on.</p>\n                <p>He finished his time with the Cyclones by appearing in 35 games, posting 131 total tackles, five pass breakups and two forced fumbles.</p>\n                <p>Bacon is a walk-on turned scholarship player as well as a former captain. He was rated a 4-star transfer, the No. 118 overall player and the No. 4 linebacker.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s a good chance Bacon starts alongside Rojas next year with Amare Campbell transferring to Tennessee and Dom DeLuca graduated.</p>\n                <p>Benjamin Brahmer, tight end</p>\n                <p>Benjamin Brahmer was the first player to transfer from Penn State, and he is a worthwhile addition.</p>\n                <p>The tight end is coming off of a 2025 campaign where he was the third-leading receiver for Iowa State, totaling 37 receptions for 446 yards and six touchdowns.</p>\n                <p>He was second-team All-Big 12 a year ago, and recorded 75 catches for 977 yards and nine scores during his time with the Cyclones. Brahmer rated as a 4-star transfer and ranked as the No. 41 overall player and No. 3 tight end.</p>\n                <p>Brahmer is the favorite to start alongside Andrew Rappleyea at tight end next year.</p>\n                <p>Brock Riker, center</p>\n                <p>Penn State lost four of five starters on the offensive line from 2025, but the program grabbed an intriguing transfer who is coming off of a strong 2025.</p>\n                <p>Brock Riker, a 6-foot-4, 285-pound center from Texas State, pledged to Penn State after a redshirt freshman season where he was a second-team All-America selection by The Athletic.</p>\n                <p>He was a hot topic once entering the portal, holding offers from Alabama, Oklahoma, Utah, Florida, South Carolina and Illinois.</p>\n                <p>Riker will likely compete with Dom Rulli, who started in the Pinstripe Bowl, for the center spot. Cooper Cousins is another name who could be in the mix, as he played center in high school, but through his first two years at Penn State he\u2019s seen his snaps at guard.</p>\n                <p>Siale Taupaki, defensive tackle</p>\n                <p>Along with other young talent, Penn State lost all three of its top defensive tackles as Zane Durant and Alonzo Ford Jr. are off to the NFL draft while Xavier Gilliam transferred to Tennessee.</p>\n                <p>Penn State addressed the position with a handful of players \u2014 One of those players is Siale Taupaki.</p>\n                <p>Taupaki, who comes from UCLA, is entering his eighth year of college football.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019ll reunite with defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn and defensive line coach Ikaika Malloe, who both coached him with the Bruins. During his time there, Taupaki appeared on defense in 33 games, garnering 38 total tackles, three tackles for loss and two sacks.</p>\n                <p>Brett Eskildsen, wide receiver</p>\n                <p>Penn State lost Trebor Pe\u00f1a, Devonte Ross and Kyron Hudson to the NFL, but in comes Brett Eskildsen.</p>\n                <p>A season ago he was the leading receiver in new receivers coach Noah Pauley's room, accumulating 30 catches for 526 yards and five touchdowns.</p>\n                <p>Alexander McPherson, defensive end</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions lost a talented young defensive end in Chaz Coleman, who transferred to Tennessee, and brought in Alexander McPherson.</p>\n                <p>The incoming sophomore played his high school ball at national powerhouse IMG Academy in Florida, and pledged to Colorado as a 3-star recruit.</p>\n                <p>McPherson appeared in 10 games between defense and special teams during his freshman campaign, missing two due to injury, and tallied 16 total tackles, six quarterback hurries and a blocked punt.</p>\n                <p>Jeremiah Cooper, defensive back</p>\n                <p>Jeremiah Cooper is an intriguing addition for the secondary, as he was an All-Big 12 selection in 2023.</p>\n                <p>Cooper started his career as a safety, but transitioned to cornerback for 2025, but only played in four games due to a season-ending knee injury.</p>\n                <p>In four seasons with Iowa State, he recorded 138 total tackles and eight interceptions.</p>\n                <p>Cristiano Rosa, kickoff specialist</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions replaced kickoff specialist Gabe Nwosu with a player from a 2025 College Football Playoff team in Cristiano Rosa. He notched 52 touchbacks in two years in the role for James Madison.</p>\n                <p>He also seems to have ties to Penn State, as he posted a photo on his Instagram of him as a kid wearing a jersey.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

It\u2019s not just the fact that they were both designed by the same architect.</p>\n                <p>Designed by Charles Z. Klauder, Rec Hall was completed in 1928. Just a year prior, Klauder\u2019s other design, The Palestra, opened in Philadelphia.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s not where the similarities between the two arenas end, though, as Penn State has now lost in both historic venues this season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions welcomed 13-5 Wisconsin but had its Rec Hall reunion ruined, falling to the Badgers 98-71 to remain winless in conference play and fall into a now six-game losing streak</p>\n                <p>\u201cBuilding a program is really, really hard,\u201d Mike Rhoades said. \u201cBuilding a program at a place that doesn\u2019t have much basketball tradition is even harder, but I signed up for it, man, and I believe in me.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin won the opening tipoff, but Kayden Mingo opened the scoring for the evening after a little bit of back-and-forth.</p>\n                <p>Mingo called his own name again, hitting a step-back jumper to put the blue and white up 4-0 in the early running.</p>\n                <p>Penn State let the Badgers work it to a 9-8 Wisconsin lead quickly after some soft defense and a three-pointer given up for a one-point deficit that lingered for a while.</p>\n                <p>Thanks to an Ivan Juri\u0107 board that led to a Freddie Dilione V and Melih Tunca connection, the Nittany Lions moved back in front and seized the momentum, even picking up a foul.</p>\n                <p>A near four-point play became three-straight charity stripe makes for Braeden Carrington, which once again gave the Badgers a comfortable lead at 23-13, forcing Rhoades and the blue and white into a timeout.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions fell into an 18-point hole after a tough possession from Juri\u0107 and Mingo ended without a score, which made Penn State take another one of its timeouts.</p>\n                <p>It only got worse from then on out for the blue and white, as a three-pointer from Andrew Rohde and another one from Carrington contributed to a 21-1 Wisconsin scoring run that made it a 42-17 Badger lead with just under three minutes left in the first half.</p>\n                <p>The student section voiced its dismay with boos, \u201csell the team\u201d chants and other jeers as Penn State went to the locker room at halftime, facing a 50-22 deficit. Josh Reed and Wisconsin\u2019s Austin Rapp exchanged words and got a little chippy after the buzzer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have nothing to lose,\u201d Reed said. \u201c(We\u2019re) just going out there and trying to play as hard as we can every single game and see where it takes us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A Wisconsin travel call was the only thing that went the blue and white\u2019s way in the early running of the second half as the Nittany Lions went nearly three minutes without a score.</p>\n                <p>Mason Blackwood knocked one down to cut it to a 60-30 deficit, but any chance Penn State had of making it competitive was well behind it. There was no shortage of scoring for the Badgers, though, with everyone getting in on the action as three exceeded the double-digit mark.</p>\n                <p>With just 11 minutes remaining in a game that was already a blowout, a three-pointer from Reed followed by Dilione and Mingo scores at least kept the student section alive.</p>\n                <p>Some physical defense from Mingo, still donning the face shield, wasn\u2019t enough to stop the Badgers from making it a 31-point game on an extended possession that ended in a Nolan Winter basket.</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin was shooting 40% from three-point range when a Zach Kinziger three-ball gave his squad a drowning 84-47 advantage. The Badgers ended the night 15-35 from that range for 43% compared to the Nittany Lions\u2019 8-27, with Reed shooting 100% from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe best way to keep a team from hitting a lot of threes is limiting the number of attempts,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cMy teams have done that, and we\u2019re not doing, and we\u2019re getting really behind.

The threat alleged there was a bomb in the Forum Building and the person who posted it threatened to \u201cshoot this place up.\u201d This attack was allegedly going to occur at 10 a.m. on Dec. 16.</p>\n                <p>The Penn State University Police and Public Safety, Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Ferguson Township Police, State College Police and UPPS bomb squad responded to the threat and obtained records via YikYak, eventually identifying Steczkowski as the threat\u2019s alleged poster, according to the affidavit.</p>\n                <p>Officers ensured the \u201cimmediate safety of building occupants\u201d and reported finding no suspicious items in the Forum Building, according to the affidavit.</p>\n                <p>Steczkowski was located that morning and interviewed by police. According to the complaint, she shared that she and her roommate, Kahn, were complaining about finals and discussed sending a threat.</p>\n                <p>Allegedly, Steczkowski would be paid $10 by Kahn to post the threat on YikYak, which was intended to disrupt an exam Kahn was scheduled to take at noon. \\</p>\n                <p>In her interview, Steczkowski acknowledged the mass shooting that had occurred earlier in the week at Brown University and that \u201cthe posting could cause panic/alarm,\u201d according to the affidavit, but she \u201cdidn't think the messages would be taken seriously\u201d or \u201cexpect the posts to be tracked back to her.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The affidavit described Steczkowski as \u201cemotional and apologetic\u201d and that she was aware that her actions were against the law.</p>\n                <p>Police later interviewed Kahn, who allegedly advised Steczkowski that the threat was \u201ca bad idea and that someone would take it seriously,\u201d according to the affidavit.</p>\n                <p>Neither Steczkowski or Kahn own firearms or had conducted research related to the creation of weapons of mass destruction, according to the affidavit.</p>\n                <p>UPPS determined there was no threat and all exams were taken as scheduled, according to a Penn State spokesperson.

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>PJ Duke has wrestled all across the world, most of the time without a hostile environment against him.</p>\n                <p>However, that changed when he stepped foot on the mat in Carver-Hawkeye Arena for what was considered a highly anticipated dual against No. 4 Iowa on Friday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a pretty crazy environment,\u201d Duke said. \u201cIt's like something you dream about your whole life. Iowa has a good reputation for fans and put on a good show, so it was pretty cool to be a part of.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In the 157-pound matchup, Duke went to battle against No. 12 Jordan Williams in front of the raucous environment. It was his first real test, similar to fellow freshman and 133-pounder Marcus Blaze.</p>\n                <p>Blaze faced national finalist Drake Ayala. Similar to Duke, Blaze won his matchup 4-2, needing just one takedown to get the job done.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe both have pretty similar mindsets,\u201d Duke said. \u201cSo, no matter where it is, whether it's in practice or an actual match or wherever, just try to be the same person as always.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Duke faced a wrestler who was on the defensive side more than the offensive. For a wrestler like the Nittany Lion who enjoys putting up a lot of points, it was a much different match than what he\u2019s used to.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, he remained centered and relaxed, and pounced on the opportunity when it arose, giving him the only takedown of the match.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI would say I was kind of chasing him a little but he was more defensive, and I would say most of the Iowa teams got more defensive the whole time, and just had to be patient,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI knew an opening would eventually come and once it did, I took advantage of it, took him down and that was pretty much the match.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The true freshmen have taken the wrestling world by storm this season. Not just Duke and Blaze, but the entire class, including Oklahoma State\u2019s trio of Ladarion Lockett, Sergio Vega and Landon Robideau. Duke and Blaze are in a very strong position to eventually be at the top of the rankings in their respective weight class.</p>\n                <p>Even with being the top-two ranked wrestlers in the Class of 2025, the success Duke has had wasn\u2019t anticipated. Most freshmen don\u2019t have the capabilities to start 11-0, like Duke is currently. Additionally, most freshmen go the early redshirt route, and in Duke\u2019s case, the redshirt would\u2019ve been an easy path with preseason national title favorite Tyler Kasak at the same weight class.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, Duke is the 157-pound wrestler for his freshman season and could very well win the national title.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI would definitely be pretty surprised,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to be where I am now, and I put in a lot of work in the past. I think I hold myself to a pretty high standard, so I\u2019ll definitely be proud of myself.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Duke already into the top three in his weight class, Penn State\u2019s team could very well exceed the point total of last year\u2019s record-setting team at the NCAA Championships. The way things are run at Penn State is unlike anywhere else, as the team continues to raise the ceiling year in and year out.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI would say a lot of teams aren\u2019t like that,\u201d Duke said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s successful and everyone wants each other to get better. Most of the time when people are successful, they break it down. But not here, it\u2019s way different. Everyone wants you to get better, to do better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "The Daily Collegian\u2019s editorial opinion is determined by its Board of Editors, with the editor-in-chief holding final responsibility for content.",
    "description": "<p>From AI-enabled medical devices to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence has transformed the way we work and live. Yet many universities and professors are responding to this shift with avoidance instead of education, leaving students unprepared to enter an AI-driven workforce and navigate the technology\u2019s ethical complexities.</p>\n                <p>This approach is ignoring what\u2019s already happening on college campuses. According to <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford University\u2019s 2025 AI Index Report</a>, 86% of students utilize AI for school work, while 61% of faculty incorporate it into their teaching.</p>\n                <p>As AI becomes increasingly accessible, universities have a responsibility to equip students with the skills demanded by a changing workforce and to educate them about algorithmic bias, environmental harm, plagiarism and accuracy concerns.</p>\n                <p>Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, CoPilot and Gemini have gained popularity in recent years, but artificial intelligence itself is not new. For decades, other forms of AI have been used for data analysis, pattern recognition and automation.</p>\n                <p>What distinguishes generative AI is its ability to create text, images and code using existing data. Its capacity to produce original-seeming work has driven concern surrounding academic integrity and sparked conversations over what constitutes appropriate versus unethical use in both classrooms and everyday life.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, only 39% of academic institutions had an AI-related acceptable use policy as of early 2025, according to Stanford\u2019s report. While Penn State doesn\u2019t have a university-wide AI policy, it implements course-specific policy and provides general guidelines for both students and professors.</p>\n                <p>Last year, Penn State launched an artificial intelligence engineering major and minor, making it stand out among universities preparing future engineers to build and refine these systems.</p>\n                <p>However, AI\u2019s influence extends far beyond engineering. This technology is rapidly entering fields across the liberal arts, business, journalism, healthcare and many other disciplines.</p>\n                <p>Whether we like it or not, this integration is largely beyond our control, as employers across industries are already using AI tools to cut costs, increase efficiency and remain competitive.</p>\n                <p>What is within our control is how we\u2019re navigating it.</p>\n                <p>Universities should not encourage students to have AI complete their work for them. Instead, institutions and professors must teach students what AI is already being used for in their respective industries, and when it shouldn\u2019t be used and why.</p>\n                <p>While universities are still deciding how to approach AI in the classrooms, it\u2019s evident that education on the matter is essential in preparing graduates who will work alongside AI in their careers. Acting as though AI doesn\u2019t exist or banning its use outright is disservicing students.</p>\n                <p>Fear-based conversations don\u2019t prepare students for life after graduation; thoughtful, honest discussions about the realities and future of AI do.</p>\n                <p>Understanding both the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology not only prepares students for the inevitable but provides them with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their AI use.</p>\n                <p>As AI use expands, it is imperative that conversations about misuse, along with environmental and societal impacts, expand as well.</p>\n                <p>According to <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2024/07/the-uneven-distribution-of-ais-environmental-impacts\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review</a>, the training process for one AI model releases carbon emissions equivalent to those of hundreds of homes nationwide and has caused severe stress on our freshwater resources. These impacts disproportionately burden vulnerable communities.</p>\n                <p>The rise of generative AI has also intensified ethical concerns around plagiarism, originality and accuracy. Because these tools generate content based on existing material, students must be taught how to use them in appropriate contexts and how to properly evaluate and verify AI-produced information.</p>\n                <p>AI systems are also prone to factual errors and bias, making human oversight imperative. Without instruction on when AI use crosses ethical boundaries and when it can be used responsibly as a tool, students are left to navigate these risks on their own.</p>\n                <p>Furthermore, AI bias stems from both explicit and implicit human biases embedded in various stages of its pipeline, from data collection and labeling to model training and deployment, according to <a href=\"https://www.chapman.edu/ai/bias-in-ai.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Chapman University</a>. The system has already produced unfair and discriminatory bias in reporting, sourcing and continues to reinforce existing biases.</p>\n                <p>As AI continues to evolve and become used on a wider scale, it\u2019s of the utmost importance that higher education institutions educate their students on how AI is utilized and how to engage with the technology responsibly.</p>\n                <p>A comprehensive AI education should force people to rethink the way they engage with artificial intelligence.</p>\n                <p>The Daily Collegian Opinions Editor Teresa Phelan can be reached at tpp5354@psu.edu.</p>\n                <p>MORE EDITORIALS</p>",

The days that were a struggle, or spike in fevers, she wasn't feeling well, we stayed by her side.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Soon after the initial diagnosis, Bryan said they were introduced to THON and the Four Diamonds, and a \u201cweight was lifted off their shoulders.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the back of your mind, you're thinking in your head, \u2018Well, one, let's get her feeling better,\u2019\u201d Bryan said. \u201cBut two, how the heck are we going to pay for this? And how are we going to afford this down the road? And we'll figure it out, but it's going to be a long journey.\u201d</p>\n                <p>THON is the world's largest student-run philanthropy that aims to provide emotional and financial support to Four Diamonds families who have been impacted by childhood cancer.</p>\n                <p>In their third year as a THON family, the Faulders finally made it to THON Weekend after watching on TV years prior. Keaghan was \u201cover the moon\u201d to attend live, and can\u2019t wait for THON 2026.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen we felt isolated as a childhood cancer family at the beginning, and we weren't sure who to connect with,\u201d Kaitland said. \u201cTHON really pulled us in. They kind of wrapped us up in their energy, and you don't really understand the energy until you go to THON.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Faulders family is paired with the Penn State figure skating team through the THON \u201cAdopt-a-Family\u201d program. Kaitland said they have supported her family through all of their highs and lows.</p>\n                <p>Ice skating team member and THON Chair Emma Wassel said Keaghan and her family will always be an inspiration for the group, and is the strongest girl they know.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a teammate this year, Lillie Nye, and she has gotten very involved in THON and with the Faulders the last couple of years,\u201d Wassel, a fifth-year studying integrated arts, said. \u201cShe's actually skating a tribute program to those we have lost. She will be competing with that program, which is a really cool thing for us to see.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Throughout treatment, Keaghan demonstrated impressive strength in her ability to bounce back after tougher days, according to her father.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat little spark there that she has just does not let cancer steal her joy,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cIt's just pure key. And wanting to help out where she could, when she could and giving back to the hospital. These kids are resilient \u2026 if the kids were feeling okay, they had a smile on their face, not a care in the world, and just powerin\u2019 through.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In addition to treatment in the hospital, Keaghan spent her time running her own nail salon, playing Uno with nurses and even donated her hair to create a wig for another child fighting cancer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHer ability to connect with adults and nurses and volunteers and teachers that came into the hospital just like they're just normal people and even other kids that were battling cancer,\u201d Kaitland said. \u201cIt was quite amazing to see both her strength and her personality continue to show through no matter how she felt.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Keaghan\u2019s resilience was rewarded with remission in 2023 and a long-awaited bell ringing in May 2025 to symbolize the end of her cancer treatment.</p>\n                <p>Keaghan\u2019s father said it was one of the \u201cproudest days of his life\u201d and her mother said it symbolized survival and a thankfulness to ring the bell and celebrate its meaning after passing by it thousands of times throughout their treatment journey.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFor Keaghan and even for us, it was really more to end the fight that she never asked to face, it is just the strength that we saw behind her,\u201d Kaitland said. \u201cFor us, it just symbolized that we survived. We're so happy we got here. We're so proud.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Wassel said she was lucky enough to be personally invited by Keaghan to support her in ringing the bell at the Penn State Health Children\u2019s Hospital. Additionally, she said the team looks forward to welcoming her onto the ice rink for her first time skating.</p>\n                <p>\u201cKeaghan's story is just so inspiring for us as a team,\u201d Wassel said. \u201cA lot of us kind of grew up in a solo sport, one where we didn't really have teamwork and like that kind of level of camaraderie, and so the Faulders have such a strong team of friends and family that were and are still backing them throughout Keaghan\u2019s battle, and they show us that there\u2019s strength in leaning on those who love you.</p>\n                <p>Kaitland said \"stories like Keaghan's gives people hope.\u201d Hope to those standing THON Weekend, and hope to families facing similar challenges.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTHON is so powerful because it is very personal for the families of the cancer children, but I hope when they hear stories about a real child like Keaghan, we are a real family, and we've lived the long nights,\u201d Kaitland said. \u201cWe\u2019ve felt their fear, we\u2019ve praised the victories.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE THON CONTENT</p>",

Dan Connor, who was the linebackers coach in 2025, is set to remain on staff and will do more day-to-day coaching with that position group.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what to know about the Nittany Lions\u2019 new linebackers coach.</p>\n                <p>Coaching history</p>\n                <p>Veidt has spent the last two seasons as the Bearcats\u2019 defensive coordinator, but the initial report of his hiring to Penn State said the two parties mutually agreed to part ways. Cincinnati allowed 25.6 points per game under Veidt in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Prior to his short stint at Cincinnati, Veidt worked under Campbell for eight seasons as Iowa State\u2019s associate head coach and linebackers coach. He was named the Football Scoop National Linebacker Coach of the Year in 2017 and earned a Broyles Award nomination the year after.</p>\n                <p>Veidt had all three of his starting linebackers earn All-Big 12 honors in three straight seasons from 2017-19 and helped coach 45 all-conference defenders during his time with the Cyclones.</p>\n                <p>Campbell originally found Veidt at Toledo, where the linebackers coach spent the 2014-15 seasons. Veidt also served as the recruiting coordinator for the Rockets.</p>\n                <p>Veidt was the head coach at Bluffton University, a Division III school in Ohio, from 2008-13. He helped his squad break 40 records at a school that had won just one game the year before Veidt\u2019s arrival.</p>\n                <p>His coaching career began at Muskingum University, where he played collegiate football from 1992-95. Veidt joined as a graduate assistant in 1997 before moving laterally to Indiana in 1999.</p>\n                <p>A year later, Veidt returned to his alma mater to be the defensive coordinator, a role he held from 2000-03. In 2004, he joined West Virginia as a graduate assistant but returned to calling plays in 2006 for Saint Vincent in Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Prominent players coached</p>\n                <p>Veidt coached plenty of successful linebackers at Iowa State, including Willie Harvey and Jake Hummel.</p>\n                <p>Harvey earned three straight All-Big 12 honorable mentions from 2016-18 and finished his career with 289 tackles, 31 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks.

    "title": "3 key games to watch in No. 7 Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse\u2019s 2026 regular season",
    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 7 Penn State, after blazing a path to the NCAA National Semifinal game at Gillette Stadium, generally faces a difficult schedule year-after-year. Being a member of the ever-competitive Big Ten, as well as consistently scheduling quality non-conference opponents, there are a plethora of important games to gauge the long-term success of the coming 2026 season.</p>\n                <p>Here are my picks for the three most important games of the Nittany Lions\u2019 upcoming regular season.</p>\n                <p>Penn State vs. Colgate | Feb. 1</p>\n                <p>In the all-important season opener, Penn State will host Colgate at Panzer Stadium to kick off the fresh calendar with a rematch of 2025\u2019s NCAA Tournament first-round matchup.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions faced the Raiders twice last season, winning both games despite the two being spread out throughout the year. On Feb. 1, 2025, Penn State opened its season with a 14-9 victory over Colgate at home. Then, on May 10, the blue and white defeated the Raiders 13-11, advancing to the National Quarterfinal.</p>\n                <p>Colgate returned its fourth-highest goal-scorer in Hunter Drouin, who tallied 32 goals and 16 assists last season. However, the Raiders\u2019 top-three producers have since graduated or hit the transfer portal, making their offensive core appear vastly different.</p>\n                <p>Penn State vs. No. 4 Cornell | March. 7</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have a chance at taking their revenge on the team that eliminated them in the National Semifinals: No. 4 Cornell per Inside Lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>Despite falling in the tournament, the blue and white were the only team in 2025 to beat Cornell. And it was a thriller, to say the least. On March. 8, Penn State clawed back from a four-goal deficit with under three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. In overtime, senior Ethan Long dealt the final blow and secured a road victory over the eventual national champions.</p>\n                <p>But nothing else mattered in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on May. 24. With a national championship berth on the line, the Nittany Lions fought to a 5-4 lead going into the second half. However, a six-goal third quarter from the Big Red widened the gap too far for the blue and white\u2019s comeback attempt. Penn State lost 11-9.</p>\n                <p>And that was with Penn State silencing Cornell\u2019s most elite attackman, Tewaaraton Award winner CJ Kirst. However, many of the Big Red\u2019s top-performers graduated as well, including Kirst, presenting a new look for the defending national champions.</p>\n                <p>But if there\u2019s anything that the collegiate lacrosse world knows about Cornell, it\u2019s that coach Connor Buczek\u2019s teams are tough to beat, no matter who\u2019s on the field.</p>\n                <p>Penn State vs. No. 1 Maryland | March. 21</p>\n                <p>The Big Ten is a gauntlet of a conference and although the Terrapins didn\u2019t win the Big Ten championship, Maryland went all the way to the National Championship game before being taken down by Cornell, 13-10.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will open Big Ten play at Panzer Stadium against Maryland at 3 p.m on March. 21.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions met the Terrapins twice in 2025, first in the regular season, where the then-second ranked team in the nation defeated the blue and white 13-8 in College Park, Maryland. Then, in the Big Ten semifinals, Maryland defeated Penn State 10-8 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>\n                <p>After going 14-4 overall last season, the Terrapins were ranked No. 1 in Inside Lacrosse\u2019s Preseason Media Poll. On offense, Maryland retained star-attackman Eric Spanos as well as rising senior Braden Erksa.</p>\n                <p>Spanos was the Terrapins\u2019 leading scorer last year, netting 36 goals while adding 19 helpers for a team-high 55 points. Meanwhile, Erksa wasn\u2019t far behind with 33 goals and 15 assists.</p>\n                <p>With the national runner-ups maintaining much of their attacking power, Maryland is set to make another deep run in both the Big Ten and national tournaments. The game against Maryland presents one of Penn State\u2019s biggest tests of the season.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Preview | No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey returns home for series against Delaware",
    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State earned its first sweep of the new year as the Nittany Lions left New York with two wins over Syracuse. The series featured four different goal scorers for Penn State over the course of seven goals. Syracuse gave the Nittany Lions a scare to conclude the series; however, it could pose as a step in the right direction. After a brief stint of unsuccessful games, the blue and white followed the series with a win over No. 12 Cornell.</p>\n                <p>Penn State now shifts its focus to its first home series of 2026 against another conference opponent in Delaware. The teams previously met on Oct. 10 and Oct. 11. The Nittany Lions swept the Blue Hens with two shutouts at Fred Rust Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Senior weekend</p>\n                <p>Several seniors and graduate students receive honors throughout the upcoming series against the Blue Hens. Tessa Janecke, Mya Vaslet, Katelyn Roberts, Katie DeSa, Kendall Butze, Maddy Christian, Leah Stecker and Taylor Lum will all be a part of a memorable moment that will be etched in their lives.</p>\n                <p>All players successfully did their part throughout the season. From breaking records to being a reliable goal scorer with the puck on their stick. These athletes made their presence known in their final year of collegiate hockey. With a few weeks left in the season and postseason on the rise, expect to hear these names more before the season is all said and done.</p>\n                <p>Blocked shots bonanza</p>\n                <p>An interesting stat jumps out when looking at the Delaware team. The Blue Hens led the conference in blocked shots as a team with 616, averaging just under 24 per game. That number sits 200 more than the second-place team.</p>\n                <p>The defensive unit excelled at defending their net, clogging shooting lanes and putting their body on the line. Penn State suffered a few blocked shots over the season, some of which were taken the other way. This area of their game will need to be adjusted to avoid costly turnovers.</p>\n                <p>To do so, the Nittany Lions need to elevate the puck and create routine, quick passes to open up shooting lanes.</p>\n                <p>Possible advantage?</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions played three games in five days over the weekend and into the week. However, Delaware hasn\u2019t played since Jan. 17. This could result in slower line changes and breakouts than a slightly more rested Blue Hens team.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, travel could play a role, as Penn State\u2019s game against the Big Red was held in New York as well. Ultimately, the Nittany Lions have less time than normal to practice and study for their upcoming series.</p>\n                <p>Enter DeSa, Exit Janecke and Nicole Hall</p>\n                <p>Katie DeSa returned to the lineup against Cornell after missing the previous four games with an apparent injury suffered in the series against Ohio State. Picking up where she left off, the senior looked stellar in net as she made 24 saves on 25 shots, only allowing one goal early in the second period.</p>\n                <p>However, on the forwards front, this series will be the last before both Janecke and Hall depart for Milan, Italy, to participate in the Winter Olympics. The Nittany Lions have been playing without their freshman goal-scorer, Matilde Fantin, for the previous few games. With the addition of two other goal-scorers leaving, the forward depth of Penn State will be challenged in the series to come.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "George Keene | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s volleyball is off to a fast start, winning its first four matches of the season and dropping only two sets total.</p>\n                <p>However, the Nittany Lions head to Illinois to take on No. 15 McKendree for their first road trip of the season at 7 p.m. Friday and 5 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>McKendree had an uphill climb to start the season, causing it to get off to a slow start, dropping matches against No. 1 UCLA and No. 3 Long Beach State. The Bearcats suffered a sweep in both matches.</p>\n                <p>McKendree bounced back at the UC Invitational, claiming a 3-1 victory over the University of Charleston and a 3-0 victory against Mount Olive.</p>\n                <p>This week\u2019s battle against Penn State will be McKendree\u2019s first home matches of the season, where it was dominant last year, winning 13 of 15 on their home floor. On the opposite side of the net, Penn State was .500 away from Happy Valley last season.</p>\n                <p>Heading into the matchup, both teams have been led by their stars early this season.</p>\n                <p>Sean Harvey seized the reins so far, collecting 48 kills and only 11 errors through four matches. Gaige Gabriel and Matthew Luoma have also performed well thus far, each with 28 kills. If the blue and white frontline can hit efficiently and keep the pressure on the Bearcats\u2019 backline, they give themselves a good shot.</p>\n                <p>For the Bearcats, they\u2019re being led by a trio of their own. Tyler Tripp and Bryce Wetjen each have 41 kills, and Sam Hoskin trails them with 36 so far this season. As a squad, the Bearcats struggled on the serve, only creating 17 aces and 60 errors.</p>\n                <p>Similarly, Penn State hasn\u2019t been dominant in serving the ball, ranking 22nd in the NCAA with 1.50 aces per set. McKendree is a few spots below, at 1.31 aces per set.</p>\n                <p>Dominating play at the net will be integral in coming away with victories this weekend, as both teams created success by attacking this season.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is hitting .319 compared to McKendree\u2019s .294; both rank in the top 21 in the NCAA. Penn State and McKendree faced off only one time in 2019, with Penn State grabbing the home victory.</p>\n                <p>Both teams are hot and come into the double header on win streaks, but one\u2019s momentum is coming to an end this weekend.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Position preview | Penn State softball returns multitude of veteran infielders",
    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>With the 2026 season just around the corner, Penn State has a chance to bounce back after a rocky 2025 campaign. The Nittany Lions came up short of reaching the NCAA Tournament after reaching it in 2024, following their loss to Nebraska in the Big Ten quarterfinals and finished the year with a 25-27 record.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white raked in the batter\u2019s box last season and set multiple new single-season program records in batting average, home runs, RBIs, runs scored and total bases. Many of the squad\u2019s heavy bats come from the infield.</p>\n                <p>Clarisa Crowell\u2019s infield is spearheaded by a few returning players and a lot of fresh faces.</p>\n                <p>Juniors Kaylie Walters and Michela Barbanente will offer veteran leadership inside the diamond. Walters was an offensive anchor for the blue and white last season as the primary shortstop. The Philadelphia native started all 52 games and had a .350 average with 42 hits in 120 at-bats.</p>\n                <p>However, Walters must clean up her defense as she committed the most errors on the squad with 10 in the 2025 campaign.</p>\n                <p>Barbanente was the Nittany Lions\u2019 primary second baseman last season and she produced a solid offensive campaign. The Itasca, Illinois, native started 49 of her 51 appearances and slashed .284, with 33 hits, eight home runs and 36 RBIs in 116 at bats.</p>\n                <p>Penn State also bolstered its infield depth and brought in graduate transfer Cara Bohner. The Towson transfer is a dependable bat, holding an impressive .292 career average with 128 hits. The Danville, Pennsylvania, native can also flash the glove, with a career fielding average of .947.</p>\n                <p>The lefty batter primarily played the middle infield positions defensively over her three seasons with Towson, but she can also be stretched across the infield and outfield.</p>\n                <p>After catcher Audree Mendoza transferred, the blue and white now have a battle for the starting position behind the plate between Kirsten Finarelli, Madison Seidel and Macy Chamberlin.</p>\n                <p>Finarelli was the lone 2025 recruit for her position in Happy Valley. The Lehman, Pennsylvania, native was a nationally ranked catcher prospect as the No. 41 ranked player in her signing class and No. 21 among catchers. As a three-sport athlete in high school, Finarelli is versatile and can also play across the infield.</p>\n                <p>The freshman was named the Pennsylvania 3A Player of the Year for her 2024 campaign and earned a Wyoming Valley Conference All-Conference selection in every season of her high school career.</p>\n                <p>While Finarelli will be a key piece of Penn State throughout her career, the starting position battle is mostly between Chamberlin and Seidel.</p>\n                <p>After missing the second half of last season due to injury, sophomore Chamberlin is set for her return to action. The Wauseon, Ohio, native started 20 of her 26 appearances in the 2025 season, slashing .321 with 17 hits in 53 at bats. She committed zero errors, but caught just two base runners last season.</p>\n                <p>However, the starting nod will most likely go to the veteran Seidel. The senior started 33 of her 43 appearances last season for Penn State, after not seeing much of the field during her freshman and sophomore campaigns.</p>\n                <p>The Hilltown, Pennsylvania, native slashed a .247 average with 23 hits and 15 RBIs in 93 at bats in 2025. While Seidel has committed zero errors throughout her career, she also caught just two runners while allowing 32 stolen bases last season.</p>\n                <p>The highest-ranked recruit in the 2025 class for the Nittany Lions was Allison Oneacre. The Alpharetta, Georgia, native was the No.19 ranked national recruit, via Extra Inning Softball and the fifth-ranked infielder in the class.</p>\n                <p>During her career at Milton High School, Oneacre was a four-time First Team All-Region choice from 2021 to 2024, along with All-State honors in 2023 and 2024. Oneacre is expected to be a big bat in Crowell\u2019s lineup as she batted .598 with 101 hits and 84 RBIs over 55 games played at Milton High School.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Kalli Karwowski will also be a new infielder bat for the blue and white. The Peckville, Pennsylvania, native has championship experience as she led Valley View High School to the 2024 District 4A Title and 2025 PIAA State Championship. She earned NFCA All-Region status after the 2024 campaign and garnered All-Star and All-State accolades in each of the last four seasons.</p>\n                <p>With plenty of new infielders and some returners, there\u2019s no shortage of bats for Penn State\u2019s upcoming season.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Big Ten, being one of the most competitive leagues in college hockey, is nothing new, and with that often comes a grueling conference slate, no matter who\u2019s on the schedule. No. 8 Penn State is set to begin a gauntlet of Big Ten contests, facing three of the top five teams in the next trio of series.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions start by traveling to Madison, Wisconsin, to face the No. 5 Badgers, set for an 8 p.m. puck drop Friday and an 8:30 p.m. puck drop Saturday, both hosted at the Kohl Center.</p>\n                <p>Scouting Wisconsin</p>\n                <p>This is the first time the two teams have met since the blue and white swept the Badgers in the midst of its red-hot second half last season.</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin has been exceeding expectations this season. After finishing with a 7-16-1 conference record last year and debuting at No. 20 in the preseason poll, third-year head coach Mike Hastings has led the Badgers to a consistent top-five spot since late November.</p>\n                <p>Freshman goaltender Daniel Hauser anchors Wisconsin, posting a .913 save percentage and a 2.10 goals against average in his inaugural season.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers\u2019 offense is led by forwards Gavin Morrissey and Quinn Finley.</p>\n                <p>Morrissey paces Wisconsin with a point per game, tallying three goals and 18 assists on the year. The sophomore arrives off a monster first collegiate season, including being named a Hobey Baker Memorial Award fan vote nominee, a top-3 finalist for Big Ten Freshman of the Year and earning a spot on the Big Ten All-Freshman Team.</p>\n                <p>Finley, drafted No. 78 overall by the New York Islanders in 2022, sits in second place with 19 points this season.</p>\n                <p>This won\u2019t be the first time the junior has seen a handful of Nittany Lions this year, as he was a part of the inaugural U.S. Collegiate Selects team that competed in the Spengler Cup back in December, led by Guy Gadowsky.</p>\n                <p>McKenna\u2019s return</p>\n                <p>Penn State star freshman Gavin McKenna ended the first half of the season with 18 points, and while his 14 assists led all first-years nationally, his performance fell short of what many expected the projected No. 1 overall NHL pick this year to do.</p>\n                <p>McKenna spent the holiday break earning a bronze medal with Team Canada in the World Junior Championships, where his four goals and ten assists were good for second in the tournament scoring.</p>\n                <p>Since his return to the blue and white\u2019s lineup, the Whitehorse, Yukon native logged six points in four games, and most recently recorded his first multi-goal game, potting two in the 6-3 win over Notre Dame on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The forward\u2019s newfound momentum earned him the Big Ten Third Star of the Week this week, after pacing all players nationally with five points over the weekend.</p>\n                <p>Injuries loom</p>\n                <p>Penn State has been hit with the injury bug early in its second half.</p>\n                <p>In last weekend\u2019s first contest with Notre Dame, the Nittany Lions were forced to skate only 11 forwards after multiple skaters went down with injuries in the series prior. After defenseman Mac Gadowsky exited early after a hard hit, the blue and white entered without an extra skater for Saturday\u2019s rematch.</p>\n                <p>Charlie Cerrato has been the biggest hole in the blue and white\u2019s roster, leading the team in points before his injury. Guy Gadowsky was hesitant to provide an update for this weekend\u2019s series, labeling him as \u201cdoubtful\u201d.</p>\n                <p>Mac Gadowsky, as well as forwards Shea Van Olm and Casey Aman, who were previously injured, are both still \u201cday-to-day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Miss Behave I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Editor\u2019s Note: Off the record is a weekly column written by a third-year Collegian staffer writing under an alias. It aims to promote a space for honest conversations about love, sex and relationships. Those interested in sharing their experiences or submitting a topic are invited to do so through this anonymous <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN3-6OltwIgABgnHZTEIgmDbsnjaW3yYkbiVVFkdv4vV4m1w/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">form</a>.</p>\n                <p>Dearest reader,</p>\n                <p>This just in, graduating Greta is finding it difficult to feel confident in the dating world as her graduation is quickly approaching.</p>\n                <p>With no clue where she'll be in six months, committing to \u201csomething real\u201d feels nearly impossible. After all, why fall head over heels for someone when there may be a looming expiration date? The mere thought of long-distance with someone she hasn't known that long is enough to make her skin crawl.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHelp?\u201d Well, Greta, you\u2019ve come to the right person.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s the truth no one tells you before graduation: no one knows where they\u2019re going to be in six months. Not you. Not your friends. Not even the 6-foot-5 man in finance with blue eyes, who \u201calready accepted a job offer.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He\u2019ll probably be crying in a Target parking lot by August, questioning capitalism and wondering why he ever chose to flirt with an Excel sheet instead of you.</p>\n                <p>Measuring where we\u2019ll be in six months is almost impossible. So much of our lives change from one season to the next and adding in a romantic partner can turn a simple math problem into an algebraic equation.</p>\n                <p>But here\u2019s the thing: not every relationship needs to survive your entire twenties to be worth starting. Not everyone is meant to be in your life forever. This goes for close friends as well (I had to learn that the hard way).</p>\n                <p>Some people are just meant to be in your life right now \u2014 your coffee date companion or your \u201cwant to come over and watch bad reality TV?\u201d person. And that\u2019s OK.</p>\n                <p>Sometimes dating isn\u2019t about building something permanent, rather it\u2019s about learning what you like, don\u2019t like and how you want to be treated. It\u2019s a reminder that you\u2019re more than just your resume and future plans.</p>\n                <p>You're still allowed to flirt. You're still allowed to feel wanted. And you're certainly still allowed to have fun.</p>\n                <p>Truthfully, yes, things may end when May approaches and you walk across the graduation stage. But that doesn\u2019t make them failures. It just makes them chapters, short chapters that still count toward the full story.</p>\n                <p>You\u2019ll never regret pouring your love into someone when there are mutual feelings involved.</p>\n                <p>On that note, who decided love needed an expiration date anyway? It's not a carton of milk. The deadline exists only because you're the one placing it there.</p>\n                <p>If you meet the right person and choose to date with intention, you and your partner will figure out how to make it work, even if that includes a shared Google calendar and an alarming number of FaceTimes.</p>\n                <p>Love doesn\u2019t end just because graduation is approaching. And neither does your ability to be happy in your romantic life.</p>\n                <p>So get out there and chase whatever, or whoever, you want. Live in the moment. Make connections and meet people. Develop feelings you absolutely didn\u2019t plan on having, because at the end of the day, emotional chaos is still better than feeling nothing at all.</p>\n                <p>Those feelings: butterflies, nerves, excitement and even heartbreak are how we know we\u2019re actually living.</p>\n                <p>Graduating Greta \u2014 I\u2019m wishing you the best of luck this spring semester. Here\u2019s hoping you finally receive your romantic desires. Considering my record, it's hard to imagine you could do worse.</p>\n                <p>Yours truly,</p>\n                <p>Miss Behave</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Ashlyn Kafer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Starting off shaking the floors of their apartment with the vibrations from their music, the members of Sarasota went from playing small gatherings for friends to invigorating hundreds at local fraternity parties and bars in downtown State College.</p>\n                <p>Sarasota is a State College cover band featuring vocalist Adianna Von Wiegand, guitarist Mark Robertson, guitarist and vocalist Jackson Mopsick, bassist and vocalist Ben Swihart and drummer Jacob Cho.</p>\n                <p>The band got its feet on the ground in fall 2024, beginning with Roberston, Mopsick and Cho jamming out together in the living room of their shared apartment.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI got invited to live in this house, and I asked Jacob to come live with me,\u201d Robertson, a fourth-year studying finance and Spanish, said. \u201cThe house was called Sarasota, and it just so happened that Jackson was also living in the house. We hadn\u2019t ever met Jackson until the day we moved in, and he happened to play guitar.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Swihart joined shortly after, completing the foundation of the group. Sarasota took its final form after Von Wiegand partitioned the band for a vocalist spot at a performance at the end of the fall 2025 semester, transforming her musical theater prowess into rock and pop-centric melodies.</p>\n                <p>\u201cRight at the end of last semester, I went to Sig Ep because I was taking my friend on a tour to see all the frats when she was visiting,\u201d Von Wiegand, a second-year studying political science and philosophy, said. \u201cThere was a band playing \u2018Charleston Girl\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Wow, they\u2019re really good, I should totally go up there and make this about myself.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>After playing with the band to test her skills, the members fell in love with her vocals and she was soon welcomed into Sarasota with open arms to begin the spring semester as a lead vocalist.</p>\n                <p>The band takes huge pride in audience enjoyment, tailoring its setlist to tracks that people might be listening to on their walks to class or can sing along to with ease.</p>\n                <p>Tom Petty, Oasis and Bruno Mars are only some of the artists Sarasota pulls from, hoping to ensure its sound can reach diverse audiences and keep listeners engaged throughout the entire performance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEverytime we play a show and play a song that everybody in the crowd is singing and having a great time to, it hits me in my soul,\u201d Swihart, a third-year studying advertising/public relations, said. \u201cI could cry seeing that \u2014 giving the people the opportunity to have fun and just let loose.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Robertson, Mopsick and Cho graduating this spring, the band also tries to ensure that its setlist reflects music the members enjoy producing, translating how they interact with each other during practice onto their audiences when performing live.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPlaying live is such a rush,\u201d Cho, a fourth-year studying materials science and engineering, said. \u201cWe can practice playing the song, or practice twice a week, but when you play it on stage, it\u2019s a completely different feeling. In addition to making a fun atmosphere for everyone, it\u2019s really rewarding. All of us enjoying the songs is a super important aspect of it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sarasota values a lively audience, hoping its energy on stage can power the energy in the crowd. Many of its audience members include close personal friends, roommates and family members, who are appreciated greatly for supporting each show despite constantly hearing a similar setlist.</p>\n                <p>These supporters can be found at the front row of each venue the band plays at, such as Doggie\u2019s Pub, Cafe 210 West, university club formals or off-campus fraternity houses.</p>\n                <p>As the future of Sarasota remains uncertain, the band members want to spend this semester playing as much as they can. They hope to continue reviving the live music scene around State College.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I was a freshman, I didn\u2019t really hear about a lot of live music happening, and I feel like there\u2019s been a big boom of it in the last two years,\u201d Swihart said. \u201cI think if we had any part in that, then that\u2019s really cool just to help that community.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Each member of the band brings different experiences, from formal lessons to teaching themselves their favorite songs for enjoyment.</p>\n                <p>Compiling their individual expertise, passion and drive together, the members have strengthened their ability to learn new music and connect to a wide array of tastes or interests present at each gig.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about live music that forces a community in the room,\u201d Von Weigand said. \u201cEveryone knows the same song and is singing along with the singer, and it really just brings people together in a different way.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A Husky was barking in the cage, and it forced its way out. After containing Washington for 30 of the 40 minutes, the Huskies broke loose, only to flee from the Lady Lions\u2019 grasp.</p>\n                <p>After providing an early scare, Penn State failed to close the game in the second half, falling 81-65. This now marks a 0-9 record in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>The site of Alaska Airlines Arena hosted another ranked matchup for the Lady Lions, who faced No. 25 Washington on the road. As the clock pushed past 9 p.m. on the East Coast, the ball tipped and more of the same mistakes followed.</p>\n                <p>It was a tale of two different teams. En route to its fifteenth win, the Huskies showcased an uncommon threat against Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Averaging 19.3 points per game and co-leading the team in scoring, Gracie Merkle towered over Washington\u2019s Brynn McGauhy. At 6-foot-6, Merkle easily won the tip over the 6-foot-3 McGauhy; however, she subsequently lost the early duel.</p>\n                <p>Coach Tina Langley and the Huskies did their homework against coach Carolyn Kieger and the Lady Lions. The attack point shone bright as Washington attacked the post, drawing Merkle out of the lane.</p>\n                <p>Making her respect the shot, McGaughy's hot shooting sparked a major lead for Washington. Scoring in the double-figures in just the first quarter, Penn State was forced to make adjustments. Making McGaughy the focal point of their defensive effort, the Lady Lions mounted a comeback in the second quarter.</p>\n                <p>Merkle, who leads the nation in field goal percentage, was quiet in the first frame. Then, a sleeping beast awoke. Behind a string of stops on the defensive end, Penn State began to settle in on the other side of the floor.</p>\n                <p>Shaelyn Steele, Nyla McFadden, Tea Cleante and more of Penn State\u2019s guards aided Kiyomi McMiller and Merkle in the comeback pursuit. Penn State endured a run that gave the team a short lead before pulling the team within one point at the end of the half.</p>\n                <p>It was uncharted territory for Penn State \u2013 to be within striking distance \u2013 and it responded with an aggressive attack in the second half. Some might say a little too aggressive, as McFadden picked up a flagrant one foul.</p>\n                <p>Nevertheless, the Lady Lions picked back up where they left off at McMiller, who canned a triple and kept close with the Huskies. In a rather foreseen circumstance, the back-and-forth contest began to dwindle as Washington accelerated on the offensive end.</p>\n                <p>It was a pair of Husky guards that widened the gap early. The Alaskan-native, Sayvia Sellers, led the charge as she tallied 24 points on the night. Exploding in the fourth quarter, Avery Howell got hot from beyond the arc. She finished her night with 13 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n                <p>While McMiller sat in favor of the defense, neither McFadden, Cleante or Steele could contain Sellers and Howell. From a one-point deficit to a sizable lead, Washington had effectively broken free.</p>\n                <p>Penn State didn\u2019t have enough gas in the tank to combat the Huskies\u2019 push. While Washington ranked as one of the better defenses in the nation, Penn State\u2019s guards provided a limited scoring boost to Merkle, who finished with a team-high 19 points.</p>\n                <p>Unable to close tight games has remained a central theme of the Lady Lions\u2019 struggles.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>For the third-straight game, Amiya Evans was out of the lineup. Washington listed Daniella McLean as \u201cout for the season.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After banging her head against the hoop late in the fourth quarter, Merkle left the game and didn\u2019t return. Her status remains questionable.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will continue with its West Coast road trip as it faces Oregon on Saturday at 5 p.m. Following that, the Lady Lions will head back to Happy Valley to face Minnesota to close out their January slate.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Alli Satterfield | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Clubs and representatives involved in Penn State\u2019s entrepreneurship and innovation (ENTI) minor gathered at the Eric J. Barron Innovation Hub for the annual CommunENTI event on Wednesday evening to connect student organizations based in entrepreneurship and promote the minor to more students.</p>\n                <p>The ENTI minor helps students develop \u201cinnovative thinking, leadership skills and management and planning tools,\u201d according to Penn State Undergraduate Education. It consists of 10 concentration areas or \u201cclusters\u201d that help students develop in different disciplines and areas of academic study, which also helps students learn across academic colleges.</p>\n                <p>These clusters provide opportunities for engagement in bio-tech, digital entrepreneurship and innovation, energy transition, entrepreneurship as advocacy, food and bioinnovation, hospitality management, new media, new ventures, product innovation and social entrepreneurship. But, they also provide opportunities for students to create their own startup businesses.</p>\n                <p>Some student business owners, like Hasan Demirgil, the owner of GRND, a protein-coffee company, spoke at the event.</p>\n                <p>Demirgil explained his process in creating his physical product, protein coffee, and the brand people will associate with it. He said he hopes to start placing his product among branch campuses and other storefronts outside of Penn State in the coming year.</p>\n                <p>Other students promoted their creations, like tea and utility apps, as well. These student startup speakers served as evidence of the ENTI program in action.</p>\n                <p>Linda Feltman praised the program's interdisciplinary nature and the ability it gives students to access resources they may not otherwise have. She said many students can have access to the Smeal College of Business they would not otherwise have through the new ventures program.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of Bellisario students that declare the ENTI minor will take the new venture\u2019s cluster,\u201d Feltman, a lecturer in Penn State\u2019s Bellisario College of Communications, said. \u201cWhat\u2019s cool about it is that Smeal is very closed for their upper classes unless you are a Smeal student or unless you are an ENTI minor.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said the program makes Penn State students more attractive to job recruiters by giving them more experience in other disciplines, which not a lot of students have.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou may be learning about hospitality, but you want to understand what advertising does,\u201d Feltman said. \u201cYou\u2019re earning that credit, but it also makes you very attractive to recruiters.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Student organizations were also represented through the night\u2019s events. The Society of Women Engineers, the Blue &amp; White Society, Penn State Music Group, Happy Valley Comm, 46 Live, Penn State Media Commons, Nittany Entrepreneur Society, REACH and more were all present Wednesday night.</p>\n                <p>Amelia Severns, president of the Penn State Music Group (PSMG), was there representing her organization. Although she is not part of the ENTI program herself, Severns praised student entrepreneurs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe focus a lot on entrepreneurship with managing artists,\u201d Severns, a second-year student in Penn State\u2019s science MBA program, said. \u201cWe have a record label team and an educational team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said the club she represents is also a way for students to be involved in entrepreneurship \u2014 especially if they are interested in the music industry \u2014 since Penn State doesn\u2019t offer a specific academic program for that discipline.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe learn about all of the divisions of the music industry, like management, marketing, A&amp;R and production,\u201d Severns said. \u201cWe love to have a point where we can intersect music and business here at Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Many academic clusters were also represented at the event. The food and bioinnovation group offered information and opportunities for prospective students, including the 2026 Ag Springboard Competition.</p>\n                <p>Raymond Yan compared the Ag Springboard Competition to the TV show Shark Tank. He said there, students are able to promote their ideas to win cash prizes, and the only requirement is that one teammate is a member of the agriculture college.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can go in with any idea that\u2019s related to food or agriculture,\u201d Yan, a fifth-year studying agricultural and biorenewable systems management, said.</p>\n                <p>This is just one of the hands-on opportunities offered through the College of Agricultural Sciences. They also have a partnership with the United Nations called the Penn State World Food Forum Youth Lab, which gives students the opportunity to interact with their communities and fields professionally.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s ultimately what the ENTI minor and Wednesday\u2019s program was all about.</p>\n                <p>Students also enjoyed business booths, like Happy Valley LaunchBox, which is powered by PNC Bank, that were there as tangible resources for students on the entrepreneurship path. Throughout the event, students milled about, enjoyed refreshments and networked with students, organization leaders and faculty.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a pretty incredible culture at Penn State as far as entrepreneurship, and it\u2019s one of the reasons students come here,\u201d Feltman said.</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "'You can't be chaotic on offense\u2019 | Mike Rhoades wants Penn State guard Dominick Stewart to play slower",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Guard Dominick Stewart is said to play with a high motor, giving a relentless effort during practices and games.</p>\n                <p>Penn State tracks players\u2019 heart rates in practice, and earlier this season, Mike Rhoades said Stewart is \u201calways\u201d at the top in workload as he \u201cdoesn't take off reps,\u201d citing how hard he practices. Rhoades added that Stewart needed to calm down but still maintain that level of effort, and he revisited the topic at Tuesday\u2019s press conference.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can't be chaotic on offense, especially when you're a shooter,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cIt's hard. You really rush your stuff, and he's so into it. He's so intense. He wants it so bad. I love it. But there's also, as with experience and more game time, you got to learn to pick your spots. I like to say common chaos and offense and be disruptive on defense, and you just got to slow down.\u201d</p>\n                <p>During Big Ten play, Stewart has knocked down 3-point shots at a 20% clip on 30 attempts. He\u2019s had five conference matchups where he was held to less than five points.</p>\n                <p>However, Stewart has reached double figures the past two games, starting with a 16-point outing on 41.7% shooting against UCLA last week. This past Sunday against Maryland, Stewart scored 17 points on 7-of-12 shooting from the field and 3-of-6 from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a nice thing, finally hit some shots,\u201d Stewart said Tuesday. \u201cBut I feel like the shots really don't dictate the game. Like a shot, it takes one second to shoot it. That doesn't define the whole 40 minutes of the game. But yeah, as a scorer, I feel like I put that on myself to go out there and have a good shooting night. I feel that really helps us as a team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Stewart had all three of his 3-point makes come in the first 10 minutes of the second half versus the Terrapins, which is when Penn State cut the lead down to 10 points despite a 96-73 loss. He added four rebounds and four assists during the game as well.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore making three deep shots is the first time he\u2019s knocked down multiple 3-pointers in a game since draining 3-of-5 against NC Central on Dec. 29. It was also Stewart\u2019s first time making at least two 3-point shots against a power-conference team this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cProbably the most frustrating when you put in countless hours, and the results don't exactly come right away,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThat's the frustrating part. But as a shooter, you just got to keep shooting and keep trusting in the work, and eventually it'll come.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Stewart is an active defender, but he\u2019s totaled at least three fouls in each of the last five games, including fouling out against Illinois on Jan. 3. He\u2019s tallied 11 steals this season in addition to numerous deflections.</p>\n                <p>The Ocean Springs, Mississippi, native is averaging 6.9 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game through 18 appearances, including 10 starts. He\u2019s shooting 38.3% from the field, 34.2% from 3-point range and 69.2% at the free-throw line.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe dude cares so much,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI'm going to fight with that dude, and we need him to make shots. We need him to make the right plays. We need him to make shots. And that was a bright side the other day, the way he played defense. I think he got rewarded by slowing down a little bit on offense and knocking some down. So we need that from him moving forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Standing at 6-foot-6, from Mount Washington, Kentucky, Gracie Merkle.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State fans in attendance at the Bryce Jordan Center or Rec Hall over the past two years, they\u2019ve heard that as she\u2019s started all but three games in her Lady Lion career.</p>\n                <p>During that time, Merkle transformed herself into one of the best centers in the Big Ten, if not the nation. This year in particular, she\u2019s led the nation in field goal percentage, shooting at 74.9%.</p>\n                <p>With this accolade and many others in mind, the case has to be made: Can Merkle be the greatest center in Penn State history?</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions haven\u2019t historically been known for their centers. They also haven\u2019t had one standing 6-foot-6.</p>\n                <p>When Merkle joined Penn State in 2024, she immediately played a huge role in the paint, scoring back-to-back 20-point games during her first week in Happy Valley, including a double-double with 13 rebounds in her debut.</p>\n                <p>That success carried over through the rest of her redshirt sophomore year and into this year as she\u2019s on pace to be a top 20-career scorer in Penn State history, excluding her days at Bellarmine.</p>\n                <p>Outside of Merkle, only three other centers have surpassed that 1,490 projected point total, including Vicki Link, Andrea Garner and Kahadeejah Herbert \u2014 the No. 15, No. 13 and No. 7 scorers in school history.</p>\n                <p>However, Merkle has found success outside of just scoring points, that have built her case as the best center in Penn State history.</p>\n                <p>While the 6-foot-6 center is leading the nation by a big margin in field goal percentage, she already has the school record for single-season field goal percentage.</p>\n                <p>Last year, Merkle shot 67% from the court, going 187-for-279. This year, that number has increased significantly to 74.9%, putting a dominant lead over Abilene Christian\u2019s Meredith Mayes, who is shooting 68.2%.</p>\n                <p>Based on just previous centers, Merkle also has a large advantage over former Lady Lions in shooting percentage. Former 6-foot-4 center Amanda Brown holds the No. 3 through No.5 spot in single season field goal percentage with 59.9% and has the career record with 58.9% \u2014 a record Merkle is on track to obliterate.</p>\n                <p>To complete the trifecta, Merkle has also been dominant in rebounding over the last two years.</p>\n                <p>Since joining Penn State, she\u2019s accumulated nearly 400 rebounds and is on track to record 699 career rebounds with the Lady Lions, which would put her at somewhere around the No.15 spot in career rebounds, behind a long list of other centers.</p>\n                <p>However, the current record book includes Merkle\u2019s year at Bellarmine in her career rebounds number, already listing her at 29th. With another 340 rebounds added to her total, Merkle would finish her career in third all-time with 1,039 boards.</p>\n                <p>Despite this high number, Merkle still trails Herbert with career rebounds, who recorded 1,103.</p>\n                <p>While Merkle likely won\u2019t hold the statistical record in every category by the time her Lady Lions days are over, she\u2019ll be far up and have a dominant record with the field goal percentage. In just three years with Penn State, I believe 6-foot-6 Merkle will be the greatest center in Lady Lion history.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Two Doritos Locos Tacos, a quesadilla, a Crunchwrap Supreme, Nachofries, a Blue Raspberry Freeze and a Baja Blast.</p>\n                <p>That was Gavin McKenna and Jackson Smith\u2019s Taco Bell order last Friday after No. 8 Penn State\u2019s 4-1 victory over Notre Dame.</p>\n                <p>Ordering a postgame meal from the iconic taco chain has become a mini tradition for the freshmen duo, who entered the 2025-26 season with lofty expectations. And if you ask them, it was key to their combined six-point night in Penn State\u2019s 6-3 win over the Fighting Irish the next night.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTaco Bell on Friday nights,\u201d McKenna said with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s me and Smitty\u2019s new treat.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Smith said the Crunchwrap Supreme, Nachofries and a Blue Raspberry Freeze he consumed last Friday powered his three-point night \u2014 the first of his collegiate career.</p>\n                <p>The speedy defenseman wouldn\u2019t commit to making Taco Bell a Friday night tradition. He said it\u2019s unlikely for road games, but when in State College for a home series, expect the freshman duo to devour their same order until it stops working.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI mean, it worked last Friday,\u201d Smith said. \u201c(Friday) was the first time we did it. We come out the next night, we win and Gavin and I both have three points. It's a little outrageous for sure, but you gotta love it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Jarod Crespo said \u201coutrageous\u201d is the perfect word to describe his teammates\u2019 Friday tradition. The Nittany Lions\u2019 alternate captain said he would throw up if he ate Taco Bell before a game, and if he ordered fast food before a Saturday tilt, Chipotle is his choice.</p>\n                <p>The clip of McKenna and Smith\u2019s Taco Bell order went viral because many hockey fans appreciated the reminder that while the Penn State freshmen are highly touted NHL prospects, they are also 18-year-old kids enjoying their college experience.</p>\n                <p>But it underscored a deeper connection between the two skaters \u2014 one formed amid a shared spotlight. With McKenna, the consensus No. 1 pick in the 2026 NHL Draft and Smith selected No. 15 by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2025 NHL Draft, lofty expectations followed the duo into college hockey.</p>\n                <p>But those expectations have only made them closer. And that connection has blossomed during the Nittany Lions\u2019 five-game winning streak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's been amazing playing together all year,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting better and better in the second half. We've both been really good offensively and defensively \u2026 I love playing with (McKenna). He's an amazing guy and an amazing player.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Their head coach agrees. Guy Gadowsky has noticed the connection between his star freshmen, both on and off the ice.</p>\n                <p>And as a longtime State College resident \u2014 Gadowsky is in his 14th season as Penn State\u2019s head coach \u2014 he\u2019s glad McKenna and Smith are making the most of their short stint in this small college town.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI did see (their Taco Bell order), but I don't know how to relate to it,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cIt does look like both of them are really enjoying State College and Penn State, and that's important to us. We love seeing that. This is one of the premier college towns in the world, so I'm glad to see they're enjoying it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>To put it simply, Penn State\u2019s defense is a main factor for its 0-7 start in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades said the Nittany Lions have played \u201cpockets of good basketball but not enough to win in the Big Ten.\u201d He cited the defense for those struggles after Maryland earned a 96-73 win over his squad last Sunday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe consistency of our defense has been an issue,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cWe don't play consistently in half-court defense, just enough to get stops and continuous stops, and when we have, we haven't rebounded a high enough clip, getting clean rebounds and one-and-dones to create greater offense.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State lacks a shot blocker on the roster as the team is averaging 1.4 blocks per game. Guard Melih Tunca leads the team with five blocks on the year, with big men Ivan Juri\u0107 and Sa\u0161a Ciani behind him at four blocks apiece.</p>\n                <p>As such, the Nittany Lions have typically used a doubling strategy when an opposing player reaches the interior. But the issue with doubling means that a different player becomes open, and for Penn State\u2019s defense, that opposing player is usually beyond the arc with someone running to cover the open shot.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said the Nittany Lions lose the \u201cpoint of attack\u201d on defense, which is allowing other teams to generate offense.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat it's done is it's put us in rotation,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI don't care at any level of basketball; when you get in the rotation, you're behind, and that has really hurt us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>During the Maryland game, the Terrapins shot 18-of-34 from 3-point range, good for 52.9%. Guard Diggy Coit exploded for 43 points behind 9-of-15 shooting from deep.</p>\n                <p>In Big Ten play, Penn State allows 41.7% of opposing 3-point shots to fall. Earlier this season, the Nittany Lions let up 44 points and 10-of-15 3-point shooting by guard Lamar Wilkerson during a 113-72 loss to Indiana on Dec. 9.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it's a team effort,\u201d wing Eli Rice said Tuesday of improving the perimeter defense. \u201cI think sometimes we leave guys to kind of play one-on-one more than helping that guy. So I'll say it's a team effort, from point guard all the way down to the big man position on the floor. So no matter what position the opposing player is, I think it impacts everybody.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Even if a shot is missed, Penn State hasn\u2019t cleaned up defensive rebounds at a high level. The Nittany Lions average a -7.6 rebounding margin per game across Big Ten matchups.</p>\n                <p>Against Maryland, Penn State allowed 12 offensive rebounds for 16 second-chance points. The Nittany Lions also let up 11 offensive boards for 19 second-chance points during a 71-60 loss to UCLA last week, which Rhoades said was the reason for the result.</p>\n                <p>As Penn State\u2019s season continues, the defense getting better remains arguably the most important area to watch as the team searches for its first Big Ten victory.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe just have to improve with our defense,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe have to improve with our half-court defense, and some of it is just continuing to get more experience and helping some of these guys understand the tough spots we're getting ourselves in there and the why of it.

Yet in his recent outing against the Washington Wizards, didn\u2019t miss a shot as he outplayed former 2024 No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr in the process.</p>\n                <p>The rookie played the next game against the Raptors, and scored five points, all from the charity stripe, but as starting big man Ivica Zuba\u0107 returned to action after injury, Niderh\u00e4user saw his minutes decrease.</p>\n                <p>In the Clippers' recent game, where they again faced the Wizards, Niederh\u00e4user didn\u2019t appear, as Los Angeles returned to full strength. Brook Lopez bumped him in the rotation, as the veteran shoots the lowest field goal percentage of his career.</p>\n                <p>With Lopez's scoring struggles, he and Zuba\u0107 are also two of the least efficient pick-and-roll big men, and as the former Nittany Lion begins to blossom, it isn\u2019t far-fetched to envision a larger role.</p>\n                <p>Jalen Pickett, guard, Denver Nuggets</p>\n                <p>Since Jalen Pickett earned his first start of the season, he\u2019s posted solid outings for the Denver Nuggets and emerged as a solid piece. The Rochester, New York, native started in the last five outings for the Nuggets, and they\u2019ve won four of those contests.</p>\n                <p>In three of those games, Pickett notched double-digit scoring, and in the only loss over that stretch, he potentially put up his best game since his 29-point outing on Jan 5.</p>\n                <p>In the latest game on Jan. 18 against the Chicago Bulls, the Nuggets lost 110-87, yet Pickett had the best plus-minus rating of any Denver starter, behind his 12 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds.</p>\n                <p>After Pickett\u2019s stretch of receiving more playing time, his averages increased to 6.2 points per game, 2.7 rebounds per game, 2.6 assists per game and 46.2% from the field, and he hasn\u2019t missed a free throw all year.</p>\n                <p>Andrew Jones, coach, Toronto 905</p>\n                <p>The lone member of the list not in the NBA or a player, Andrew Jones III, posted the most impressive year of any Penn State alum.</p>\n                <p>The former Nittany Lions forward played in Happy Valley from 2007 to 2011, making 134 appearances during that tenure, though Jones later pivoted to a coaching role.</p>\n                <p>The Philadelphia native had stints as a staff member with the Oklahoma City Thunder, his hometown 76ers, the Detroit Pistons and the Toronto Raptors. In June 2024, he earned his first head coaching gig with Toronto\u2019s G League affiliate, the 905 Raptors.</p>\n                <p>This season, Jones\u2019 squad emerged as a buzzsaw in the G League, posting the best record at 10-2. His squad holds a 14.4-point differential at the start of the year; the next-highest team in the league posts only a 7.9 differential.</p>\n                <p><a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/men_basketball/ex-penn-state-forward-andrew-jones-iii-named-nba-g-league-coach-of-the-month/article_73394251-27bb-48d0-a9e7-f88331f3cbec.html\" target=\"_blank\">In the month of December, Jones earned honors as the top G-League Coach of the Month.</a></p>\n                <p>Jones created a solid squad performance, with many contributors, but his gem has been the development of rookie Chucky Hepburn, the 2025 ACC Defensive Player of the Year.

However, the same can\u2019t be said about the defensive squadron.</p>\n                <p>Former Nittany Lion \u2014 and current member of the Denver Outlaws of the PLL \u2014 Kevin Parnham was a considerable loss for the defense. Despite losing their previous captain, the Nittany Lions returned a veteran group of poles in attempts to make another run at the national title.</p>\n                <p>Defensemen</p>\n                <p>The two biggest returners to the down-low defensive lineup are Alex Ross and Will Costin.</p>\n                <p>Ross, a senior from Davidsonville, Maryland, recorded a career-high 31 ground balls through 17 games in 2025, also forcing 24 turnovers. While it isn\u2019t common for defensemen to have offensive presence, Ross scored his first and only career goal against the Big Red on March 8, helping propel a 13-12 comeback victory.</p>\n                <p>Speaking of defenders who\u2019ve produced points, Costin registered a goal and two assists last season. He tallied a goal in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, where the blue and white defeated Colgate, 13-11. His pair of assists were spread out; the first was notched in the season opener against the Raiders and Costin registered his second in the national semifinal.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions also return senior Max Grube, junior Dillon Torggler, redshirt sophomore Patrick Keenan and redshirt freshman Brad Piffath.</p>\n                <p>Keenan, a Springfield, Pennsylvania, native, appeared in 10 games last season and picked up three ground balls. Grube and Torggler added depth on the bench, each playing in two games. Piffath only appeared in a single game in 2025.</p>\n                <p>In the offseason, Penn State recruited a trio of four-star freshmen defenders.</p>\n                <p>Luke Marra, a 6-foot-1 long pole out of Ridgewood, New Jersey, was ranked the No. 73 prospect in the Class of 2025, according to Inside Lacrosse. Marra played club lacrosse for Building Blocks Lacrosse Elite Black, going 24-16 in 2024.</p>\n                <p>That same publication ranked teammate Paul Bruder, who stands at 5-foot-11, as the No. 94 prospect in the Class of 2025. He previously played for the Episcopal Academy and Team Ten for club.</p>\n                <p>Mark McNamara, a towering 6-foot-5 presence, joins the list of incoming defensive depth and hails from Darien, Connecticut.</p>\n                <p>Long-stick midfielders</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions retained their top two long-stick midfielders in senior Ryan O\u2019Connor and sophomore Lucca DiBartolomeo, while adding three new additions to the youthful depth chart.</p>\n                <p>O\u2019Connor has been a staple of Penn State\u2019s lineup since his freshman campaign in 2023, primarily with his quick retrieval of faceoffs from the wing. In his first season as a Nittany Lion, he scored a goal and picked up 22 ground balls. Last year, he tallied two assists early in the season and scooped a career-high 35 ground balls in 17 games.</p>\n                <p>DiBartolomeo also appeared in all 17 games, registering 21 ground balls and forced seven turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Originally committed to Navy in 2022, four-star recruit Jake Anzelone flipped to Penn State in March. Despite finishing out his high school career with the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Rhode Island, Anzelone played three years with his hometown Seaford Senior High School in New York.</p>\n                <p>Billy Henderson is yet another four-star recruit by Inside Lacrosse. A Springfield, Pennsylvania, native, he committed to Penn State in Sept. 2023. Aharon Bloshuk is the lone three-star recruit from Bangor, Pennsylvania.

    "description": "<p>So, you\u2019re looking into therapy. Congratulations!</p>\n                <p>37% of students nationwide sought therapy or counseling in the past year, according to the 2024-2025 Healthy Minds Study. You\u2019re not alone.</p>\n                <p>Maybe you were one of those students, and you want to explore your options. If you\u2019re new here, maybe this was your New Year\u2019s resolution, you\u2019re finally getting off your parents\u2019 insurance, or like me when I started searching, you\u2019re tired.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately, after you figure out all the financial nonsense and carve out some time, you\u2019re \u2026 at square one. There are so many options, but Pennsylvania (in January, no less) isn\u2019t exactly the mental health capital of the world, so selection can feel simultaneously limited and too broad.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, there are lots of things I\u2019ve noticed my peers don\u2019t know about the whole process, and as students, we don\u2019t often have time to hunt for insight online. But never fear: your resident columnist who\u2019s been through the wringer is back.</p>\n                <p>The first thing I\u2019ve noticed is that, although it\u2019s well-known that every therapist is different, therapy itself is still thought of and presented as monolithic and standardized, something that either works or doesn\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s not the case. There are different modalities and approaches to therapy, and each one might work for different conditions and preferences.</p>\n                <p>The modality you\u2019ve probably encountered, or will, is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. It\u2019s quite common and for me, it was basically what you think of when you hear \u201ctalk therapy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>CBT can be effective for coping with life events like grief and conditions like anxiety, phobias or Obsessive-compulsive disorder, just to name a few, and many people have great experiences.</p>\n                <p>However, I found it didn\u2019t work for me, which leads to my main point here: if a certain modality or approach doesn\u2019t work for you, you aren\u2019t broken or a failure.</p>\n                <p>Various factors can make an approach not fit, and even an adaptable provider who can use many different strategies within a modality can\u2019t make it work for you if it\u2019s not right.</p>\n                <p>In my experience, I found myself leaving even therapists I liked because it just \u2026 wasn\u2019t working. And during that time, I started to think therapy would never work for me.</p>\n                <p>Which, peace and love, sucked.</p>\n                <p>You deal with enough in these four years; you don\u2019t need to feel doomed on top of that.</p>\n                <p>But! The human brain is a complex organ, and so is the therapy world.</p>\n                <p>So, not only are there different types of talk therapy, there\u2019s also somatic therapy, which focuses on the body, music and art therapy and EMDR therapy, which focuses on eye movement to reprocess traumatic memories.</p>\n                <p>There are also subsets and variations to some modalities and approaches, and different therapists may use varying techniques to apply each one.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s no shame in bouncing around to find something you think might work for you.</p>\n                <p>Personally, my therapist uses Internal Family Systems, or IFS, which I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m still skeptical about.</p>\n                <p>Like, they asked me to close my eyes and take a deep breath once, and I all but gagged. But instead of getting offended, they asked me why, and I felt safe enough to tell them:</p>\n                <p>\u201cHonestly, [that request] feels like what people have said to me before insisting essential oils and meditation could cure my eczema. Not implying anything about you, just \u2026\u201d</p>\n                <p>To my surprise (because I was so sure I\u2019d accidentally insulted them), they said they understood why, based on my past, and were happy to send me scientific literature on IFS. And for the first time, I felt recognized as a whole person by a provider.</p>\n                <p>This leads me to my next point: you\u2019re allowed to be (healthily!) skeptical. Therapy isn\u2019t about blindly following someone else\u2019s opinion on how you should live your life, and self-advocacy throughout the process isn\u2019t tantamount to resisting treatment.</p>\n                <p>Honestly, I\u2019d say you should be a little skeptical. I mean, in a February 2025 article, the New York Times reported receiving over 2,700 responses after asking readers if they\u2019ve had any negative experiences with therapy.</p>\n                <p>Considering my own horror stories, I\u2019m not surprised, but Jee-zus. Needless to say, you're allowed to ask questions throughout the entire process, especially as you figure out what\u2019s right for you.</p>\n                <p>Not only can you ask about a therapist\u2019s treatment methods, but you can (and should!) ask about anything that\u2019s important to you and relevant to your treatment, like their approaches toward and professional comfort with identity, medication, clients with certain experiences or conditions and more.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting someone who gets you \u2014 and you\u2019re not alone in that desire. According to a 2017 study conducted by BARNA, 9% of US adults who sought therapy stated that finding a therapist who was similar to them was the most important factor in their search.</p>\n                <p>But if after a session (or a few), you\u2019re just not vibing? Well, a good provider wouldn\u2019t pressure you to work with them if you\u2019re not a good fit \u2014 or pressure you to do anything, for that matter.</p>\n                <p>And the people in your life shouldn\u2019t either.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s a lot I could say about that, but your girl has a word count, so above all, I\u2019d like to emphasize that you define your healing.</p>\n                <p>Just like therapy doesn\u2019t look any one way, neither does growth, and you can\u2019t hold yourself to anyone else\u2019s standards.</p>\n                <p>So, sorry, but your parent who wants you to stop disagreeing with them, your friends who want you to be less of an introvert and your boss who wants you to enjoy working until 2 a.m. might all end up sorely disappointed after your intake session.</p>\n                <p>The most important question is this: Will you?</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

After being named the next Penn State women\u2019s lacrosse coach in May 2025, Treanor will have an opportunity to do the same in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat drive to be a national championship team will never change for her,\u201d Julia Basciano, a midfielder under Treanor at Syracuse and now at Penn State, told The Daily Collegian. \u201cThat is always going to be the expectation and the standard for her.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Treanor\u2019s championship drive started long before her time coaching Penn State, Syracuse and Boston College. The Niskayuna, New York, native became a star with the Orange as a player, becoming one of the most decorated women\u2019s lacrosse players of all time.</p>\n                <p>Under the player leadership of Treanor, Syracuse experienced four straight championship weekends, including a spot in the 2014 NCAA title game.</p>\n                <p>During that stretch, she became the program\u2019s only four-time IWLCA All-American, a three-time Tewaaraton Award finalist and Syracuse\u2019s all-time leading scorer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s just really inspiring from the player that she was in college throughout her whole entire career,\u201d Basciano said. \u201cShe steps out onto the field every day to coach us and motivate us, and she\u2019s very humble about her career. Little does she know that she is an inspiration to probably every single person on our team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Following her time at Syracuse, Treanor spent time with the U.S. women\u2019s lacrosse team, quickly becoming the team\u2019s all-time leader in points and goals. With Team USA, Treanor won gold at the 2017 and 2022 World Championships before retiring and picking up her coaching career at Harvard and Boston College. She ultimately returned to her alma mater in 2022.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy coaching philosophy has changed so much,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cI\u2019ve had really great experiences (at each school) and learned that all the players are so different, so it\u2019s always coming in and trying to understand your players and your team and how they learn best.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite only spending four years with Syracuse, Treanor capitalized on every season with tournament appearances in each of the four years and semifinal appearances in 2023 and 2024.</p>\n                <p>After falling in the second round of the 2025 NCAA Tournament, Penn State vice president of Intercollegiate Athletics Pat Kraft reached out to Treanor about filling the position left by former coach Missy Doherty. The pair already had a connection from their time at Boston College, and Kraft hoped to rekindle that relationship in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn full transparency, I never thought I was leaving Syracuse,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just an opportunity that I absolutely could not pass up. This is such an incredible school, amazing administration and amazing team and players with rich history and success and tradition.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While many teams experience roster turnover following coaching changes, the Nittany Lions held fairly steady, knowing they were getting a high-caliber coach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe always spoke about having a championship culture, but this year, you can actually feel it,\u201d senior attacker Erika Ho told the Collegian. \u201cEveryone has a different drive this year, and that\u2019s kudos to Kayla and the rest of the staff for making and creating a winning culture.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Part of that championship culture comes with Treanor\u2019s coaching philosophy of empowering each individual player and building team passion.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s obsessed with Curt Cignetti right now because he\u2019s an amazing coach and talks so much about one play at a time, and every play is the same and every game is the same,\u201d Treanor said, referencing Indiana football\u2019s national championship-winning head coach. \u201cNothing is too special or too big of a moment for their team, and I think it's similar to my philosophy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Treanor\u2019s philosophy and championship pedigree have resonated not only with the returners at Penn State but also with transfers, including Basciano, who followed her to Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCoach Treanor is just an amazing person as well as an amazing, amazing coach,\u201d Basciano said. \u201cThere really is no other person that I would want to be coached by.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Outside of Treanor\u2019s coaching style and work on the field, her compassion and care for her athletes have been just another thing that motivated the team to play for her.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can tell her, and the entire staff just deeply cares about you, both as a person and a lacrosse player,\u201d Ho said. \u201cBeing around the staff, I feel like I\u2019m a better person, and I think I\u2019ve learned so much in only a few short months being under them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While this kindness and compassion from Treanor and the entire coaching staff have made the team feel welcome, the same has been felt by Treanor as she\u2019s gotten to know her Penn State team after a few months.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTo be honest, I think this is one of my favorite teams I've ever coached,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cI'm just looking forward to continuing to develop my relationships with players and just continue to get to know them, because they are really a special group.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Included in those feelings toward the team is that championship-level pedigree she brings to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Despite never winning the big game, Treanor has the expectations each and every year to be playing for a spot to win a national championship. If she is successful with the Nittany Lions, it will be their first title since 1989.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat excites me the most is just how much they care,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt really means so much to me, just seeing how much work they put in, how much they genuinely care about each and every one of us and how much they care and want to be a winning program.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While it has been nearly 40 years since Penn State\u2019s spot in the history books, Treanor believes that Penn State can make it back and be one of the best programs in the country.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a no-brainer,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cThis is a place where we can win national championships and be one of the Blue Bloods of college lacrosse.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Red and white confetti rained down at Hard Rock Stadium after Indiana won the national championship against Miami.</p>\n                <p>One of the historically worst programs among power conferences and a team that Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza labeled as a \u201cbunch of misfits\u201d went 16-0 and brought a trophy back to Bloomington, Indiana. It made it the third straight seasons a team from the Big Ten won the national title.</p>\n                <p>Long gone are the days where the Big Ten played second fiddle to the SEC. Right now, it\u2019s emerged as the premier conference in college football.</p>\n                <p>Before Indiana, it was Ohio State and Michigan that won the previous two titles. In the four years prior, the SEC won the last four championships with two from Georgia, one from Alabama and one from LSU.</p>\n                <p>From 2020-22, the SEC went 22-15 in bowl games while the Big Ten went 15-13, showing that across the board the SEC not only won the national title, but reached bowl eligibility at a higher rate.</p>\n                <p>From 2023-24, the Big Ten was 17-10 while the SEC posted a 13-11 tally in the postseason.This season, the Big Ten went 11-5 in bowl games while SEC went 4-10. When the two conferences competed against each other, the Big Ten boasted a 3-1 record.</p>\n                <p>The SEC had five teams reach the College Football Playoff, while the Big Ten had three. The Big Ten had two teams with first-round byes in Indiana and Ohio State \u2014 the SEC had one in Georgia.</p>\n                <p>The success from the Big Ten is notable because of the differences in regular-season scheduling \u2014 the Big Ten played nine conference games while the SEC only played eight.</p>\n                <p>Indiana and Oregon became the final Big Ten teams remaining, with the Hoosiers beating the Ducks to punch their ticket to the title game. For the SEC, Ole Miss reached the College Football Playoff semifinal as well, but lost to the Hurricanes.</p>\n                <p>The SEC views playing each other as superior competition, which should benefit their strength of schedule, but in turn this isn\u2019t a reality, as its teams schedule nonconference opponents to essentially set up four free wins.</p>\n                <p>The one extra conference win in the Big Ten provides a tougher task than most of the nonconference schedules SEC teams have, and can be the difference-maker in SEC teams making it into the postseason with one less loss.</p>\n                <p>The aforementioned triumphs are part of the fact that college football\u2019s landscape has clearly changed. There\u2019s a significant amount of money that is being allocated across all conferences with NIL, and the transfer portal gives schools an opportunity to revamp their programs.</p>\n                <p>Still, Curt Cignetti shut down any idea of that helping the Hoosiers win the national title, saying postgame, \u201cour NIL is nowhere near where people think it is, so you can throw that out.\u201d But, he also hinted not so subtly that times are changing as far as who is the cream of the crop in the sport.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCollege football has changed quite a bit, the balance of power also,\u201d Cignetti said.</p>\n                <p>That comment also applies to Indiana as a whole, as the expectation is the Hoosiers\u2019 run won\u2019t be one of a storybook season. Instead, it\u2019ll be the start of continuous runs to the postseason and label as a year in, year out national title contender.</p>\n                <p>After all, the program went from the most all-time losses for power conference programs to winning a national championship in two seasons under Cignetti.</p>\n                <p>The mantra from the SEC is \u201cit just means more.\u201d It means that the play in the conference is above any other league in the country.</p>\n                <p>That phrase held true for a while. Now, it no longer means more. The SEC had its time on the throne, but there\u2019s been a change of power in college football.</p>\n                <p>The Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s 2025 season left much to be desired considering the preseason expectations set for the Nittany Lions, but they did end the season on a four-game winning streak with a Pinstripe Bowl victory.</p>\n                <p>Along the way, some players struggled to meet their ceiling, while others blew past their projections en route to a 7-6 finish with Drew Allar suffering a season-ending injury and James Franklin being fired six games into the season.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s who I\u2019d hand out team awards to.</p>\n                <p>MVP and Offensive Player of the Year: Kaytron Allen, running back</p>\n                <p>Kaytron Allen was Penn State\u2019s engine on offense this season, earning All-Big Ten first-team honors after a year that saw him break the Nittany Lions\u2019 program record for career rushing yards.</p>\n                <p>Allen tallied 1,303 rushing yards in 12 games while averaging 6.2 yards per carry. He put up 195 more yards in 2025 compared to his 2024 year despite having 10 less carries and four less games to play in.</p>\n                <p>The senior began the season in a smaller role behind Nick Singleton despite outproducing his counterpart, but once interim head coach Terry Smith took over, Allen saw a spike in carries and continued his elite year.</p>\n                <p>Allen finished the year with three straight games of over 160 rushing yards, including a career-high 226 yards against Rutgers in the final regular season contest.</p>\n                <p>Defensive Player of the Year: Amare Campbell, linebacker</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defense struggled mightily at different points of the year this season, but linebacker Amare Campbell consistently stood out as his position group struggled without Tony Rojas.</p>\n                <p>Campbell led the team with 103 tackles and 9.5 tackles for loss in his first and only year with the Nittany Lions. He started every game at the MIKE linebacker position for Penn State after transferring in from UNC, providing desperately needed help with thin depth in the room.</p>\n                <p>The Virginia native has since transferred to Tennessee, but Campbell was a major part of any success Penn State\u2019s defense had in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Freshman of the Year: Daryus Dixson, cornerback</p>\n                <p>There was plenty of freshman firepower on Penn State this season, but cornerback Daryus Dixson stood out among the pack.</p>\n                <p>Dixson appeared in every game this year, recording 24 tackles, six pass breakups, two tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble.</p>\n                <p>The freshman was one of just two players at the beginning of the year to earn a green light to burn his redshirt, and he started two games in 2025, including the Pinstripe Bowl win.</p>\n                <p>Most Improved Player: Andrew Rappleyea, tight end</p>\n                <p>A season-ending injury in 2024 derailed any chance for Andrew Rappleyea to have a breakout year, but he came back this year as the No. 3 tight end behind Khalil Dinkins and Luke Reynolds.</p>\n                <p>Rappleyea wound up making a name for himself and proved to be a must-retain player after a hot end to the year. The tight end had a touchdown in each of Penn State\u2019s last three games and finished with 180 yards across the season.</p>\n                <p>Assistant of the Year: Anthony Poindexter, safeties coach</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s coaching staff left much to be desired this season, but Anthony Poindexter led safety Zakee Wheatley to the best year of his career and helped King Mack turn in a solid 2025.</p>\n                <p>Poindexter also called plays in the Pinstripe Bowl for the Nittany Lions, and the defense performed exceptionally well, allowing just 10 points to Clemson.</p>\n                <p>The Virginia alumnus won\u2019t be with Penn State next season as he embarks to Tennessee, but he finished his career in the blue and white with a great coaching campaign.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Per a new tradition, Penn State will return to its last venue before the Bryce Jordan Center, Rec Hall, to face the Wisconsin Badgers.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers arrive off a dominant 13-5 record, while the Nittany Lions sit at an even 9-9.</p>\n                <p>Beyond those records, the tale of the tape begins to tell a very different narrative between the squads.</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall rebounding</p>\n                <p>This occasion marks the third consecutive year the Nittany Lions have hosted the promotion, with an even record in both games.</p>\n                <p>Home turf remains a fortress for Penn State this season, as it holds the third-highest home rating in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Last season, it received an 83-64 thumping at the hands of rival Ohio State, and most of the stat figures went the Buckeyes\u2019 way, especially rebounding, where they held a 41-23 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Although in the inaugural \u201cReturn to the Rec\u201d in 2024, results went differently, Penn State upset No. 12 Illinois in a 90-89 nail-biter, yet the trend of opposition domination on the glass continued, as the Fighting Illini posted a 49-25 rebounding advantage.</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall rebounding looks to go to a foe for a third straight season, as Wisconsin tied for eighth in the conference, while the Nittany Lions sit dead last in the Big Ten in rebounding per game.</p>\n                <p>Badgers\u2019 7-footer Nolan Winter leads the approach on the glass with 8.7 rebounds per game, a top-five figure, while his defensive rebounding stands only second in the Big Ten to standout Washington forward Hannes Steinbach.</p>\n                <p>Wondrous Wisconsin</p>\n                <p>The Badgers arrive in Happy Valley with possibly their best streak of basketball played this season, as they ride a four game win streak. Over the last ten outings, Wisconsin holds a 7-3 record, with two losses to the top two Big Ten teams, Nebraska and Purdue, and an overtime defeat to Villanova.</p>\n                <p>Form favors the Badgers, and the results came against both top and bottom-level performers, indicating that Wisconsin isn\u2019t one to play down to opponents. Wisconsin\u2019s best result came three games ago on Jan. 10 when it upset No. 2 Michigan 91-88 to give the Wolverines their first loss of the year.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers shot under 40% only three times this year, and recently those offensive woes haven\u2019t persisted: they shot over 40% from beyond the arc in their last three games. The defense for Wisconsin remained solid over this stretch, although it can be susceptible to allowing opponents to break expected scoring averages.</p>\n                <p>Scoring stars</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin enters Rec Hall with the fourth-highest scoring total offense in the Big Ten, but also has the fourth-most points allowed.</p>\n                <p>Leading the Badgers' offensive effort is a pair of top-ten conference scorers, Nick Boyd and John Blackwell, who are comfortable scoring both inside and beyond the arc.</p>\n                <p>Blackwell is prone to hit or miss outings, as he has the lowest field goal percentage out of all top-15 conference scorers. However, the Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, native logged a tied Big Ten second-best single-game scoring mark this season, with his 31 points against Campbell in November.</p>\n                <p>Penn State also faced Campbell, and while it couldn't match the dominant fashion of Wisconsin's 96-64 win, it also saw a single-game stardom from its own guard, as Kayden Mingo scored 21 points in an 87-76 win.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions return to Rec Hall with full offensive strength, as both players listed as questionable before the last game, Mingo and Freddie Dilione V, who lead Penn State in scoring, both appeared in its last contest. Dilione may see load management, however, as an ankle injury suffered against UCLA continues to nag him.</p>\n                <p>Against the Camels, three Penn State players joined Mingo in scoring more than 15 points, while only Boyd and Winter joined Blackwell in the Badgers meeting against Campbell in reaching such a feat.</p>\n                <p>Tempo in this one should be a big factor, as both Penn State and Wisconsin rank inside the top half in the Big Ten for Evan Miyakawa\u2019s tempo rating.</p>\n                <p>Don\u2019t expect great defensive teams either, as the Badgers rank the sixth worst in the conference, while the blue and white sit at the bottom, with the only negative team defensive rating in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Following a dominating performance against Iowa and Northwestern last weekend, Penn State faces Indiana and Maryland in their final two-dual weekend of the season.</p>\n                <p>Prior to the upcoming matchups, Cael Sanderson met with the media to discuss how the Penn State wrestling program has seemingly lapped the competition while approaching an 80-match winning streak.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he had to say.</p>\n                <p>No closing the gap</p>\n                <p>After dropping nine out of their last 10 matches to Penn State, Hawkeyes\u2019 coach Tom Brands commented on how they\u2019ve never been beaten like that. The loss was a metaphor for how Penn State has separated from the pack of elite wrestling programs. Sanderson offered insight for why he believes the program has sustained such dominance.</p>\n                <p>In a changing landscape of wrestling, featuring NIL and high schoolers reclassifying to join the college ranks early, Sanderson focuses on recruits joining Penn State \u201cfor the right reasons,\u201d rather than just searching for a paycheck.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur kids know that they are coming here to become the best wrestler they can possibly be,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cKids are coming here, with very high character, wanting to be the best wrestlers in the world.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson drove home the sentiment, saying that top recruits and their families know Penn State will drive its team to be the best both on and off the mat. He wants that to be the factor that drives commitments, rather than other motivations.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe do our best to follow the rules,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cSo although (the NIL era) seems like an advantage for others, I think it\u2019ll be an advantage for us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Team chemistry</p>\n                <p>One benefit of recruiting the high-quality characters Sanderson spoke about is developing a locker room culture that he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d He credits the roster as well as the long-term chemistry developed by the program over the last decade plus. Sanderson further credits the families of the wrestlers for raising them into men that make the team as bonded as they are.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust a lot of good kids that could have named their price at another but are here because of what the program stands for,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>During the Iowa dual, the Nittany Lions\u2019 bench was shown throughout the match supporting their teammates inside a volatile Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Sanderson acknowledged his team\u2019s \u201cbigger than yourself\u201d mentality and genuine support for each other. Sanderson concluded by saying that coaching \u201cwouldn\u2019t be fun\u201d without a team like Penn State.</p>\n                <p>New starters</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze, PJ Duke and Cole Mirasola all picked up marquee victories over the weekend. Forgoing the usual talk after performances like theirs, Sanderson focused on each wrestler\u2019s character rather than technical ability.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson credited the trio as being able to be themselves when they wrestle and being elite competitors. All three wrestled opponents they can expect to see late in the NCAA tournament, on the biggest stage they\u2019ve wrestled on in their collegiate career and maintained composure.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe bigger the moment, the better they\u2019re going to wrestle,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019ve done their whole lives and what we do as a program.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For Mirasola, Sanderson dove in on his toughness and training. After Josh Barr described Mirasola as \u201cnasty\u201d during a press conference, Sanderson clarified that Mirasola can bring out an animalistic side when the whistle blows, while remaining a good person and wrestling within the rules. Sanderson said it boils down to Mirasola having to fight for everything he\u2019s earned to this point.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been a great athlete that didn\u2019t have to fight for things,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>He also dove deep on Mirasola\u2019s training, crediting Lucas Cochran for his relationship with his weight-class partner, as well as former Nittany Lion Greg Kerkvliet and \u201cthe heavyweight tamer\u201d in assistant coach Casey Cunningham for their roles in developing the redshirt freshman.</p>\n                <p>Despite the praise, Sanderson doesn\u2019t expect his wrestlers to get complacent, especially after just a dual victory. His focus is keeping the roster focused on the future, improvement and larger accolades later in the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s patting themselves on the back or anything,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cAs much as seeing what we can do better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh</p>\n                <p>After his tiebreaker victory over the former No. 1 Angelo Ferrari, Rocco Welsh staked his claim at the top of a loaded 184-pound weight class. Sanderson spoke about his time recruiting Welsh out of Pennsylvania prior to college and seeing his potential. The coach specifically acknowledged his ability to listen, his preparation and his toughness.</p>\n                <p>However, Sanderson didn\u2019t speak too deeply into the victory itself, focusing on the next steps as he always does when asked about Welsh\u2019s No. 1 status.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t win Nationals in January,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After remaining at No. 4 in the USCHO poll for another week, the Nittany Lions concluded their seven-game road trip against the twelfth-ranked Cornell Big Red as they finished their home-and-home series of the 2025-26 season.</p>\n                <p>The blue-and-white did so without its lone goalscorer from their game against Cornell just before the end of the 2025 calendar year, Matilde Fantin. Fantin was recently named to Italy\u2019s Women\u2019s Hockey team for the 2026 Winter Olympics, joining fellow Olympians Tessa Janecke (United States) and Nicole Hall (Sweden).</p>\n                <p>However, what Penn State lost in Fantin, it gained in goaltender Katie DeSa, who made her first start since Jan. 2 when she left after the second period with an injury in Penn State\u2019s 5-1 loss to Ohio State. DeSa shutout the Big Red in December\u2019s contest, the 20th of her career, tying her with Josie Bothun (\u201824) for the most in program history.</p>\n                <p>DeSa performed to her standard, leading the Nittany Lions to a 5-1 win in a mid-week matchup in the final non-conference game of the season.</p>\n                <p>The senior netminder extended her shutout streak against Cornell to four periods after blanking them in the opening frame, stopping all eight shots she faced. She passed the first test she faced with ease, turning away multiple one-timers on a Cornell power play after the officials assessed Leah Stecker for a minor cross-checking penalty.</p>\n                <p>Penn State struck first with a goal off the stick of Janecke, her 17th of the season. Katelyn Roberts battled Cornell\u2019s Nora Curtis for the puck along the boards, ultimately forcing a turnover in Penn State\u2019s offensive zone. Janecke was able to pick up the loose puck and score on a shot from the faceoff dot to the right of the Big Red goaltender Annelies Bergmann.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions captain extended her point streak to six games with goals in each of the last four. Janecke extended her AHA goal-scoring lead and entered a tie for the sixth most in the nation with three other skaters.</p>\n                <p>Cornell was able to regroup during the first intermission and didn\u2019t waste any time in the second period, evening things at 1-1 just shy of 90 seconds into the period. The Big Red\u2019s Shannon Pearson picked up the puck in the neutral zone and entered her offensive zone in a 2-on-2 situation and beat DeSa under the blocker from the slot for her third goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>Just moments later, the carnelian-and-white took advantage of another Nittany Lion defensive collapse when Avi Adam entered the zone on a breakaway. Yet a diving attempt from Abby Stonehouse forced Adam to quickly recover and shoot, missing wide of the net.</p>\n                <p>After a series of multiple icing calls against the blue-and-white, Janecke circled back into her own zone and led a rush the other way and dumped the puck into the Cornell zone. Taya MacDonald was able to stop a clearing attempt from leaving the zone and found Maddy Christian coming up the boards, who received the pass, turned and ripped a shot that was deflected in front by Grace Outwater to give Penn State its second lead of the game, 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Outwater has now scored in three straight games and totaled 16 on the season, matching her career-high from last season in 15 fewer games. Her 27 points on the season set a new career-high for the sophomore winger.</p>\n                <p>With just over six minutes remaining in the second period, Cornell nearly knotted the score again, but a pass sent too wide left the Big Red looking for another opportunity.</p>\n                <p>They wouldn\u2019t see it in the second period as the blue-and-white continued to keep its foot on the gas with Christian leading the way, but came up short after being denied by Bergmann on two scoring opportunities.</p>\n                <p>After struggling to exit their own zone in the second, the third-period Nittany Lions continued to build momentum and controlled the puck well, maintaining possession in the Cornell zone. Roberts chipped the puck up to Janecke, who dished a cross-ice pass to a wide-open Stonehouse, who tapped in her sixth goal of the season with ease.</p>\n                <p>Penn State continued its dominance in the first half of the final period, outshooting Cornell 6-1 with its lone shot-on-goal coming on the second unsuccessful man-advantage of the night.</p>\n                <p>Continuing to challenge Bergmann from the middle of the slot between the two faceoff circles, Sophie Morrow extended the Nittany Lions\u2019 lead to three with her third goal of the season. With an assist from Kendall Butze, the Penn State defense remains one of the best in the country, breaking a tie for second in defensive scoring.</p>\n                <p>After being denied multiple times at the end of the second period, Christian netted her 14th goal of the season with no challenge on an empty-net goal.</p>\n                <p>With this win, Penn State finishes its non-conference play with a record of 7-3. Overall, Penn State improved its record to 22-4, giving the Nittany Lions the most wins in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will return home to Pegula Ice Arena, where they will host the Delaware Blue Hens for a weekend series beginning on Friday at 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE WOMEN'S HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 8 Penn State is 16-6 and winners of five straight games behind stout goaltending from Josh Fleming and multi-point nights from Gavin McKenna and Jackson Smith.</p>\n                <p>Following the Nittany Lions\u2019 series sweep of Notre Dame, coach Guy Gadowsky spoke with the media on Tuesday about injuries, his goaltending plans and his team\u2019s upcoming series against No. 5 Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>Injury updates</p>\n                <p>Penn State ranks second in the Big Ten standings after sweeping Minnesota and Notre Dame. But its recent success came at a cost.</p>\n                <p>Charlie Cerrato and Braeden Ford exited with injuries against the Golden Gophers and didn\u2019t play against Notre Dame. Gadowsky said last week that Ford will miss \u201ca significant amount of time\u201d and labeled Cerrato as \u201cday-to-day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky was hesitant to provide an update on Cerrato, the team\u2019s co-assist leader, before he labeled him \u201cdoubtful\u201d for this weekend\u2019s series against the Badgers.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m not 100% confident in giving you an update, but (Cerrato is) doubtful for this weekend,\u201d Gadowsky said.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions had so many injuries at forward entering last weekend\u2019s series that they didn\u2019t list a fourth-line right winger for Game 1 and omitted an extra skater from their lineup sheet in Game 2.</p>\n                <p>Mac Gadowsky, who exited Friday\u2019s victory after taking a hard hit along the boards and missed Saturday\u2019s contest, Shea Van Olm and Casey Aman are \u201cday-to-day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Goaltending plans</p>\n                <p>Penn State has used a goaltending tandem between Fleming and Kevin Reidler in 10 of its 11 series this season. And through 22 games, both rank inside the top six in goals-against average and save percentage among Big Ten goalies \u2014 a key reason Gadowsky\u2019s waited to name a true starter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI believe we're going to continue (both goaltenders) because it seems to be working very well,\u201d Gadowsky said. What we like most is that the goaltending trio supports each other. They're a great example of what teamwork is.\u201d</p>\n                <p>But Fleming has separated from his counterpart since the start of Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>In 10 starts, the freshman netminder sports a 1.82 goals-against average, which far outpaces Reidler\u2019s 2.92, and a conference-best 94.3 save percentage. He has stopped 86 of the 88 shots he\u2019s faced in his three starts since the international break.</p>\n                <p>Despite Fleming\u2019s impressive production, Gadowsky declined Tuesday to name him the starter, instead praising the success of the tandem.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a good thing going on right now, and I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but right now, (the goaltending tandem) is one thing that's really going well. I don't know why we try to fix something that's not broken.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Blocking the noise</p>\n                <p>The outside noise has been loud surrounding McKenna, the consensus No. 1 pick in the 2026 NHL Entry Draft. That wasn\u2019t a surprise.</p>\n                <p>But the way he\u2019s handled that pressure earned praise from his head coach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOne of the things that I admire most about (McKenna) is that he really doesn't listen to the noise, and he has a confidence about him, regardless of what some people say on some website,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI admire his internal compass. He\u2019s really been raised well by his family, by his community, to stay level-headed and worry about what he controls.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McKenna tallied his first multi-goal game in Penn State\u2019s 6-3 victory over Notre Dame last Saturday. His offensive output has ballooned since his return from international play, which left Gadowsky more impressed than surprised.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou look at the World Junior Championships, (McKenna) was one point from the lead and just turned 18,\u201d Gadowsky said. He\u2019s doing incredibly well, and we see him getting better every day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

However, it lost to struggling Purdue earlier in January.</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and the Huskies have a strong trio that contributes to most of their team\u2019s scoring.

Through 11 weeks, Merkle has averaged nearly 75% shooting from the court, scoring 19.3 points per game.</p>\n                <p>To go along with Merkle\u2019s power in the paint has been shifty Kiyomi McMiller, who\u2019s averaged 19.4 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Rounding out Penn State\u2019s big three is redshirt junior Moriah Murray, who has the second-most made 3-pointers in the Big Ten this season, making 55 triples.</p>\n                <p>With a star-studded trio in both lineups, Wednesday\u2019s matchup will likely come down to which team can get better opportunities from the bench.</p>\n                <p>Oregon</p>\n                <p>While Saturday\u2019s matchup won\u2019t be another top-25 matchup for the Lady Lions, it will be another contest against a premier Big Ten team who\u2019s had big wins this season.</p>\n                <p>Sitting at 14-6, Oregon had its fair share of celebrations this year with wins against then-No. 21 USC, Oregon State and Auburn. However, it\u2019s on its own losing streak with three straight losses to Michigan State, Iowa and Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State searches for its first win since December 20th \u2014 losing eight straight \u2014 the Ducks have more recent victories they can still garner momentum from.</p>\n                <p>Oregon\u2019s defense will be the biggest struggle for the Lady Lions, recording 11.8 steals per game.</p>\n                <p>Despite scoring just 6.1 and 7.4 points per game, Oregon\u2019s Ari Long and Sofia Bell have started all a majority of games this year, mainly due to their defensive toughness.

    "title": "Penn State notebook | Mike Rhoades talks building a program, morale of team amid losing streak",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State remained winless in Big Ten play after a 96-73 loss to Maryland this weekend, and Mike Rhoades returned to the podium for his weekly press conference on Tuesday.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades spoke on what goes into building a program, the morale of his team amid its losing streak and more as the schedule continues with a home game against Wisconsin on Thursday.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what Rhoades had to say.</p>\n                <p>Building a program</p>\n                <p>Indiana won a national championship in football on Monday night after never having much success in the sport. Prior to the Hoosiers\u2019 recent run, comparisons could\u2019ve been made between Penn State men\u2019s basketball and Indiana football as both weren\u2019t known as consistent winning programs.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said he\u2019s watched the Hoosiers\u2019 turnaround in football under head coach Curt Cignetti closely, saying he tried to learn their approach of bringing potential sustainable success to a program.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think their organization, their commitment, the decisions they've made to be able to go to bat in the big boy batter's box has paid a dividend for them and put them in the position that they're in,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSo it's a lot of decisions, a lot of conversations you got to have, and then you got to go do it, and they did it, pretty impressive.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said recruiting and retention of high-level players is one aspect in particular he thinks can expedite building a program. Penn State has freshman guard Kayden Mingo, who is the highest-rated recruit in program history.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're recruiting high-level dudes. We got to get them. We got to retain them,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThe ones we have in our program that want to be here and do it the right way. We got to retain them. This is hard, and when you're losing everyone has answers or questions and all that stuff, but they're not in the building with us every day as we're trying to do this the right way and build it the right way.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are a finalist for 5-star 2026 guard Dylan Mingo, who ranks as the No. 5 player nationally by the 247Sports composite. Rhoades was asked if he thinks Penn State is currently in a position to land the highest levels of talent out of high school.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNot yet, but I have belief that we will, and we're moving forward,\u201d Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Morale of team</p>\n                <p>Penn State has lost its last five games and eight of its last nine matchups. The losing skid has included blowout losses and close contests that saw the Nittany Lions nearly pulling off upsets.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said the players are still working to get their first win in the Big Ten slate and have been coachable.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTo give them the respect I have for them and the way they're handling,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI mean, guys are disappointed and upset, but we don't have issues off the court or things that are getting in the way of what we're trying to do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions haven\u2019t won since a 90-67 victory over NC Central on Dec. 29, and they haven\u2019t beaten a power-conference opponent this year, as all nine of their wins came against. Quad 4 teams.</p>\n                <p>Still, Penn State\u2019s roster, which has eight freshmen, is impressing Rhoades in still putting in effort despite the season being off to a rough start.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have some young guys that are in big positions that a lot's on them, but win or lose, whatever the scenario is, if you keep learning from it, it's going to make you better,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIt's just hard. I mean, come on, it is where we are, but I've been proud of the guys for their response, especially with the morale.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Puff Johnson playing for Ohio State</p>\n                <p>Former Penn State forward Puff Johnson, who has already played in five seasons of collegiate basketball, transferred to Ohio State in the fall and was given a temporary retraining order, making him immediately eligible to play.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades spoke on the possibility of Johnson playing for the Nittany Lions this year, but it didn\u2019t work out.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPuff and I spoke about that, and we knew we were going to have a scholarship,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSo if he was eligible to come back, he had a scholarship. That changes with (revenue) share and NIL because we're not in a position where we can just lose money and all that stuff \u2026 We all moved on in a positive way without a doubt. He's a Penn State grad, and he gave us everything for two years. I really appreciate (him). He's a good kid.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall game</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are set to host Wisconsin inside Rec Hall at 7 p.m. Thursday. It\u2019ll be a change from the usual site of the Bryce Jordan Center, bringing back an old-school look.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe all love a little throwback in us, right?\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIt's an old arena. It's an old gym. People are on top of you now with the new court and the way it's configured, even more on top of you. I just think it's cool. Penn Staters love something different. I think sometimes being different and doing something cool like that is fun, fun for everybody.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to the Bryce Jordan Center opening, Penn State used to host its home games in Rec Hall from 1929-96, holding a record of 514-183. Rec Hall has a listed capacity of 6,846, and with bleachers close to the court, the atmosphere sounds louder than the typical game at the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Since Rhoades took over as the Nittany Lions\u2019 coach in 2023-24, Penn State has hosted a \u201cReturn to Rec\u201d promotion, which features one game inside Rec Hall per season. Notably, Penn State took down No. 12 Illinois on Feb. 21, 2024, by a score of 90-89 after game-winning free throws by forward Zach Hicks.</p>\n                <p>Fans stormed the court after the Nittany Lions\u2019 upset over the Fighting Illini.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is entertainment, right? And it's supposed to be about having a cool experience,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cYeah, we want to win, and we want to do everything right, but we also want to make some decisions, so we're having a lot of fun trying to do this. I think playing in Rec Hall for a lot of people, old Penn Staters, new Penn Staters, basketball fans, it's a cool place to see a college basketball game, and it's cool for our players to be a part of that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said it\u2019s a possibility to play more than one game per season at Rec Hall, but noted the logistical needs of playing more games in the historic site.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of things come into play with moving a team or a program out of one building to another, and logistics and how much it impacts,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThen you have marketing and ticket sales and season ticket sales. I think there's a lot more to it than just say, \u2018Hey, let's go play.\u2019 Some of that is above my pay grade.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg & Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Is it time to pull the plug?</p>\n                <p>The Carolyn Kieger experiment has been a long-awaited process, as the winning culture has yet to be established. Now, in her seventh season, the pieces still do not fit.</p>\n                <p>In the midst of a dreadful season, Penn State holds a 7-12 record and is yet to secure a Big Ten win. This poses an important question: Does Kieger deserve another chance?</p>\n                <p>Noah Aberegg: A case for Kieger</p>\n                <p>While some are calling for Kieger's firing or for the entire basketball program to be dismantled, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the right time.</p>\n                <p>Sure, she\u2019s only produced one winning record in her six years with Penn State, with another to come. But given the current roster for the Lady Lions, one more year with the Marquette alum at the helm won\u2019t do much harm. In fact, it might be just what the blue and white need.</p>\n                <p>Throughout Kieger\u2019s time at Penn State, she hasn\u2019t had an established group of stars as she does now. Makenna Marisa was there for five years, but cycled through Leilani Kapinus, Ashley Owusu and Shay Ciezki.</p>\n                <p>This year, the Lady Lions have Kiyomi McMiller, Gracie Merkle, Moriah Murray, and a young handful of supporting cast members.</p>\n                <p>Besides Amiya Evans and Vit\u00f3ria Santana, the other nine athletes on Kieger\u2019s roster will have the opportunity to play again next year. If and when they do, that lineup will have another year of training and chemistry under its belt.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will be joined by incoming freshman Chikae Desdunes, the No. 51 athlete in the Class of 2026. McMiller will have another year to work on patience, control and shot selection, Merkle can improve on her defense and strength and the five current freshmen \u2014 all of whom have shown potential this year \u2014 will have a full year of college experience.</p>\n                <p>If Kieger retains her current roster and still produces the same results next year then it could be time to move on. Murray, Merkle and Maggie Mendelson will graduate, and McMiller likely won\u2019t stick around if her final year is to be a year of misery, given her star potential.</p>\n                <p>While people have said every year, \u201cThis is the Lady Lions\u2019 year,\u201d I believe it\u2019ll come next season, and if it doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s go time for Kieger.</p>\n                <p>Sam Simonic: The case against Kieger</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s time for her to go.</p>\n                <p>Any supporter of the Nittany Lions\u2019 football program understands the Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics, Pat Kraft doesn\u2019t mess around. When it comes to an underperforming coach at the helm, Penn State is forced to respond accordingly. And, rightfully so.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white hold prestige to its name. Beyond the court, Penn State athletics has cemented itself as a perennial power in nearly every sport.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not that Penn State is immune to down seasons, but rather it doesn\u2019t have consistent losing streaks. In basketball, and specifically in women\u2019s basketball, that standard has not been met. That is the dangerous part of keeping Kieger around.</p>\n                <p>Trial and error mark the brief adjustment period for any new coach in Happy Valley. However, a turnaround is expected in just a couple of years. In her seventh season, Kieger has made minimal improvements. If anything, it\u2019s gotten worse.</p>\n                <p>Kieger didn\u2019t fall under the Kraft umbrella. In fact, she was hired in 2019 under the direction of former Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics, Sandy Barbour. At the time, Kieger was viewed as an exciting hire, coming off much success at Marquette.</p>\n                <p>However, that success did not follow her to Penn State. Kieger was in charge of changing a struggling program. In many ways, a short-term rebuild was expected. But, season after season, few improvements were seen.</p>\n                <p>Across her time in State College, Kieger has only produced one winning season. That came in the 2023-24 season when the Lady Lions went 22-13 and made the WBIT. Since that season, Kieger has appeared to hit a plateau, having now tallied two of the worst seasons in her career, including this season.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, we are now in mid January and the Lady Lions are still without a Big Ten win, even after facing Rutgers, which was winless in the Big Ten, at home. A change certainly wouldn\u2019t guarantee rapid success, but it would give Penn State the full green light to embrace a rebuild.</p>\n                <p>Kieger was never able to do a rebuild, and it's evident. At this point, Penn State should search for a coach who can do just that.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s basketball entered last week's slate with two more chances to earn its first Big Ten win. The Lady Lions traveled to Columbus, Ohio, hoping to upset a ranked Ohio State for the second straight year. The blue and white also hosted a Rutgers team that was winless in conference play.</p>\n                <p>Coach Carolyn Kieger's squad couldn\u2019t get the job done in a blowout loss to the Buckeyes and fell just short in a close battle with the Scarlet Knights.</p>\n                <p>Penn State stands 7-12 on the season and 0-8 in the Big Ten. Even though the Lady Lions went winless, there were still both good and bad takeaways from the week.</p>\n                <p>Merkle stays efficient</p>\n                <p>Gracie Merkle has been consistent from the field all season and owns the nation's highest field-goal percentage at 74.9%. Despite the two losses, the 6-foot-6 center kept her efficiency.</p>\n                <p>The Mount Washington, Kentucky, native shot a combined 17-for-22, netting 21 points in each outing. Merkle impressed against No. 14 Ohio State, shooting 90.9% from the field, while also grabbing 11 rebounds to complete her double-double performance.</p>\n                <p>Against Rutgers, the redshirt junior wasn\u2019t as efficient from the field, but took multiple trips to the free-throw line, going 7-for-10. This ties Merkle\u2019s season high trips to the charity stripe, and was her third-best foul shooting performance this season.</p>\n                <p>Defense</p>\n                <p>On the defensive side of the ball, it was the tale of two stories for the Lady Lions. The blue and white gave up 108 points against the Buckeyes, marking its most points allowed this season. Penn State scored 84 points in the matchup, which would\u2019ve been enough to win more than half its games this season.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State led from start to finish and led by as many as 26 points. The Buckeyes shot over 56% from the field and just under 50% from three-point range. However, the Lady Lions forced 17 turnovers, including 11 steals.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white improved defensively against Rutgers, falling by a score of 76-72. The Scarlet Knights\u2019 scoring total fell under the 82.1 points per game that Penn State typically allows.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions held Rutgers to a 40.6% field-goal percentage and 36% from three-point range. The blue and white recorded eight steals and forced 12 turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Offensive struggles</p>\n                <p>Penn State posted strong scoring numbers and even exceeded its typical points-per-game average, but the Lady Lions also showed room for improvement.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white combined for 36 turnovers in its last two games, but 24 of those came against Ohio State. The Buckeyes capitalized on Penn State\u2019s struggles by scoring 39 points off turnovers. Additionally, Ohio State was able to net 27 fastbreak points. The Lady Lions only scored 11 points off 17 Buckeye turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Penn State shot over 46% from the field, but went 11-for-32 from beyond the arc and 3-for-9 from the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions had a better outing against the Scarlet Knights, in which they turned the ball over 12 times, which is their third-lowest mark this season. However, the blue and white only produced nine points off opponent turnovers as opposed to Rutgers\u2019 18.</p>\n                <p>Penn State produced a similar shooting performance to the one before, but once again struggled from deep and the foul line. The Lady Lions shot 5-for-25 from three-point range against Rutgers, and Moriah Murray, who went 8-for-17 from deep against the Buckeyes, shot 1-for-9 against the Scarlet Knights.</p>\n                <p>In that Rutgers game, at the charity stripe, the blue and white went 11-for-18, losing by just four points.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Two suitcases in hand, a twenty-pound backpack weighing me down and a Lululemon fanny pack slung around my chest, I wove past the Spaniards in the Barcelona streets.</p>\n                <p>Even after a 12-hour trip, consisting of a quick layover in Dublin, Ireland, my body was spent and my mind blown once I arrived in Barcelona, Spain. But I was still able to run laps around the locals. My back ached, and all I wanted was a nap, but it didn\u2019t stop me from being one of the faster walkers on the street.</p>\n                <p>Hands held relaxed behind their back, or a cup of coffee and a cigarette in hand, the Spaniards walked at a 60-minute mile pace, as if they had no care in the world or no destination to trek toward. It was no surprise they gave this American girl a widened side glance when I rushed (walked) past them and to my apartment.</p>\n                <p>I researched Barcelona before applying and arriving, of course, but nothing could have prepared me for the languid pace the Spaniards use throughout life, and not just when they\u2019re blocking the five-meter-wide sidewalks.</p>\n                <p>The days are longer, and meals take place later. The nights are more lively and last until the sun rises. The people in Barcelona enjoy their lives; they take the time to savor and live out each second, minute and hour.</p>\n                <p>Cafes will open from sunrise to sunset, filled with young scholars to old shopkeepers, staying for hours at a time doing work or reading a book with a cup of coffee and a side of a smoking cigarette.</p>\n                <p>Then from 2-5 p.m., it\u2019s like the city takes a nap, more formally known as a siesta, or what I call the best thing to ever exist. Locals close up their shops in the quiet neighborhoods, taking a moment to spend time with their family, nap, run errands or take a stroll through the park.</p>\n                <p>As a constantly busy and nervous wreck college student, the sudden change was like a soft embrace that lasted forever. My life was filled with constant rushing, leaving me with no time to breathe, but now I can truly take a pause and exhale.</p>\n                <p>Unlike at Penn State, where we pack our days with classes, quick meals, club activities and maybe a night out, I have endless hours to do all that I need. Never before in my college career have I taken the time to stroll around for an hour and sit at a cafe for another. My day has expanded, and I found myself quickly relaxing into this lifestyle that moves at a slower pace.</p>\n                <p>However, it\u2019s been less than two weeks since I arrived, and I can\u2019t help but occasionally rush through the slow crowds to my class, which I\u2019m already late for, or how twice already I found a rare restaurant open at 6 p.m. to have dinner and have a snack for \u201cdinnertime\u201d instead.</p>\n                <p>On another note, it\u2019s been less than two weeks, and I already find myself evolving and fitting into the Spanish lifestyle. My body grows tired at 3 p.m. and is more awake at 11 p.m.</p>\n                <p>I like exploring the city at a snail\u2019s pace, sitting at cafes, reading and getting ahead in my assignments. I like waking early to start the day and having a pause in the middle of it to recover. I love the nightlife that bustles until morning, then repeats all over again.</p>\n                <p>While I first hated waiting until the dead of night for a cheap taco shop to open, or taking a long nap before my 2:15 p.m. class after coming home from the clubs at 5 a.m. I now find myself easily falling into this bizarre and perfect routine.</p>\n                <p>MORE ABROAD COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>On Dec. 30, the No. 4 Nittany Lions closed out 2025 with a 1-0 victory over No. 12 Cornell at Pegula Ice Arena behind freshman Matilde Fantin\u2019s lone goal. It was a test of longevity and stamina \u2014 who could outlast the other \u2014 and the blue and white came out on top in the third period.</p>\n                <p>Since the calendars changed, Penn State saw diminished results. The Nittany Lions were swept by No. 2 Ohio State, fell in overtime to unranked Mercyhurst, and endured a scare to Syracuse on Saturday as well, winning 3-2.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white have the opportunity to put the mid-season blues to rest. Penn State and the Big Red are set to close out the second and last game they\u2019ll face each other this season at 6 p.m. on Tuesday at Lynah Rink in Ithaca, New York.</p>\n                <p>Ranked opponents</p>\n                <p>Cornell returns home to the Lynah Rink from New Haven, Connecticut, where the Big Red suffered a 3-1 loss to No. 13 Yale on Saturday afternoon. With a 12-7-2 overall record, the last time that Cornell defeated a ranked team was on Nov. 15, when Karel Prefontaine scored the golden goal in overtime to secure a 4-3 victory.</p>\n                <p>Since then, the Big Red have struggled against the tougher competition. On Jan. 9, Cornell was on pace to take down No. 11 Clarkson, holding a 5-3 lead late in the third period. However, the Golden Knights potted a pair of power-play goals to force overtime. Ultimately, the contest ended in a draw nationally, despite the Big Red winning in a shootout.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions had success in their ranked affairs prior to their run-in with the Buckeyes. On Oct. 17 and Oct. 18, Penn State swept then-No. 15 Mercyhurst on home ice. Then, over a month later, the Nittany Lions split a two-game series with No. 7 Northeastern in Boston.</p>\n                <p>Scouting the Big Red</p>\n                <p>When glancing at Cornell\u2019s roster, it\u2019s hard to overlook goaltender Annelies Bergmann. With a .930 save-percentage and a 1.91 goals-against average, the junior from Detroit has kept the Big Red competitive in nearly every game they\u2019ve played. Bergmann also sits tied for sixth in the nation with four shutouts on the season.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Regalado and Piper Grober present the largest defensive threat, putting in solid performances against the Nittany Lions in their previous meeting. Regalado leads the defense in blocked shots with 27 on the season, with Grober following closely behind with 26.</p>\n                <p>However, Cornell\u2019s biggest contributor on both ends of the ice is Avi Adam. The senior from Wolfville, Nova Scotia, leads the Big Red with 21 points and 29 blocked shots as a proper two-way forward.</p>\n                <p>Absences, current and upcoming</p>\n                <p>Penn State will be playing without Fantin for the foreseeable future, as the Como, Italy, native returned to her home country to prepare for the upcoming Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games with Team Italy.</p>\n                <p>Similarly, this week will be the last for Tessa Janecke and Nicole Hall, as well. Following the Nittany Lions\u2019 series against Delaware in Happy Valley, Janecke and Hall are going overseas to play for Team USA and Team Sweden, respectively.</p>\n                <p>Goaltender Katie DeSa has been sidelined for the past five games with an undisclosed injury, allowing freshman Maddy Campbell to step up as the temporary starter. DeSa is tied for first in the nation with seven shutouts and is currently one away from breaking Penn State\u2019s all-time shutout record.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>This past week, Penn State headlined the Big Ten wrestling slate with a dominant performance against the Iowa Hawkeyes. While that was Friday\u2019s primetime bout, the rest of the conference had a noteworthy week.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what happened in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Iowa makes roster change</p>\n                <p>Before diving into the results on the mat, the top story of the week dropped out of Iowa City last Tuesday. During his weekly media availability, Iowa coach Tom Brands told reporters that then No. 4 197-pound wrestler Massoma Endene was no longer with the program.</p>\n                <p>Endene had been out with an injury and stepped away from the team temporarily following the birth of his first child last week, prior to the announcement. Freshman Harvey Ludington took Endene\u2019s spot in the lineup against the Nittany Lions and is expected to keep the role moving forward.</p>\n                <p>Friday night lights</p>\n                <p>The second match of Big Ten Network\u2019s Friday night doubleheader was a bout between Nebraska and Minnesota, that saw nine matches decided via decision.</p>\n                <p>Despite scoring 21 points, Nebraska was credited with a 20-12 victory over the Golden Gophers after No. 4 heavyweight AJ Ferrari was assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct deduction for his celebration after defeating Koy Hopke in sudden victory.</p>\n                <p>Other noteworthy results from the dual include No. 10 Vance Vombaur\u2019s decision victory over Jake Hockaday at 141-pounds, No. 5 Antrell Taylor pinning No. 19 Charlie Millard at 157-pounds and No. 3 Max McEnelly needing a sudden victory period to outlast No. 9 Silas Allred at 184-pounds.</p>\n                <p>Elsewhere in the conference, Purdue took down Maryland 28-11 on the road despite missing two key contributors in Joey Blaze and Greyson Clark. The key victory came when No. 22 Ben Vanadia took out No. 15 Branson John via major decision at 197-pounds.</p>\n                <p>The evening also saw Michigan defeat Rutgers, Illinois defeat Michigan State and Wisconsin hand Northwestern their first loss of the season.</p>\n                <p>Sunday matinee slate</p>\n                <p>Three other Big Ten duals occurred on Sunday afternoon, which included Penn State sweeping Northwestern. The Nittany Lions\u2019 52-point margin of victory accounted for the conferences\u2019 largest of the season.</p>\n                <p>Maryland fell to 0-4 in the conference after a 26-12 loss to Penn State\u2019s other upcoming opponent, Indiana. Despite the team loss John bounced back in the highest-ranked match on the card, upsetting No. 14 Gabe Sollars, 4-3.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers stomped Purdue 24-9 in Piscataway, New Jersey, behind victories in four-ranked matches. With the dual starting at 197, Remy Cotton and heavyweight No. 20 Hunter Catka set the tone with back-to-back major decisions. Despite the loss, Purdue had some standout performances, including Ashton Jackson taking No. 27 Ayden Smith to sudden victory at 125 pounds and Brody Baumann shocking No. 10 Lenny Pinto at 174.</p>\n                <p>Finally, Michigan outlasted Illinois in the closest dual of the weekend, 18-14. The standout result from Ann Arbor was Illinois\u2019 184-pounder No. 32 Chris Moore scoring a decision over No. 8 Brock Mantanona.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING CONTENT</p>",

Penn State will finish the regular season 4-0 against Syracuse, outscoring the Orange 25-5 in the process.

Her 14th and 15th goals of the season sparked Penn State to its 20th and 21st wins of the season. Outwater has now scored first for Penn State in five games this season, the most on the team.</p>\n                <p>The Picton, Ontario, native has tallied 26 points so far this season, second on the team to Tessa Janecke</p>\n                <p>Butze stands alone</p>\n                <p>Defenseman Kendall Butze was one of five different skaters to put up multi-point games over the weekend, but her assist on Saturday set her performance apart from the rest.</p>\n                <p>Trailing 1-0, Outwater found the back of the net just over two minutes after Syracuse got on the board first. Butze and Mikah Keller were each credited with an assist. For Butze, it was her 15th of the season and the 66th of her career, a new Penn State hockey record for assists by a defenseman.</p>\n                <p>Entering this season, the senior trailed Lyndie Lobdell, 2024, and Izzy Heminger, 2023.

Saturday\u2019s contest was just the second this season in which the captain found the back of the net multiple times.

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>To call Penn State a dynasty would be an understatement.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have won 12 of the last 14 national championships, and have won four-straight national titles three different times.</p>\n                <p>In the NIL era, other teams have the opportunity to close the gap. Iowa and Oklahoma State are the two most storied programs across NCAA wrestling history. If given substantial funding, those programs are expected to take a jump and compete against the Nittany Lions. However, that has yet to happen, with Iowa most recently falling to Penn State 32-3.</p>\n                <p>The commanding win for the Nittany Lions over the Hawkeyes, one of the most historically dominant teams in the sport, showcases that Penn State is in a different lane than everyone else.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is coming off a season where it broke many records, including the points record in the NCAA championship and having all 10 wrestlers earn All-American status.</p>\n                <p>Iowa has seemingly dropped in competitiveness compared to Penn State. Whether that\u2019s because the Nittany Lions continue to improve or the Hawkeyes\u2019 wrestlers have dropped in talent level is yet to be determined.</p>\n                <p>The domination from Penn State on Friday raises concern for the state of the Iowa program. It has many people asking if the Hawkeyes have fallen off after one of the most lopsided duals in Iowa-Penn State history.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think that we have the right guys to do the job,\u201d Iowa coach Tom Brands said post match. \u201cThere is a gap between Iowa and Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That gap hasn\u2019t been close since Iowa\u2019s defeat of the Nittany Lions on Jan. 31, 2020, the last time Penn State lost a dual meet to any team.</p>\n                <p>On paper, Iowa has top wrestlers in their program, which included matches at 184 and 285 being weight classes the Hawkeyes could win.</p>\n                <p>Yet it didn\u2019t happen, as the Hawkeyes had No. 1 Angelo Ferrari lose to No. 4 Rocco Welsh. Welsh wrestled to his style, defeating him 2-1 in an intense, yet stall-heavy tiebreaker at 184. At heavyweight, No. 13 Cole Mirasola took down No. 5 Ben Kueter in a close battle, too.</p>\n                <p>Two of Iowa\u2019s top wrestlers failed to step up on the biggest stage of the regular season. It was something that was also notable at last year\u2019s NCAA Championships when its transfer portal additions in highly touted Jacori Teemer failed to place, or earn any points for the Hawkeyes.</p>\n                <p>Iowa has had 34 straight years with a national finalist, which could come to an end this season. And if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll likely come from Ferrari who\u2019s notoriously scored few points, leading to few points earned for the overall team score.</p>\n                <p>The Hawkeyes\u2019 major run came in the 1990s under legendary coaches Dan Gable and Jim Zalesky. Brands brought the team back to national championships with three straight titles from 2008-10.</p>\n                <p>The run may be coming to an end for Iowa as a perennial top-three team in the country, but Penn State has shown no signs of slowing down.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are a very young team with perspective. Levi Haines is the lone senior, with William Henckel in line to start next year. Henckel was a U20 World Silver Medalist, while Jayden James, a U17 World Champion could also be in the mix in that weight class when he arrives as a freshman next year.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a surplus of title contenders to choose from, and also has FloWrestling\u2019s No. 2 recruiting class in 2027 with No. 2 Landon Sidun and No. 6 Grey Burnett, as guys up next in the lighter weight classes.</p>\n                <p>While the train might be coming to a halt in Iowa City, the Penn State train continues to chug along, getting further away from what was once a formidable opponent.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Big Ten Recap | Men\u2019s basketball shakeups in standings imminent",
    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Big Ten basketball season swung into full tilt, as the conference teams approached the midpoints of their seasons.</p>\n                <p>The hierarchical order of teams starts to emerge at this point, and with it, schools are breaking and meeting expectations. This factor reinforces the need to reflect, especially on the Big Ten media poll at the start of the year, as some of its rankings seem laughable at the midseason.</p>\n                <p>The last week of play inside the conference only strengthens that narrative.</p>\n                <p>Boilermaker brilliance, Cornhusker continuation</p>\n                <p>In the preseason poll, there stood one team as a favorite above them all \u2014 Purdue. After this past week of play, the placement is justified. The Boilermakers squeaked out two close wins on the road over Iowa and USC, both middle-of-the-pack teams with strong home records, however.</p>\n                <p>Leading Purdue, as always, is a stout big man, this time in the form of Oscar Cluff, and he\u2019s posted efficient outings, such as a 19 point outing against USC, yet he\u2019s played second fiddle.</p>\n                <p>The leading story out of West Lafayette is Braden Smith, who, in his fourth year with Purdue, played his best basketball so far in his career, as he stands on pace to challenge Bobby Hurley\u2019s all-time career assists mark.</p>\n                <p>Against USC and Iowa, Smith led the Boilermakers in scoring, as the NCAA\u2019s best passer opted to lead with his jumper, yet also posted 13 assists over the two games.</p>\n                <p>The other team atop the conference, Nebraska, didn\u2019t get that initial buzz predicted as preseason predictions had it finishing in the bottom five of the conference. Over the past week of play, it defeated Oregon 90-55 and Northwestern 77-58, rising to 18-0. Evan Miyakawa ranks the Cornhuskers as the 12th-best team in the nation and tabs it as a hot team at the moment.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern, Penn State sink to the bottom</p>\n                <p>While those two teams skyrocketed to the top amid mixed expectations, a pair of teams sank like an anchor to the bottom of the Big Ten once conference play started.</p>\n                <p>The media picked Penn State to finish at the bottom of the conference, while it picked Northwestern just slightly below Nebraska at fourth from the bottom. Both big cat schools sit winless in the conference and have lost their last five games.</p>\n                <p>Both suffered 11 point losses to UCLA and No.11 Illinois on Jan. 14, respectively. Nebraska crushed the Wildcats, while Maryland destroyed Penn State; both squads had little to boast about this season, and last week embodied that sentiment perfectly.</p>\n                <p>The two teams face each other soon, on Jan 29, and it\u2019ll be a battle to avoid the bottom.</p>\n                <p>Middle of the pack moments</p>\n                <p>Between those top of the conference juggernauts and those Big Ten bottom dwellers, there remain 14 teams all vying to differentiate themselves from the pack, and after the past week of play, some squads attempted that.</p>\n                <p>Those attempts span both on and off the court. A team like Ohio State, which sits seventh, added a sixth-year former Nittany Lions forward, Puff Johnson, hoping to boost its squad midseason, although it triumphed over UCLA without him this past week, who stands one spot below the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>Indiana and Iowa occupy the next two spots below them in the standings and faced each other last week. Iowa pulled out a 17 point victory, which tied it with Indiana at 3-4 in the conference, although the Hawkeyes appear prepared to make a leapfrog.</p>\n                <p>The next week of play inside the Big Ten has the majority of the middle-of-the-pack teams scheduled to face each other; Minnesota faces Ohio State, Rutgers heads to Iowa City to face the Hawkeyes, and the rest of the top five conference teams, behind Purdue and Nebraska. Michigan State and Illinois are set to face lower-half conference teams in Maryland and Oregon.</p>\n                <p>The matchup to watch around the Big Ten this next week is Michigan against Indiana. Michigan routinely has been tested this season and Indiana has the quality to mount an upset, despite its crushing loss to the Hawkeyes in the past week.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "\u2018Dane is a Trojan\u2019 | Dane Dowiak exemplifies what it means to be captain at Penn State",
    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When Dane Dowiak speaks, his teammates listen.</p>\n                <p>The junior forward never shies away from speaking his mind. And he\u2019s sometimes brutally honest. But he can be, because he backs his words with an unmatched work ethic.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019s considered the strongest player on the team. He\u2019s unafraid to scrap for a loose puck along the boards or lay a booming hit to spark a comeback. He\u2019s willing to play any role asked of him with no complaints.</p>\n                <p>Bottom line: Dowiak is a team-first guy. It\u2019s why his teammates love him. It\u2019s why they respect him. And it\u2019s why they voted him the 12th captain in program history.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Dane) is very accountable to himself. He talks a big game, but he backs it up,\u201d Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky said. \u201cHe's an extremely strong, gritty guy. He loves Penn State and embodies it. Most importantly, he plays for the team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky lauded Dowiak\u2019s willingness to do \u201cthe little things\u201d that don\u2019t show up in the box score. Like getting pucks out of the defensive zone, winning face-offs, getting cross-checked as he pokes at a loose puck, and, as Gadowsky elegantly stated, \u201cgetting his ankles hacked.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dowiak\u2019s teammates recognize his unselfishness. They appreciate his authentic leadership style \u2014 one filled with both passion and compassion. They respect his ability to joke with them on the same day he airs them out for an embarrassing performance.</p>\n                <p>And they laud his willingness to never ask something of them he wouldn\u2019t do himself.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDane is a nails guy \u2014 a guy we all look to when things are tough,\u201d sophomore forward Braeden Ford said. \u201cWhen things are tough, you look for a guy to lead the way, you look for a guy to lead the charge, and Dane is the perfect guy to do that. He'll go through somebody on the wall. He'll go score a greasy goal. He's a guy that everybody looks to for some energy and to get us going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dowiak\u2019s leadership role has grown since his first collegiate season. But he\u2019s never needed a fancy title or a letter stitched on his jersey to motivate his teammates.</p>\n                <p>The Pittsburgh native didn\u2019t require a boost from his coaches to outwork everyone in the weight room as a freshman. He didn\u2019t complain when asked to play one game on the top scoring line and the next told to block shots and clear pucks on the penalty kill.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky said he always knew Dowiak embodied traits aligned with Penn State\u2019s captaincy. It\u2019s why the head coach entered the season with high expectations of his junior captain. And it\u2019s why he appeared unfazed to see his players accept Dowiak\u2019s leadership style.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe are seeing exactly what we saw from Dane the previous two (seasons), and I'm sure it\u2019s exactly why he got selected by his peers,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe does his job. He can play in every situation, and no matter what you ask of him, he never complains. He's never even hinted at wanting a different role. He'll do whatever is asked of him to the best of his ability.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Junior forward Reese Laubach is in his third season with Penn State. He\u2019s experienced various leadership styles, from the vocal leadership of captain Christian Berger to the quiet, measured leadership of last season\u2019s captain, Simon Mack.</p>\n                <p>But Dowiak brings something different. Because, as Luabach explained, Dowiak leads by example.</p>\n                <p>Picture this. Penn State just lost 7-1 on its home ice to then-No. 2 Michigan \u2014 a demoralizing defeat that marked the team\u2019s third consecutive loss. Its players were defeated and discouraged. Most importantly, they were embarrassed by their poor effort against a Big Ten rival.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions sat silent at their lockers, awaiting a possible message from Gadowsky. But their coach never showed. He knew his captain\u2019s words would hold more weight. He knew Dowiak would speak because his competitiveness wouldn\u2019t stand another effort like the one seen that Friday night inside Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>And, as Laubach said, when Dowiak spoke, everyone listened.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Dane\u2019s) words go a long way with how he plays and how he holds himself,\u201d freshman defenseman Nolan Collins said. \u201cHe plays hard for us. He blocks shots for us. He throws his body around. So it's easy to follow a guy like that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dowiak\u2019s words did hold weight. The junior forward assisted Laubach\u2019s game-winning goal as Penn State defeated Michigan 4-2 the next night.</p>\n                <p>It was an example of Dowiak\u2019s leadership style, one that rubbed off on his teammates to earn an upset win. And while that style resonated that night, his leadership extends beyond hustle plays and blocked shots.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore goaltender Kevin Reidler called Dowiak an \u201cawesome leader\u201d because of his positivity on and off the ice. Sophomore defenseman Nick Fascia said it\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d to play for someone like Dowiak, who himself does everything he asks of others.</p>\n                <p>Halfway through Dowiak\u2019s first season as captain, the Nittany Lions are rolling. They\u2019re 16-6 and ranked No. 8 in the latest USCHO poll.</p>\n                <p>There are many reasons for Penn State\u2019s hot start. The additions of top NHL draft prospects Gavin McKenna and 2025 first-round pick Jackson Smith have certainly helped. As has standout play from its goaltending tandem of Reidler and Josh Fleming.</p>\n                <p>But, as Dowiak\u2019s teammates would tell you, his leadership has topped everything.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDane is a Trojan. He's our captain,\u201d freshman forward Shea Van Olm said. \u201cWe look up to him, we want him to lead, and he knows, being in the position he's in, he's got to lead by example.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you\u2019re anything like me, growing up, your parents regaled you with stories from their college days, usually concerning their collegiate escapades, but with some cultural flair as well.</p>\n                <p>For example, my dad, a graduate of the University of Michigan (sigh), barring all of his Greek life adventures (he was a pledge master in the \u201880s \u2014 do with that what you will), most often told me about the \u201cM\u201d in the Diag quad.</p>\n                <p>If you stepped on this infamous letter, it was said you wouldn\u2019t pass your next exam unless you ran about a half mile to a nearby clock tower in ten seconds or less.</p>\n                <p>Though seemingly just a silly tradition, this 70-plus-year-old lore has stood the test of time, but if you mentioned the bronze \u201cM\u201d to anyone who hasn\u2019t gone to UMich or heard stories from someone who did, it would make no sense to them.</p>\n                <p>Just as we here at PSU use words and phrases like \u201cTHON,\u201d \u201cState Patty\u2019s,\u201d and \u201ctownies\u201d that would mean virtually nothing to the average Joe Schmoe around the block, every campus has its own unique culture.</p>\n                <p>We\u2019re connected here by much more than simple accidental proximity. We\u2019re connected by tradition, by culture, by vocabulary, and even by brands.</p>\n                <p>We all know that Crown Russe will put the fear of G-d into anyone who\u2019s ever tasted it before, but outside of PA, I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s even heard of it, let alone drank it. And every college has its own brand of disgusting and disgustingly cheap vodka used at every frat party.</p>\n                <p>We even have our own cultural rites of passage. Yes, everyone across America celebrates their 21st birthday as it symbolizes something special. But at Penn State, it would be a crime if you didn\u2019t celebrate it at The Phyrst with the green, plastic top hat and a shot of a more explicit nature.</p>\n                <p>Food is a similarly strong indicator of a unique cultural space. We all know that D.P. Dough is the greatest drunk food of all time, but would probably be revolting to consume in sobriety. Similarly, El Jefe\u2019s is best consumed after a night out. And The Tavern is a great spot for when your daddy\u2019s in town, footing the bill.</p>\n                <p>And although I\u2019m a bit of a luddite with a rather lackluster grasp on pop culture these days, even I know we have our very own campus celebrities. Before she graduated, Katie Feeney was a constant presence in the PSU football world, and her successor, Megan Million, is relatively well known in the Dunkin\u2019 and social media world.</p>\n                <p>I often think about, as a senior, what I\u2019ll remember after I graduate, and especially, what I\u2019ll remember well enough to tell my own children about.</p>\n                <p>I think about our singing \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d at every football game; about the Willard preacher in his classic red sweatshirt; about the daunting feeling of stepping into Thomas 100 or Forum 102 for the first time. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n                <p>None of these things are official, and none of them are school-sanctioned, but this is what we remember most about our experiences here.</p>\n                <p>Each and every university is its own micro-culture, its own small study of anthropology.</p>\n                <p>What will you remember?</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Alex Fischer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Students gathered in the HUB-Robeson Center Monday afternoon to celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s legacy with an annual Day of Service. Hosted by the Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration Student Committee, the theme for this year\u2019s MLK Day celebrations is \u201cUndaunted Hope.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The MLK Day of Service is part of a nationwide movement started in 1994 to turn a federal holiday \u2014 a day \u201coff\u201d \u2014 into a day of community service \u2014 a day \u201con.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The event began with breakfast, followed by a keynote speech from Smeal College of Business Associate Dean Jamie Campbell and a video about the life and legacy of King.</p>\n                <p>Attendees then dispersed into volunteer groups to work with non-profit organizations from Centre County, including Centre Safe, the Jana Marie Foundation, the Youth Service Bureau and the Institute for Promoting Health, Education, Art and Technology (iPHET).</p>\n                <p>Maya Mathes, a member of the MLK Commemoration Student Committee\u2019s planning committee, was thrilled to see about 600 people in Alumni Hall at the start of the day.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI just hope that people get a lot of fulfillment out of this,\u201d Mathes, a third-year studying food science, said. \u201c(Waking) up early in the morning, on a snowy day with 22 degree weather, no school \u2026 I\u2019m just happy that a lot of people just want to give back to our community.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mathes said her mom raised her to always give back to the community.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just always been a core part of who I am as a person,\u201d Mathes said. \u201cAnd I feel like just being able to give back to Centre County, where I\u2019ve been a resident for three years now, I feel like it\u2019s a really nice way for me to just show my appreciation to everybody around me.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Patrick Williams, the outreach director for the MLK Commemoration Committee, said his favorite part of the day was going from room to room, checking in with each volunteer group and seeing everyone talking to each other.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEverybody is just spreading love because that\u2019s what MLK wanted,\u201d Williams, a fourth-year studying telecommunications and media industries, said. \u201cYou get people from diverse backgrounds just spreading awareness, spreading love, everybody coming together.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ezekiel Hernandez spent the afternoon helping the Youth Services Bureau package diapers with members of his fraternity, Sigma Lambda Beta.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s been happening all across the United States and across the world,\u201d Hernandez, a third-year studying computational data science, said. \u201cI\u2019m Latino, (and) there\u2019s been a lot of different things with ICE, with Venezuela, just so many different things that are happening right now \u2026 but there\u2019s still a lot of people that are in need of help, and we just need to keep pushing forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Valeria Herrera attended the event with her roommate.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI actually transferred from a community college this semester, so this is all very new,\u201d Herrera, a third-year studying global and international studies, said. \u201cI wanted to get more involved on campus and just help out as much as I can.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Herrera worked on making \u201cJared Boxes\u201d for the Jared Box Project, which are plastic, shoe-sized boxes filled with gifts, games and toys which are given to children in hospitals all over the country.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s so much fun to just envision a little kid receiving a box, and then just lighting up (with) excitement,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI just want to make positive impacts in (these) little kids\u2019 lives, because they\u2019re just in hospitals all day, every day, and I feel like their days could definitely be really gloomy \u2026 I want to make them happy and make their childhood as normal as possible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kadyn Young was at the Day of Service with members of her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, making first-aid kids for iPHET.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWith everything going on in the world, we could all use a bit more love, we could all use a bit more unity,\u201d Young, a second-year studying finance, said. \u201cSo, I feel like that\u2019s a great way to honor him, (by) helping others and giving back to our community \u2026 (MLK Day) is not just a day off, it\u2019s a day of doing something to honor his legacy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Paris Stafford, co-director of the MLK Commemoration Committee, said it\u2019s important to not forget MLK\u2019s legacy.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo one wants to repeat history,\u201d Stafford, a third-year studying economics, said. \u201cSo really just, keeping all our generations, future generations informed of what MLK did.\u201d</p>\n                <p>King is also the reason Stafford went into economics, as King had written a book about the connection between systemic poverty and systemic racism.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe wanted everyone to be equitable and everyone to be equal,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cI really thought that was just phenomenal. And using that type of mindset, it really got me into economics and wanting to kind of close that generational wage gap.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As volunteers came back together in Alumni Hall at the end of the event, they were asked to sign a large \u201cMLK 2026\u201d poster on their way in. The prompt was: \u201cWhat hope do you want to create?\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cMLK has definitely been a big part of my life,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cAnd so, really, just seeing this opportunity to do service in my community is just phenomenal.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 Guard Kayden Mingo was on the court warming up ahead of Penn State\u2019s game against Maryland on Sunday. He was listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d before the game due to his nose injury.</p>\n                <p>Mingo then made his return to action by slotting back into the starting lineup and dropping 19 points, five assists, three rebounds and a steal despite a 96-73 loss to the Terrapins. He wore a face mask during the game and explained what it was like playing in his first game back.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI felt comfortable,\u201d Mingo said postgame. \u201cIt was an adjustment at first and practice and stuff, and now I feel good with it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo spoke to reporters during a press conference on Jan. 5, and there wasn\u2019t an indication he was dealing with any injuries at that moment. However, during a practice later that day, Mingo suffered a broken nose, which forced him to miss the Michigan game on Jan. 6, and he didn\u2019t even appear on the sideline for the matchup.</p>\n                <p>The freshman remained listed as \u201cout\u201d for the Purdue game on Jan. 10, but Mike Rhoades provided more clarity on the situation postgame, saying Mingo\u2019s surgery \u201cwent well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo stayed under the \u201cout\u201d section of the availability report for the UCLA game last week, but he made a public appearance and sat on the sideline for the contest.</p>\n                <p>Sunday marked the first time Mingo warmed up ahead of a matchup since suffering the injury, and he didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d be sidelined for a long time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI didn't think (my absence) would be too long,\u201d Mingo said. \u201cI know I'm around a lot of great people who can help me and get me back fast, so I didn't stress on it too much. I just wished my teammates good luck as they went into the next couple games.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo kicked off the game with a corner three, as Penn State grabbed an early lead. Through the first five minutes, Mingo had seven points on 100% shooting, keeping the Nittany Lions within range of Maryland\u2019s 16-13 advantage.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins began to run away with the game in the first half, leading 56-26 at halftime, but Mingo helped Penn State stay in the game. Coming out of the second half, the Nittany Lions cut the lead down to 10 points behind multiple plays by Mingo.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought his timing was off a little bit at times, but he battled, especially in the second half when we made that run,\u201d Rhoades said postgame. \u201cI thought he really got downhill, was pushing the ball, got us into stuff and all that. So our trainer did a great job with him, helping him get back. Doctors did a great job to get him back. You just got to get now, in the flow of it, and the feel of it, all that stuff. He was out for a while, but he's a hard rock and dude, he's a tough kid.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo averages 15.2 points, 3.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2.4 steals per game throughout 15 appearances this season. He shot 58.3% from the field and 40% from 3-point range against the Terrapins, improving his season shooting marks to 49.2% from the field and 25% from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>It was more than just a return for Mingo as he seemed his usual self at times throughout the game against Maryland. He credited Penn State\u2019s training staff for its efforts.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur trainer, Justin (Pomar), had a good plan in place,\u201d Mingo said. \u201cWe took it day by day, and every day was a step closer to getting back in the process. Give all thanks to Justin and everybody who helped me.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | Authentically inauthentic: Music\u2019s evolution away from sincerity",
    "author": "Emma Strickling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Much like anything, music has evolved and continues to evolve over time. While things like genre popularity have influenced its direction \u2014 the most influential factor is arguably technology.</p>\n                <p>Increased technological capabilities has allowed artists a greater ability to expand the way they create music. While technology is a helpful tool, I think it\u2019s led to less authenticity in music. For example, autotune, which made its way onto the music scene in 1997, has made music less unique and personal</p>\n                <p>Cher\u2019s \u201cBelieve,\u201d one of the more notable songs featuring autotune, used it as a pitch corrector. Its usage meant less time was spent in the studio rerecording vocals, saving the bigwigs of the label money. Today technology can do a myriad of things, such as shape one\u2019s voice manually . Furthermore, its broadened capabilities now make this a staple within the music industry today, with a large majority of artists using autotune on their records.</p>\n                <p>While some argue technology broadens the scope of musical ability, I believe it takes away the opportunity for an authentic sound \u2014 making each singer\u2019s voice a replication of others. All the distinct little quirks within a singer's voice are no longer present, leaving the vocals sounding soulless.</p>\n                <p>So what if the note is a little flat? I want to hear the little imperfections. I want to hear the humanity of natural singing and instrumentation, not something that sounds like it\u2019s coming from a computer.</p>\n                <p>One of my favorite artists is Bob Dylan, and occasionally, when I mention that to people, they normally comment on his singing voice. I know he\u2019s not the best singer ever to exist on this Earth.</p>\n                <p>However, the thing that sets Dylan apart from modern-day singers and one of the reasons I admire him is that he\u2019s not pretending to be some great singer. Even as an 84-year-old man, he\u2019s still performing, now with a gravelly and weathered voice. Some might argue it\u2019s worse than before, but he isn\u2019t covering it up.</p>\n                <p>Not only does excess technology rob music of an authentic sound, the lyrics suffer as well. If it seems like songs today are simpler and more repetitive, it\u2019s because they are. A study from the Scientific American magazine found over the past 50 years songs have adopted longer choruses which is part of the reason everything sounds the same.</p>\n                <p>In a lot of modern music it seems like the chorus takes up half the song, and in some cases it absolutely does.</p>\n                <p>Even songs today credit multiple people writing on them. Popular names like Benson Boone and Sabrina Carpenter have credited at least three people per song on their most recently released album. One would think that by having a variety of perspectives, there would be a greater possibility for more unique lyrics and less repetition. But alas that isn\u2019t the case.</p>\n                <p>Authenticity of voice is especially important for songwriting because it creates a connection between performer and listener. It\u2019s more compelling when you hear a song that comes from a place of true expression and feeling, whereas repetitive writing potentially leaves the listener uninspired and bored. Well, at least it does for me.</p>\n                <p>I think something that gets overlooked today is that songwriting is just as much a method of storytelling as any artistic medium. Take the song \u201cSuite: Judy Blue Eyes\u201d written by Stephen Stills and performed by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. It\u2019s divided up into four sections, true to its name as suite, with each section distinct from the others. Yes, there\u2019s a repeating theme in the first part with the chorus, but it\u2019s not like it occurs during the entire seven minutes of the song.</p>\n                <p>Through his songwriting, Stills reflects on a relationship that\u2019s on the verge of ending. Not only is there strong lyrical writing, but the inclusion of harmonies provided by bandmates David Crosby and Graham Nash really help to create a sound that\u2019s distinct and authentic to their group.</p>\n                <p>To make it clear, I\u2019m not trying to say that music needs to be complex in order to be considered great. Simple songs can be great, too, if they\u2019re done well. What I really mean is that creating music that\u2019s heavily repetitive and dependent upon technology takes away the potential of greatness.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps these artists of today should focus more on their own abilities and not what will be commercially acceptable. If technologies like autotune are a must to today\u2019s artists, then I think they might be in the wrong business.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "title": "Penn State women\u2019s basketball lacks 4th quarter toughness in loss to Rutgers",
    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Against Illinois on Jan. 11, toughness was the key talking point for coach Carolyn Kieger as Penn State fell to 7-11 on the year.</p>\n                <p>Things were no different on Sunday as the Lady Lions fell to Rutgers, marking their eighth-straight loss and continuation of a winless conference record.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt comes down to toughness again,\u201d Kieger said following the Rutgers game. \u201cWe did a great job taking care of the ball tonight, but it still goes back to being tough and finishing the possession.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For a majority of the first three quarters, that toughness was visible as the blue and white were up by three points entering the final period.</p>\n                <p>Despite not being the team\u2019s leading scorer, 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle was a key contributor to that toughness against the Scarlet Knights, constantly being double-teamed down in the paint.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m kind of used to (being double-teamed),\u201d Merkle said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m getting double-teamed, triple-teamed all game, every game. We go to practice, we work on it, and at the end of the day, I just got to go up stronger.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Merkle put up 21 points on Sunday as she went 7-for-11 from the field. However, her strength was most evident with her 10 free throw attempts. While she only made seven of them, her strength was on display as she got to the line five times.</p>\n                <p>On the same side of the ball, freshman Nyla McFadden also exhibited the Lady Lion tenacity in her third career start.</p>\n                <p>While McFadden scored nine points on 4-for-4 shooting, her main takeaway from the game wasn\u2019t her starting spot or perfect shooting, but rather the team\u2019s poor fourth-quarter defense that led to Sunday\u2019s loss.</p>\n                <p>\u201cReally, we just need to be tougher on the defensive end,\u201d McFadden said. \u201cWe just need to when it comes to in-the-game situations if we want to win a big game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Entering the final quarter up three points, the Lady Lions fell to the hands of a 9-2 run from Rutgers, who quickly retook the lead.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Scarlet Knights having just three offensive boards in the first three quarters, they tallied eight in the final period, which proved to be the game-changer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just something that can\u2019t happen,\u201d McFadden said.</p>\n                <p>While Kiyomi McMiller led the team in points, her presence was limited in the early parts of the fourth quarter after picking up her fourth foul with over nine minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>McMiller ultimately returned later in the quarter to finish the day with 27 points. However, hers and Merkle\u2019s performances couldn\u2019t overcome Rutgers\u2019 fourth-quarter advantage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSo until we develop this toughness and this grit to play defense, the results are not gonna change,\u201d Kieger said on Jan. 11 after the Illinois game.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A few weeks after Rutgers star freshman Kiyomi McMiller made the news after being benched due to internal matters, she entered the transfer portal and ultimately committed to Penn State in April.</p>\n                <p>On Sunday, she had a chance to face her former team for the first game, putting on a dominant performance on both sides of the ball despite the Lady Lions falling to 0-8 in conference play.</p>\n                <p>McMiller kept the blue and white alive late in the fourth quarter, tallying nine of the team\u2019s 17 points. However, hers and Gracie Merkle\u2019s efforts alone weren\u2019t enough for the win.</p>\n                <p>The Silver Springs, Maryland, native was silent for the first four minutes of action, but quickly came alive and stayed alive for the rest of the game. McMiller kick-started her game off with her first of many rebounds in the game and took it down the court, weaving back-and-forth through traffic as she stopped for a quick jumpshot.</p>\n                <p>As Rutgers began working the ball back down the court, ultimately missing the basket, the former Scarlet Knight earned her second rebound of the day, and after some back-and-forth ball movement, scored again with a layup.</p>\n                <p>McMiller\u2019s success didn\u2019t just come from her own shots, however. Down by seven points, McMiller found 6-foot-6 Merkle in the paint and dished the ball to her between tight double coverage.</p>\n                <p>After a few baskets from each team, McMiller followed up a four-point play from Viktoria Ranisavljevic with a triple of her own. That toughness continued midway through the second quarter as McMiller fought in the paint for a layup and earned a free throw, putting herself at double-digit scoring on the day.</p>\n                <p>Despite being a huge offensive and defensive asset to the Lady Lions, McMiller had a big impact on the court even when she didn\u2019t have the ball in her hands or guard the ball.</p>\n                <p>Less than one minute into the second half, Merkle and Nyla McFadden made a pair of baskets, giving Penn State its first lead of the game. As McFadden\u2019s shot hit the net, McMiller started clapping her hands and screaming in celebration as she stared over at Coquese Washington, her former coach.</p>\n                <p>Two drives following McMiller\u2019s celebration, the Lady Lions made arguably one of their biggest plays of the game. Freshman T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante picked off the inbound from Rutgers\u2019 Lauryn Swann and passed the ball to Moriah Murray, who crossed over a pair of Rutgers players and found McMiller wide open for a layup.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ultimately lost its lead late in the fourth quarter as the Scarlet Knights got hot, but McMiller was the key difference-maker who kept things close.</p>\n                <p>With just over a minute and a half left in regulation, McMiller drained her second triple of the day to end Rutgers\u2019 8-1 run.</p>\n                <p>Over the next two drives, McMiller made a pair of layups to ultimately cut the lead down to three points, but her efforts weren\u2019t enough for the Lady Lions.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2013 Penn State basketball went to face the Terrapins with the expectation that the Nittany Lions would fight and potentially earn their first Big Ten win against one of the other three teams that were winless in the conference. Yet, the only fight shown stood too little, too late.</p>\n                <p>Maryland endured a tumultuous season to this point, similar to Penn State, and this clash seemed like the season's pinnacle of that trend, as both staggered into the contest at less than full strength.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad entered with two questionable players, its leading scorers Kayden Mingo and Freddie Dilione V, while it listed big man Tibor Mirti\u0107 as out. Both questionable players suited up, with mixed results: Mingo played his usual over 30 minutes, while Dilione\u2019s ankle injury limited him to only 15.</p>\n                <p>Those injury woes didn\u2019t appear early for one squad, as a Maryland unit with three players sidelined cruised to its highest scoring first half in program history, en route to an eventual 96-73 rout.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMaryland came out and just absolutely smacked us in the first 20 minutes,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWith the group we have, the young team we have, we\u2019ve had some tough spells this year of just letting guys get off and get going, and Diggy (Coit) did that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Maryland guard Diggy Coit enacted the onslaught by the Terrapins, to Penn State\u2019s ire, as he flirted with a new program single-game scoring record, ultimately finishing a point shy. The Columbus, New Jersey, native notched 43 points on the day, obviously a career high, behind nine three-pointers, which consistently came off slick handles.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought (Diggy Coit) was going to score 100 points today,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cOur guys are fighting, you saw the second half, I thought the first eight to ten minutes of the second half, our guys battled.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That second-half run that Rhoades references is the only bright spot on a day on which the Nittany Lions fully surrendered to Coit and Maryland. The Nittany Lions came out on a 25-5 run over the first ten minutes of the second half, which pulled them within ten.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis stinks, this sucks, I hate it \u2013 we all hate it,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cNobody is giving us a freebie, this is life in the Big Ten, this is how it is nowadays in this crazy landscape of college athletics when you're trying to build a program \u2026 I\u2019ve done it at other places, some places it may take longer than ever.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That sentiment remains bitter in the mouths of Penn State basketball fans: a program that wants to win, every moment it gets to boost morale immediately gets countered by a blowout loss.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades and Penn State played many different lineups throughout the game, including a new small-ball lineup after Ivan Juri\u0107 picked up foul trouble in the second half. It signals where this team is at: still molding, figuring itself out, and creating its new identity. But Rhoades reflected on that lineup change and how his coaching came into play.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn our league, it\u2019s really hard to do that,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think we were getting enough from the other guys.

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 Mike Rhoades had a defeated look on his face as he sat down in the Xfinity Center media room after Penn State\u2019s 96-73 loss to Maryland on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>The result dropped the Nittany Lions to 9-9 on the year, bringing into question if Rhoades can build a basketball program at Penn State. He gave a blunt answer when asked about the current state of the team, saying \u201cthis stinks\u201d and \u201cwe all hate it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf there's any hits to take, I'll take the hits,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIf there's any pointing fingers, point them at me. Don't point them at the guys. They're working their butts off, and they're there. They want to win. They want to get after it. So it is what it is. You got to continue to move forward \u2026 So there's never going to be a day that, if I'm in charge of the program, that we're not going to try to get these guys better and push each other, telling each other the truth, and have each other's back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have seen close losses in conference play throughout this season, such as a 74-72 defeat to No. 2 Michigan or a 76-72 loss to No. 9 Michigan State. But the bottom line is Penn State is winless in Big Ten play, and there\u2019s been games where the team didn\u2019t show much, like Sunday\u2019s game or the 113-72 loss to Indiana.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has 13 games left in the season to pick up its first win in conference play. Despite being 0-7 in Big Ten play, there\u2019s a belief within the program in Rhoades and the Nittany Lions\u2019 chances to rattle off some victories.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThings happen,\u201d guard Kayden Mingo said. \u201cIt\u2019s basketball. There\u2019s two sides to it. You might win some, you\u2019re gonna lose some. And the same way we\u2019re going on a losing streak, I feel like we could turn it around and go on a winning streak, so I got confidence in my teammates and my coaches.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades is in Year 3 of his head coaching tenure at Penn State. While the Nittany Lions finished 16-17 in Rhoades\u2019 first season and 16-15 last year, there were flashes of what Rhoades could build.</p>\n                <p>Notably, Penn State knocked off No. 8 Purdue and No. 12 Wisconsin during the 2024-25 season. Rhoades came to the Nittany Lions after guiding VCU to multiple NCAA Tournament appearances.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI've done it in other places,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSome places may take a little bit longer than others, but get the right kids on board, hold them accountable to a high level, and especially when it's times like this, love them. Coach them hard. Love them harder.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a Big Ten Freshman of the Year contender in Kayden Mingo, among other young players who have flashed talent at times. Furthermore, the Nittany Lions are a finalist for 5-star 2026 guard Dylan Mingo, who plans to announce his college decision Thursday and would help in Rhoades\u2019 efforts in building a program in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Regardless, the Nittany Lions are still 41-41 overall and 15-32 in Big Ten play under Rhoades. Close losses have plagued Penn State, but blowout losses like Sunday won\u2019t help its outlook with Rhoades at the helm.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe've had pockets of good basketball. We've been close in some games,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cYou saw how we played those first eight minutes. We're just not mature enough and tough enough and mentally tough enough, and it starts with me. I got to keep helping these guys to find a way to get over the hump. But there's no excuses. We're not playing good enough basketball to win in the Big Ten, especially on the road.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State entered Sunday against Northwestern coming off a massive 32-3 win on the road against No. 2 Iowa. The Nittany Lions ended their weekend on the same side of the win column and extended their historic consecutive win streak in matches.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took home the victory by a score of 51-0.</p>\n                <p>174 Pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs No. 32 Eddie Enright (NU)</p>\n                <p>The match started at 174 with Levi Haines after he dominated Gabe Arnold against Iowa. The senior continued that momentum in this match against Eddie Enright.</p>\n                <p>Haines recorded the only points in the opening period to grab the 3-0 lead. Haines added two more takedowns in the second period and started to tire out Enright.</p>\n                <p>Haines continued to maintain control on the mat, extending his lead to 16-4, only allowing Enright to gain points by escaping. Haines got the tech fall-victory, 19-4.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 5-0.</p>\n                <p>184 Pounds: No. 4 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs JD Perez (NU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh started on the attack with a takedown in the opening 30 seconds of the match. Welsh continued to build off his momentum after defeating No. 1 Angelo Ferrari against Iowa, as the Ohio State transfer ended the first period on top, 12-5.</p>\n                <p>JD Perez secured the Wildcats first takedown of the match, but Welsh went right to work after, garnering two more takedowns in the second period.</p>\n                <p>Welsh got the tech fall 22-7 and extended Penn State\u2019s lead 10-0.</p>\n                <p>197 Pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs Alex Smith (NU)</p>\n                <p>Since coming back from injury Josh Barr has been on a tear, going undefeated so far this season.</p>\n                <p>Barr was in control for the entire match and pinned Alex Smith with 1:10 left in the first period.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 16-0.</p>\n                <p>285 Pounds: No. 13 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs Gabe Christenson (NU)</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola opened the match with a takedown in the opening 10 seconds and continued to get several takedowns in the first period.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt freshman looked quicker than Gabe Christenson and used that to his advantage.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola got the tech fall with 19 seconds left in the first period 19-4 and extended the lead to 21-0.</p>\n                <p>125 Pounds: No. 2 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs No. 26 Dedrick Navarro (NU)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl and Dedrick Navarro wrestled pretty evenly in the first period with Lilledahl ahead 3-1, but in the second period Lilledahl started to pull away.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl garnered two more takedowns in the middle period to extend his lead to 9-3. Lilledahl was the quicker wrestler and continued to maintain control of the match as it went on.</p>\n                <p>The St. Charles, Missouri, native secured the takedown late with a 20-6 victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 26-0.</p>\n                <p>133 Pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs No. 24 Sean Spidle (NU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze was the only wrestler to secure a takedown, but neither wrestler was able to do much. Sean Spidle displayed solid defense against Blaze and kept it close, 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Blaze earned the only points of the second period, yet Spidle had the biggest chance to earn a takedown. Spidle had Blaze\u2019s leg, but was never able to get the freshman to the ground.</p>\n                <p>Blaze started to take control in the third period with three takedowns to get the major decision, 15-4.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 30-0.</p>\n                <p>141 Pounds: No. 7 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs No. 32 Billy Dekraker (NU)</p>\n                <p>The match started pretty evenly until there was 20 seconds left in the opening period. Braeden Davis got a takedown and four near falls.</p>\n                <p>Billy Dekraker couldn\u2019t find a way to get any points on the board, despite having a few opportunities.</p>\n                <p>Davis got the major decision, 9-0. Penn State leads 34-0.</p>\n                <p>149: Pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs August Hibler (NU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness seemed comfortable the entire match against August Hibler. The junior secured two takedowns and seemed to be on top the entire first period.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness garnered two more takedowns and four near fall points in the middle frame. Van Ness secured the riding time right as the third period began.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 39-0</p>\n                <p>157 Pounds: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs Gunner Myers (NU)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke started the match with a takedown and never took his foot off the pedal. After review, Duke got the takedown erased as he never separated from Gunner Myers.</p>\n                <p>The freshman then secured the pin with 18 seconds left in the first period.</p>\n                <p>165 Pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs Nobody</p>\n                <p>Northwestern forfeited this match.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wins 51-0.</p>",

The matchup guaranteed someone their first Big Ten win.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions failed to earn their first Big Ten win, falling 76-72.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to fight and figure out a way to get this team confident and finish out a fourth quarter,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s Gracie Merkle took on Rutgers\u2019 Imani Lester for the opening tip that found T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante to give the Lady Lions first possession.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights got off to a quick start, shooting 4-for-6 from field-goal range to take an early 10-5 lead. However, Merkle got Penn State two points from the foul line, and Kiyomi McMiller nailed back-to-back buckets from inside the paint to give the Lady Lions their first lead of the game against her former team.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers didn\u2019t back down, as the Scarlet Knights went on an 8-0 run to take an 18-11 lead with just under four minutes to play in the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>Both teams kept trading baskets through the final minutes, but Rutgers had the upper hand to end the frame with a 22-17 lead.</p>\n                <p>About a minute in the second quarter, Moriah Murray got the scoring started with a foul-line jumper. It was quickly matched with a layup from Lester on the other end.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers exploded for a 7-0 run to take a 10-point lead with just under seven minutes left in the quarter, but Viktoria Ranisavlijevic picked the Lady Lions up with a four-point play.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wouldn\u2019t let up as a three-pointer from McMiller and a layup from Vit\u00f3ria Santana cut the Scarlet Knights\u2019 lead to 31-28.</p>\n                <p>Down by five, McMiller went at three Rutgers players inside the paint and completed the and-1 to make it a two-point game.</p>\n                <p>Both teams went cold for two minutes, but Santana stripped the ball from Faith Blackstone and was fouled after the play. The senior guard went to the line for two with a chance to tie the game, but missed the first.</p>\n                <p>The foul-shooting woes continued for the Lady Lions as Ranisavlijevic went 1-for-2 from the line to put the blue and white at 6-for-10 on the day and give the Scarlet Knights a 35-33 lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe shot better from the floor, but not the free-throw line and not the three,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI thought that was the big difference today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rutgers had a shot at the buzzer to extend its lead, but Kennedy Brandt\u2019s three-point attempt circled the rim and fell out.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened up the second half, scoring four-straight points to take its first lead since the opening quarter and cause a Rutgers timeout.</p>\n                <p>The timeout didn\u2019t slow the Lady Lions down as two defensive plays from Cl\u00e8ante led to four points on the offensive end.</p>\n                <p>Tied at 45 with five minutes to go in the frame, McMiller found McFadden on a cut to the basket to give the freshman her sixth points of the quarter. Penn State didn\u2019t hold the lead for long as Brandt nailed a three on the other end.</p>\n                <p>Merkle went 1-for-2 from the foul line on the other end to make it a tie contest once again.</p>\n                <p>Penn State held a 52-50 lead with just over a minute to play in the quarter, Merkle fouled Lester to give the Scarlet Knights a chance to even the score. Lester missed both, and a rebound by McMiller found its way to Murray for a three-pointer on the other end.</p>\n                <p>Swann made a jumper in the final seconds for Rutgers, but the Lady Lions held a 55-52 lead heading into the final frame.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights started with the ball, and a quick foul by Maggie Mendelson sent Blackstone to the line, where she made both.</p>\n                <p>After a layup from Merkle, Rutgers scored four-straight points to gain a one-point lead, forcing a Penn State timeout.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights continued a 7-0 scoring run to take a 61-57 lead, but were finally slowed down by consecutive two-pointers from McMiller and Merkle.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe had only given up three offensive rebounds going into the fourth and they ended up with 11,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cSo it comes back down to toughness. We did a great job of taking care of the ball, but it goes back to being tough and finishing the possession.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Both teams traded baskets over the next three minutes. With Rutgers holding onto a 66-64 lead, its leading scorer, Nene Ndiaye, recorded an and-one to make it a five-point game.</p>\n                <p>After a free throw from Merkle and back-to-back layups from Lester, Rutgers held a 73-65 lead with just over two minutes left to play.</p>\n                <p>With about 34 seconds left, the Scarlet Knights led 75-70 and had possession under their own basket. Following a shot-clock violation, the Lady Lions had 25 seconds to score two baskets.</p>\n                <p>McMiller drove to the basket for two points and only five seconds ticked off the clock. Coming out of a timeout, Shaelyn Steele fouled Ivey before Rutgers could inbound the ball. Ivey missed the first and made the second, making the score 76-72 with 20.7 seconds left.</p>\n                <p>Murray and Cl\u00e8ante both got three-point looks for the Lady Lions, but it wasn\u2019t enough as time ticked away.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Amiya Evans was listed as out for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions will start their West Coast trip with a contest against Washington at 9 p.m. Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 After losing four-in-a-row, Penn State ventured south to Maryland to take on the Terrapins on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>When it rains, though, it pours. The Nittany Lions remain winless in conference play after suffering an embarrassing 96-73 loss to Maryland.</p>\n                <p>To kick things off at the XFINITY Center, Ivan Juri\u0107 won the opening tipoff, which led to a Kayden Mingo three-pointer. Despite sporting a mask around his eyes and nose, Mingo\u2019s vision didn\u2019t look restricted at all in the early running.</p>\n                <p>David \u201cDiggy\u201d Coit, coming off a 30 point performance against USC, was up to 11 points within the first four minutes of the game after knocking down two three-pointers that pushed Maryland ahead to a 16-13 lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen good players get going early in the game, they have career nights,\u201d Mike Rhoades said about Coit. \u201cWe let him get going early. Good players, they get going early, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Another look from downtown, this time from Freddie Dilione V, tightened the gap for Penn State as it cut the deficit to 21-18 with 13 minutes left in the first half.</p>\n                <p>The long-ball had been the story of the game, still in the early stages, as Maryland\u2019s Elijah Saunders knocked one down to make it an eight-point game. It was his second of the day, while Coit was 3-3 from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins seized a 33-21 lead on a Darius Adams drive that forced the blue and white to use a timeout in an effort to regroup after facing its first substantial deficit.</p>\n                <p>It was all Maryland with just five minutes to play in the first half when the Terrapins extended their lead to 18 points after yet another three-pointer, this time from Isaiah Watts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State had no answer to the volume shooting, as it was draining just 25% of its three-pointers while the Terrapins were knocking down 67%.</p>\n                <p>With the game slowly slipping away from them, a visibly frustrated Mike Rhoades and the Nittany Lions took to the locker room at halftime, facing a hefty 56-26 disadvantage \u2013 The most points Maryland has ever scored in the first half of a Big Ten game.</p>\n                <p>Coit put up 30 points against the Trojans his last time out, but reached that mark in the first half alone after going 6-8 from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened up the scoring in the second half, though, with a Dominick Stewart three-pointer that was really just for pride at that point, as the Terrapins immediately responded.</p>\n                <p>At the first media timeout of the second half, around the 16-minute mark, Maryland was out-rebounding Penn State 27-13, with Mingo leading the blue and white with three boards.</p>\n                <p>A Josh Reed steal and score cut the lead to 60-46, but there wasn\u2019t a ton of belief in the XFINITY Center that his basket would turn it around for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe knew that we were going to go on a run, and that\u2019s what we did,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe tried to maintain it, but stuff happens; they made shots. But, coming out the second half with a lot of energy, we know that\u2019s how we have to play from here on out.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Another Stewart triple gave him 13 points on the day and made it a 12 point game, but there was a lot more work to do with just over 11 minutes left to play.</p>\n                <p>After being down 30 points at the half, the Nittany Lions worked it back down to just a 10 point game, only for the Terrapins to silence them and grab a 19 point lead thanks to scoring efforts from Saunders and Solomon Washington.</p>\n                <p>The two teams traded scores the next few possessions, with Eli Rice hitting a three-pointer of his own and Coit notching his 35th point of the game as Maryland went up 79-58.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHey, you suck\u201d chants rang out from inside the XFINITY Center after the Terrapins pushed their lead to 25 points with just about four minutes remaining, thanks to another Coit three-pointer, which gave him 43 on the day \u2013 a new career-high.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some tough spells this year of just letting some guys get off and get going, and David did that,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI thought he was going to score 100 points today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Some more scoring came here and there, but Maryland mostly played keep-away as time drained down and captured a 96-73 victory.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s standout freshman Kayden Mingo was listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d while recovering from a broken nose. However, Mingo was back in the starting lineup, but with a mask around his eyes and nose.</p>\n                <p>Freddie Dilione V was also listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d with an ankle injury, but played, though less than usual.</p>\n                <p>Tibor Mirti\u010d was again sidelined with a knee injury. Mirti\u010d will \u201cbe out for a little bit\u201d as his knee is \u201cjust rehabbing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions look to snap their five-game losing streak when they host Wisconsin on Thursday for the annual \u201cReturn to Rec\u201d game inside Penn State\u2019s historic Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>Scheduled tipoff is set for 7 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>On Friday and Saturday, the Penn State College Republicans hosted its third annual Pennsylvania Collegiate Leadership Conference in the HUB-Robeson Center.</p>\n                <p>Throughout the conference, the Penn State College Republicans offered a variety of speakers, including elected officials, Turning Point USA members, students and other political activists, part of efforts to introduce conservative principles throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Hunter Steach, the Penn State College Republicans\u2019 vice president, said the goals of the conference were civic engagement and creating a safe place for those with conservative and liberal ideologies alike to attend.</p>\n                <p>Steach said he wanted to allow attendees to meet with speakers, such as Glenn Thompson and Stacy Garrity, to gain insight into conservative perspectives.</p>\n                <p>Mia Humphreys, the Penn State College Republicans\u2019 director of special events, said the event offered community building for conservatives to portray their ideas, goals and values.</p>\n                <p>In Glenn Thompson\u2019s speech, he said principles and values define each person. He offered insight into his values as a Congressman by offering advice to potential future political leaders.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAlways try to listen twice as much as you speak \u2014 that's a true leader,\u201d Thompson said.</p>\n                <p>Brooke Phillips, a former member of the Penn State College Republicans, said that by listening and working together, real understanding and progress can happen.</p>\n                <p>\u201cConservative principles support open discussion and civil discourse,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t avoid these difficult conversations.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Throughout the conference, the Penn State College Republicans and their speakers presented conservative perspectives on various political topics. Ideas on how to combat issues \u2014 such as defending the republic by exploring ways to counter immigration flaws and a debate over U.S. policy regarding Venezuela to gain attendees' perspectives \u2014 were also presented.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEach side should be given the opportunity to express their views calmly, without attacking, while seeking common ground and shared goals,\u201d Phillips said.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Phillips, a Penn State alumna, said she values learning from other people and believes disagreement doesn\u2019t have to prevent cooperation.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people in my time here, from [a range] of political ideologies that feel afraid to share their beliefs,\u201d Steach, a fourth-year studying political science, said. \u201cThis conference enables people who have a dream in politics or not politics, and something in this realm, [to] chase them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Humphreys said the topics were intended to rally people together and enhance perspectives by standing up for beliefs and allowing attendees to speak their truth.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to continue free speech and free narrative on college campuses today,\u201d Humphreys, a second-year studying political science, said.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ranked 228 in a College Pulse Free Speech ranking in 2024 and again in 2025. The ranking detailed students\u2019 comfort expressing their ideas, as well as their tolerance for liberal and conservative speakers.</p>\n                <p>Despite the ranking, Penn State is considered to have a balanced ratio among conservative and liberal students.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe climate here is great,\u201d Humphreys said. \u201cWe have a great relationship with the College Dems. We work together. We do our 9/11 event together. Overall, Penn State does a better job of allowing all of us to have a voice compared to other college stories we may have heard of.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Steach said he always felt safe and respected at Penn State regarding his political beliefs and affiliation.</p>\n                <p>The growth of the College Republicans has gone from roughly three chapters to twenty-plus chapters connecting over the past three years, according to Steach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of college students sometimes aren\u2019t politically engaged at all,\u201d Humphreys said. \u201cThey don\u2019t go to the polls and vote, and that\u2019s ultimately what\u2019s most important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said the conference was meant to spread the word regarding conservative thought and get attendees involved to become more politically active.</p>\n                <p>Steach said he wanted people to feel more confident and comfortable sharing their beliefs after attending the conference.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe are a diverse community here at Penn State,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cExposure to differing perspectives allows students to form their own opinions and develop skills to engage respectfully.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

He wants to get everybody involved, and he would much rather set up a teammate for a goal and get one himself, but it was nice to see him get a little hungry to shoot the puck.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The freshman duo, which earned the first and second stars of the game, contributed to Penn State\u2019s final goal \u2014 an empty-net tally scored by captain Dane Dowiak. It marked a fitting end to a game dominated by two stars who had endured and overcome difficult adjustments to Division I hockey.</p>\n                <p>And for Smith, who tallied a career-best three points and finished as a plus-two, it signaled a newfound comfort level in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Smith) looks comfortable, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Gadowsky said with a smile. \u201cHe is just an absolute thoroughbred the way he skates, the way he handles the puck, the way he sees, the way he shoots. Every single weekend, he gets a little more comfortable. I think he's just playing awesome hockey.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Heritage Hall came alive with music and dance Saturday evening as the African Students Association (ASA) held its 13th annual Mr. and Miss Africa pageant in the HUB-Robeson Center.</p>\n                <p>The pageant, themed \u201cCrowned in Heritage,\u201d saw five contestants \u201cembody the beauty, strength and elegance\u201d of their respective countries. Each contestant integrated elements of their culture within their entrance into Heritage Hall and during events later into the night that were observed by a panel of four judges.</p>\n                <p>The contestants also presented an issue within their country they felt a personal connection to, as well as causes currently working to solve them.</p>\n                <p>Mercy Adetoyese, ASA\u2019s president, said she has helped set up the pageant since her freshman year and thought of the event as a way to display African culture in University Park.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis pageant is a way for people to showcase their culture, their identity, to the rest of Penn State and, honestly, it takes a lot of guts and bravery to even be up here, so going from being a shy and timid person to being able to get up on that stage is something I also truly admire,\u201d Adetoyese, a fourth-year studying biobehavioral health, said.</p>\n                <p>She said the pageant served as a way to show Penn State students, especially those within minority groups, that there is a supportive community for them on campus.</p>\n                <p>The pageant kicked off at 5:55 p.m. as contestants were met with applause from attendees as they entered Heritage Hall.</p>\n                <p>Rasha Elwakil, who competed as Miss Egypt to spread awareness about disability-related stigmas, said she saw the pageant as a way to step out of her comfort zone while showcasing Egyptian culture.</p>\n                <p>She said she hoped attendees left the pageant having learned about the importance of everyone\u2019s causes, as well as the diversity of Africa.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAll of our countries, we've learned, either have some similarities that are really, really cool; they also all have a lot of differences that make all of our cultures unique,\u201d Elwakil, a fourth-year studying geography, said. \u201cI want them to learn more about all of us as contestants and who we are. I think we really showcase our personalities throughout this entire experience and so that's going to be really cool to showcase throughout the night and have people learn more about who we are, as well as our causes.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Contestant Khamaal Akinwande, who competed as Mr. Nigeria and advocated for increased prostate cancer resources, said he hoped attendees would see ASA as more than just another student organization on campus.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI hope they leave here with an interest in not just my culture, but all of the contestants' culture,\u201d Akinwande, a first-year studying cybersecurity, said. \u201cI hope they understand that ASA is a place where we don't just come to talk about classes or the workload or how our week is going. We come to truly engage with others, learn about our cultures and how we can cultivate those cultures to build a stronger bond between each other.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The pageant concluded at 10 p.m. following the crowning of Ader Deng, a first-year studying cybersecurity who advocated for increased educational resources as the pageant\u2019s first Mr. South Sudan, and Zara Amos, a first-year studying political science who advocated for ending period poverty as Miss Ghana, as Mr. and Miss Africa.</p>\n                <p>They were crowned by Wisdom Moses, ASA\u2019s public relations chair and 2025 Mr. Africa winner.</p>\n                <p>Ian Mwaura, who travelled to University Park from Williamsport to attend the pageant, said he believed Deng\u2019s and Amos\u2019s victories were well deserved based on what he saw during events, such as the talent show, and the causes they presented.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMr. South Sudan, he did his thing, his talent definitely stood out, his principles and what he stands for also stuck out and the same thing with Miss Ghana,\u201d Mwaura, a third-year studying heating, ventilation and air conditioning engineering technology at the Pennsylvania College of Technology, said. \u201cEverybody talks about the problems that go on in the world but to actually make an organization at such a young age, to tackle them and get your hands dirty and do something about it, that's very commendable.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After taking a 4-1 victory over Notre Dame in a physical, special-teams battle Friday night, No. 8 Penn State returned to Pegula Ice Arena on Saturday for a conference rematch.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Nittany Lions skating without a 12th forward or an extra skater due to a series of injuries, they held on to capture the series sweep with a 6-3 win.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have consistently struggled to score first and do so early, but that factor was nowhere to be found on Saturday night.</p>\n                <p>To the sound of the Roar Zone\u2019s opening chants, alternate captain Jarod Crespo found forward JJ Wiebusch as he was entering the offensive zone. At the same time, a Notre Dame defender lost an edge, leaving one of Penn State\u2019s top producers all alone with goaltender Nicholas Kempf.</p>\n                <p>Wiebusch flicked a backhand pass over Kempf that ricocheted off both posts and in, giving the Nittany Lions an early lead.</p>\n                <p>The offensive dominance didn\u2019t let up, and the home team added another just over six minutes later. Freshman defenseman Jackson Smith unleashed his signature slap shot from Notre Dame\u2019s blue line to double Penn State\u2019s early lead.</p>\n                <p>Following up Friday night\u2019s 15 penalty night, the physicality was evident early on.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were first to the box after the officials called freshman Lev Katzin for a holding penalty, but they held off Notre Dame's top-ten-ranked power-play unit.</p>\n                <p>Just over a minute after the first penalty expired, the blue and white went right back on the penalty kill, this time after defenseman Carter Schade went to the box for hooking.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Irish only had 17 seconds on the power play before defenseman Henry Nelson was sent to the box for interference, with the next minute and a half being 4-on-4 hockey.</p>\n                <p>As the first frame was coming to a close, Notre Dame stunned the crowd in Hockey Valley into silence when its relatively quiet offense scored two back-to-back goals just seconds apart to tie the game.</p>\n                <p>The first goal was scored by forward Brennan Ali with just 1:36 left to go in the period, and junior Cole Knuble\u2019s goal off the rebound came just 15 seconds later, to even the score heading into the first intermission.</p>\n                <p>Penn State regained some of its initial momentum in the middle frame, and freshman Gavin McKenna was there to capitalize on it. Smith picked up his second point of the night after he found McKenna off the rush, and the forward potted his fifth of the season.</p>\n                <p>Hockey Valley\u2019s energy matched the physicality level, and after Smith and Knuble got into it and were both given minor penalties, Pegula Ice Arena roared louder.</p>\n                <p>Another Fighting Irish penalty shortly after turned the 4-on-4 into a Nittany Lion power play. Instead of giving the blue and white an advantage, however, Notre Dame\u2019s Sutter Muzzatti notched a shorthanded goal and tied the game for the second time.</p>\n                <p>Three back-to-back penalties through the next five minutes of play maintained the theme of the weekend of special teams battles.</p>\n                <p>After nine total penalties, the game finally saw its first power play goal. DiMarsico \u2014 who registered a hat trick on Friday night, including two goals on the power play \u2014 cleaned up a loose puck around Kempf\u2019s crease, and retook Penn State\u2019s lead heading into the final period.</p>\n                <p>The third period held much of the same, with a rotation of Nittany Lions and Fighting Irish skaters heading to the box, but both teams struggled to capitalize on their opportunities.</p>\n                <p>After McKenna\u2019s initial goal, the momentum shift from the forward was evident. The top 2026 NHL draft prospect\u2019s speed and skill provided multiple high-danger chances throughout the game, and his second of the night seemed almost inevitable.</p>\n                <p>It finally came with about nine minutes to go in the game, after the Yukon, Whitehorse native fired home a loose puck in front of Kempf\u2019s net.</p>\n                <p>McKenna\u2019s second of the night was followed up by an empty net goal from captain Dane Dowiak to seal the 6-3 win and series sweep for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State begins a tough Big Ten stretch, first traveling to No. 2 Wisconsin for a 7 p.m. puck drop on Jan. 23.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lily Dorf | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After the excitement of the holiday season fades and students return to school to finish out the academic year, many feel as though there is nothing exciting to anticipate. However, some Pennsylvania locals \u2014 and the surrounding states \u2014 may disagree.</p>\n                <p>Groundhog Day, celebrated annually on Feb. 2 in Punxsutawney, Pa. is a cultural tradition in which a groundhog \u2014 named Punxsutawney Phil \u2014 is brought out from his burrow to predict whether winter will last for another six weeks or an early spring will arrive.</p>\n                <p>While fans typically have to travel to Punxsutawney for the event, State College residents were able to have a special chance to see the famous furry friend.</p>\n                <p>Penn State students and State College locals gathered at The Press: Cider &amp; Craft Beverage Taphouse to meet Punxsutawney Phil and his handlers. Some attendees dressed for the occasion, wearing top hats and suits to match the groundhog\u2019s handlers.</p>\n                <p>The event started at 2 p.m., and by 2:30 p.m., the line to see Phil and his crew was wrapped around the block.</p>\n                <p>The Press is owned by four lifelong friends, who happen to all be from Punxsutawney, Pa. One of the owners, Andrew Divelbiss, said he wanted to bring Phil to Happy Valley so he could experience life outside of Punxsutawney.</p>\n                <p>\u201cState College is such a good town to introduce people to Phil,\u201d Divelbiss said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big thing that everybody in Punxsutawney tries to do is spread the incredible thing of Punxsutawney Phil.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With the help of his family, who are a part of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, Divelbiss said he was able to bring his family and business together through the event.</p>\n                <p>Excitement buzzed through the line as students and locals waited to see Phil and hopefully and take pictures with him.</p>\n                <p>During the event, handlers and club members handed out Punxsutawney Groundhog Club tokens and top hats.</p>\n                <p>Many attendees learned about the event online, but Sophia Balaratna said she heard through word of mouth and knew she wanted to attend.</p>\n                <p>As a Pennsylvania native, Balaratna said she grew up hearing about Punxsutawney Phil and wanted to meet him.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was really excited, I\u2019m a big fan of Phil,\u201d Balaratna, a fourth-year studying mechanical engineering said.</p>\n                <p>She left him with some encouraging words for his big day coming up, and to hopefully help get the prediction she wants to have for the seasonal weather.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI love you Phil, but please no more winter,\u201d Balaratna said.</p>\n                <p>Sagufta Muktadir, also a Pennsylvania native, said she knew she needed to attend the moment she read about the event.</p>\n                <p>Muktadir, a fourth-year studying biomedical engineering, said she and her family are fond of Phil, but have never traveled to Punxsutawney for Groundhog Day.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI love him,\u201d Muktadir said. \u201cI love his predictions and everything \u2014 I was super hyped to come and see him in person.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After starting the season 3-0, Penn State got a look at its first ranked team of the season, hosting No. 9 Lewis in Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>On Saturday night, the Nittany Lions picked up their first ranked win of the season, beating the Flyers 3-1 to hand them their first loss on the season.</p>\n                <p>The first two points of the opening set the two split at 1-1 after a Penn State opening serve error that Lewis matched when it committed a mistake of the same nature.</p>\n                <p>It was all Lewis in the early running, though, as it jumped to a 7-3 advantage in the set after a few more Nittany Lion errors.</p>\n                <p>Penn State used a timeout when it went down 11-6. Only one of Lewis\u2019s points came from a kill, as all the rest came from errant blue and white serves or attacks.</p>\n                <p>Owen Rose and Jaxon Herr gave the Nittany Lions their first lead of the night after a block assist gave them a 17-16 edge. Penn State rode that wave to the end to capture the first set 25-21 after back-to-back Sean Harvey kills.</p>\n                <p>Now one step closer to a top-10 win, Penn State got on the board first in the second set and jumped up to a 4-1 lead after back-to-back Gaige Gabriel kills and an ace from Herr.</p>\n                <p>Lewis used a timeout after the blue and white took an 11-8 advantage after a Matthew Luoma kill.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions felt themselves closing in on a 2-0 lead on the night after capturing a seven-point lead in the latter stages of the second set, thanks to consecutive Flyers errors.</p>\n                <p>A Luoma kill off the assist from Herr allowed Penn State to capture the second set 25-18 to move one set closer to a sweep over a top-10 team.</p>\n                <p>Once again, Penn State started the action due to a Lewis error. It was the Flyers\u2019 12th attack error of the night.</p>\n                <p>For the first time in a while, though, the Nittany Lions found themselves down and facing a 5-2 deficit thanks to Oguzhan Oguz picking up his sixth and seventh kills of the night \u2013 the most of any Flyer at that point.</p>\n                <p>Another Gaige kill was just another point Penn State traded with Lewis until an 8-8 standstill turned into a two-point lead for the Flyers, thanks to a Gauthier Brozak kill that he followed up with an ace.</p>\n                <p>Lewis extended its lead to 15-13 before a Tristan Hassell kill made it a one-point game that Penn State capitalized on and turned into a little scoring run, as it captured a 16-15 lead thanks to a Brozak error and a Gaige ace.</p>\n                <p>Inching closer to a win, the blue and white snuck up to 20-18 after another Harvey kill \u2013 his 10th of the night.</p>\n                <p>The Flyers weren\u2019t going away that easily, though, and Penn State took a timeout after a 3-0 Lewis scoring run put the Nittany Lions down 21-20.</p>\n                <p>After some more back-and-forth, Lewis did just enough to win the third set 25-23 and keep the night going after a Daniel Haber kill.</p>\n                <p>Following the rest of the night, the fourth set started off tight until the Flyers jumped out to a 5-3 lead in the early running after kills from Brozak and Haber.</p>\n                <p>Consecutive Hassell kills gave him six on the night, but Lewis was still comfortably ahead, holding a 12-7 advantage prior to the Nittany Lions calling a timeout.</p>\n                <p>It was all Hassell as Penn State was closing in on the lead after the six-foot-six freshman picked up his eighth kill to cut the deficit to 16-13.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions battled back and went on a 3-0 run, with Hassell picking up two more kills to gain a 23-21 edge.</p>\n                <p>Momentum shifted back the other way for a moment, but Penn State held on and captured the fourth set 25-22 to secure the 3-1 win.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State hits the road for the first time this season for a two-game series against McKendree next weekend.

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State got itself back on track following its first loss in the AHA to Mercyhurst with a 4-1 victory over conference-opponent Syracuse in Game 1. The Nittany Lions returned to Tennity Ice Pavilion in Syracuse, New York, on Saturday afternoon for Game 2 of the series, looking for their first sweep since late November.</p>\n                <p>Unlike the previous meetings with the Orange, Penn State was given a run for its money, gritting out a 3-2 victory behind a pair of goals by captain Tessa Janecke. The Nittany Lions improved to 21-4 on the season, and secured the season-sweep over Syracuse.</p>\n                <p>Goaltender Maddy Campbell was given her fifth-straight start for the blue and white, in Katie DeSa\u2019s absence due to an undisclosed injury. The Courtice, Ontario, native made 13 saves on 14 shots in Friday\u2019s victory before closing out the series with 31 saves on 33 shots on Saturday, improving to 5-2 on the season.</p>\n                <p>The teams jumped out of the gates with blazing speed, with the Nittany Lions getting play started when Abby Stonehouse and McKenna Walsh were stopped at the crease on a 2-on-1. The Orange\u2019s Jackson Kinsler responded with a breakaway that was stopped by Campbell.</p>\n                <p>But Kinsler\u2019s next attempt broke the ice. Just over three minutes into the game, the Madison, Wisconsin, native picked up her own rebound and beat Campbell under her glove.</p>\n                <p>However, the AHA-leading Nittany Lions didn\u2019t stay down for long. Grace Outwater floated a backhand shot past freshman goaltender Ava Drabyk to tie the game, with 14:10 left in the period.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s powerplay got to work midway through the first period, when Emma Gnade tripped Janecke in the offensive zone. Janecke responded 23 seconds into the advantage, striding down the left side boards before cutting to the middle and firing a wrist shot past Drabyk to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>Just over five minutes into the second period, the Orange were awarded their first power-play opportunity as Grace Tullock headed to sin bin for tripping. Maya D\u2019Arcy ensured that the special teams remained perfect, as she tallied her first of the season 30-seconds later to tie the game at 2-2.</p>\n                <p>With 11:25 remaining in the middle frame, Celia Wiegand\u2019s interference infraction gave the Nittany Lions their second power play of the game. However, Drabyk made a series of saves in tight to keep the game knotted.</p>\n                <p>The penalty box was again populated as Mya Vaslet took a boarding penalty in the offensive zone. Syracuse peppered Campbell with shots, but the Nittany Lions cleared the penalty after sending the puck down the length of the ice.</p>\n                <p>Following a back-and-forth affair in Penn State\u2019s zone, the Nittany Lions cleared the puck to Janecke, who entered the zone with speed. She made a nifty move to the slot before rifling a shot under Drabyk\u2019s globe for her 16th goal of the season, now leading the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Despite applying offensive pressure early in the third period, the officials called Penn State\u2019s Maddy Christian to the penalty box for interference. The blue and white easily cleared the penalty, but struggled to generate offense throughout the early goings of the frame.</p>\n                <p>That was until Heidi Knoll took a tripping penalty right off a face-off outside of Penn State\u2019s zone. Although the Nittany Lions weren\u2019t able to find the net, they shaved valuable time off the clock.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white continued to dominate the possession, winding down the clock with an intense forecheck. Syracuse was unable to pull Drabyk until the 48-second mark, leading to the Orange having limited time to tie the game.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white cleared the puck with one second remaining, and Campbell made a final save to secure the 3-2 victory.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Senior goaltender Katie DeSa has remained out with an undisclosed injury since Jan. 2, when she was shaken up midway through the third period against No. 2 Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will stay in the state of New York, travelling to Ithaca to face No. 10 Cornell for the second time this season.

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will stay on the road and travel nearly four hours east of Iowa City to Evanston, Illinois to take on Northwestern in the second dual of the weekend.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will take on the Wildcats at 3 p.m. Sunday, with the matchup being streamed on Big Ten Plus.</p>\n                <p>No. 1 Penn State is coming off a 32-3 victory against No. 4 Iowa in front of a raucous Carver-Hawkeye Arena. On the other side, Northwestern fell to No. 18 Wisconsin, 28-12, in Madison, Wisconsin. Now, the Nittany Lions will head to Evanston in an attempt to keep their historic win streak alive.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how each weight class matches up ahead of the Sunday matinee dual.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 2 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 26 Dedrick Navarro (NU)</p>\n                <p>Dedrick Navarro\u2019s ranking understates his ability after a victory over No. 11 Nicolar Rivera. However, Rivera isn\u2019t in the same tier as Luke Lilledahl, who just defeated No. 6 Dean Peterson.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl brings a style that isn\u2019t normal, a quick, slippery approach that catches most opponents off guard. Coming off a convincing victory, the Nittany Lion could get back to his bonus-point scoring.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 24 Sean Spidle (NU)</p>\n                <p>Continuing with what are the best matches on paper, Marcus Blaze and Sean Spidle will face off in a young vs. old match. Blaze is a true freshman, who\u2019s still undefeated, while Spidle holds an 11-5 record as a redshirt senior.</p>\n                <p>Blaze is coming off a victory over 2025 national finalist, Drake Ayala, and could continue his dominant start against a wrestler with less caliber than that of Ayala.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 7 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 32 Billy Dekraker (NU)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis was the only wrestler to lose in the Nittany Lions\u2019 dual against Iowa. However, he\u2019ll take on a significantly lower-ranked opponent in Billy Dekraker. The Wildcat came out victorious against an unranked Wisconsin wrestler, but will take on a top-10 wrestler in Davis.</p>\n                <p>Davis is still acclimating himself to full-time wrestling after getting his redshirt pulled. He was noticeably gassed in his match against No. 11 Nasir Bailey of Iowa, but could put that behind him to get his first ranked victory of the season.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. Sam Cartella (NU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness proved he\u2019s a force to be reckoned with after defeating No. 17 Ryder Block of Iowa. Against Northwestern, Van Ness could face an unranked Sam Cartella.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness will put his 12-0 record on the line against Cartella or August Hibler, who wrestled against Wisconsin. Hibler fell 11-6 to No. 16 Joseph Zargo and would face an even tougher opponent on Sunday if he wrestles both matches on the weekend.</p>\n                <p>With the Wildcats\u2019 149-pound starter still unknown, it could allow Van Ness to showcase his strength and earn bonus points.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Gunnar Myers (NU)</p>\n                <p>Starting at 149 pounds with Van Ness, and continuing at 157 pounds, the Nittany Lions could really catapult the dual score. PJ Duke won a tight battle against No. 12 Jordan Williams of Iowa, but gets a lighter opponent in Gunnar Myers, who\u2019s unranked on the season.</p>\n                <p>Myers lost by a major decision to No. 26 Luke Mechler, a 23-rank difference from Duke who\u2019s undefeated and a national title contender. Duke could add yet another bonus-point victory to his resum\u00e9, while remaining undefeated in his inaugural season.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. Jacob Bostelman (NU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink proved yet again he\u2019s on a tier of his own against Iowa. He took down No. 3 Michael Caliendo for the seventh time in his career, extending the gap between him and the Hawkeye after Caliendo closed it at the Big Ten Championships and the NCAA Championships.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink will face a significantly worse opponent on paper. Jacob Bostelman lost by tech fall to No. 26 Cody Goebel. Mesenbrink\u2019s gas tank has been unmatched ever since his championship match against Iowa State\u2019s David Carr in 2024.</p>\n                <p>With a significantly stronger emphasis on back points and falls, Mesenbrink could add to his pinfall total.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 32 Eddie Enright (NU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines will take on Northwestern\u2019s final ranked wrestler in chronological order from lightest to heaviest weight classes.</p>\n                <p>Haines wrestled a close match against Gabe Arnold, who has bounced around multiple weight classes during his career. However, Haines will take on a wrestler who\u2019s 18-5 heading into Sunday. The Nittany Lion has also had more of a focus on back points, especially after fully filling into the 174-pound weight class.</p>\n                <p>Enright will have his hands full with Haines, who provides a mix of speed and power, and is currently in a tier of his own at 174.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 4 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. J.D. Perez (NU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh had arguably the biggest win of the entire season, earning a defensively focused victory over No. 1 Angelo Ferrari. Welsh showed poise and patience, defeating Ferrari in tiebreakers, keeping Ferrari down for 27 seconds.</p>\n                <p>Now, Welsh can show more of his aggressive side against J.D. Perez. The Wildcat took down Caleb Dennee, 7-6, but will have his hands full with potentially the next No. 1-wrestler at 184 when the updated InterMat poll is released.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. Alex Smith (NU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr is fully back from his injury, and didn\u2019t have to face one of his initial big tests in Massoma Endene, who\u2019s no longer on Iowa\u2019s roster.</p>\n                <p>Barr will take on another unranked opponent in Alex Smith, who\u2019s struggled against ranked wrestlers. Smith lost by fall to No. 28 Wyatt Ingham of Wisconsin, and Barr appears to be a different kind of beast as the leading candidate for the national title with his No. 1 ranking.</p>\n                <p>The final weight classes could prove to be the dagger in a blowout victory for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 13 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Gabe Christenson (NU)</p>\n                <p>Another wrestler who\u2019s coming off the biggest win of his season is Cole Mirasola, who is riding high heading into his unranked matchup. Mirasola took down No. 5 Ben Kueter of Iowa, solidifying his spot as an All-American threat.</p>\n                <p>Gabe Christenson hasn\u2019t had success against ranked wrestlers, and Mirasola provides a different kind of heavyweight for him. The Nittany Lion is one of the more undersized heavyweights, something that\u2019ll allow the Wildcat to match up better, as he\u2019s listed on the roster at 197 pounds.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola will be the heavier wrestler for likely one of the only times in his career against a wrestler who typically wrestles at 197.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Heading into No. 8 Penn State and Notre Dame\u2019s first meeting of the season, they were two of the three most penalized teams in the country, meaning a special teams battle was likely ahead. After a combined 14 penalties and 41 penalty minutes, those proved to be the difference maker Friday night.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 special teams propelled them to a 4-1 conference victory over the Fighting Irish.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white took to the ice in front of a lively Roar Zone \u2014 the first time the home team had played in front of the packed student section in over two months.</p>\n                <p>Both teams were dealing with holes in the lineups after Penn State was hit with the injury bug, forcing it to skate with only 11 forwards, and Notre Dame\u2019s leading scorer, defenseman Paul Fischer, was suspended for the two-game series.</p>\n                <p>The opening minutes were largely a back-and-forth battle, with both teams trying to find their offensive momentum.</p>\n                <p>The game saw its first penalty a little over halfway through the first period, after Notre Dame\u2019s Jayden Davis was called for interference, sending the Nittany Lions to the power play.</p>\n                <p>About 40 seconds in, forward Matt DiMarsico broke the ice for the blue and white, set up by a tic-tac-toe passing sequence with Gavin McKenna and Luke Misa.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Irish \u2014 and their No. 7 nationally ranked power play \u2014 got their own opportunity a few minutes later, after senior defenseman Jarod Crespo was called for holding.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s penalty kill unit, along with a very solid performance from goaltender Josh Fleming, kept Notre Dame off the board on the man-advantage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was really happy with the penalty kill,\u201d Guy Gadowsky said. \u201c(Notre Dame\u2019s) an excellent power play team\u2026but all in all, I thought all game the penalty kill was really good.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With just over a minute to go in the first frame, Davis headed back to the box, this time for high-sticking, but Penn State couldn\u2019t capitalize on its second attempt.</p>\n                <p>The physicality, while always present, ramped up in the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>Notre Dame\u2019s Cole Brown laid a high hit on captain Dane Dowiak, and the freshman was awarded a five-minute major and a game misconduct, while the blue and white headed to an extended man-advantage.</p>\n                <p>DiMarsico once again took advantage of the extra attacker and fired a shot on net that was redirected out in front of goaltender Nicholas Kempf and found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>Notre Dame answered with a power play goal of its own shortly after, after Crespo made his second trip to the penalty box.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white regained its two-goal lead and tallied its third power play score of the night with about two minutes to go in the middle frame, after Sutter Muzzatti\u2019s roughing penalty led to Misa tallying his third point of the night off a one-timer that rocketed past Kempf.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe were moving pucks really well, I mean, we were playing with speed, we\u2019re winning faceoffs too,\u201d Misa said. \u201c(the power play) was just clicking today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The theme of penalties continued on into the final period, first with the Nittany Lions\u2019 Carter Schade being sent to the box for hooking. The home team\u2019s penalty kill once again held strong and maintained its lead.</p>\n                <p>The intensity boiled over late in the third period, starting with defenseman Jackson Smith laying out a Notre Dame skater to the roar of the crowd. Muzzatti retaliated and went after freshman McKenna along the boards, and was quickly surrounded by Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Both Muzzatti and Smith walked away with penalties, but the 4-on-4 quickly turned to a 4-on-3 after Reese Laubach was given a slashing penalty 30 seconds later.</p>\n                <p>After pulling the goaltender, Notre Dame had a two-skater advantage for its last push in an attempt to close its gap, but the blue and white\u2019s strong defensive efforts continued through the final minutes.</p>\n                <p>DiMarsico sealed the game and a dominant performance, with an empty net goal to tally his third hat trick of the season, and 13th total goal.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about him because I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know how he does what he does,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHis mind is elite. His stick is better than elite.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

The next night, forward Braeden Ford was helped off the ice with a lower-body injury that head coach Guy Gadowsky said will sideline him for a \u201csignificant amount of time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With forward Keaton Peters out for the season and forward Shea Van Olm sidelined with an injury, the Nittany Lions were thin offensively as they welcomed Notre Dame on Friday at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Down to just 11 forwards, Penn State defeated Notre Dame 4-1. The win propelled the Nittany Lions to 15-6 and marked their fourth straight Big Ten victory.</p>\n                <p>Following a goaltender interference penalty against Notre Dame\u2019s Jayden Davis, Penn State earned the game\u2019s first power play. And on the man advantage, two of its stars connected with a new power-play linemate to break through.</p>\n                <p>As he typically does when given time and space, a calm Gavin McKenna scanned the ice before lasering a pass to Luka Misa. The freshman forward, who filled in for Cerrato on Penn State\u2019s top power-play line, one-timed a pass to Matt DiMarsico, who ripped a slap shot into the top right corner to give the Nittany Lions a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>But Misa wasn\u2019t done there.</p>\n                <p>After DiMarsico and Notre Dame\u2019s Evan Werner traded goals, the Nittany Lions were back on the power play. And off a slot feed from Ben Schoen, Misa rifled one beyond Nicholas Kempf\u2019s outstretched glove to give Penn State a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n                <p>A MISA MISSILE!!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAre?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeAre</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HockeyValley?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HockeyValley</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7gPZijln2t\">pic.twitter.com/7gPZijln2t</a>&mdash; Penn State Men\u2019s Hockey (@PennStateMHKY) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennStateMHKY/status/2012336628862165028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 17, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>It was his seventh point in his last five games \u2014 a turning point for a forward whose lack of production had undermined a terrific start to his freshman campaign.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThings have just started going my way,\u201d Misa said. \u201cI feel like I had a lot of chances in the (first) half, but things just weren't going in. So it's nice to see things go down.\u201d</p>\n                <p>To provide context to the extent of Penn State\u2019s injury bug, it forced Gadowsky to play three defensemen on the same line several times, with extra skater and natural defenseman Nick Fascia serving as a de facto forward. The team even left the fourth-line right winger spot blank on the pregame lineup sheet because there was no healthy forward to fill it with.</p>\n                <p>While some played different roles, forward Dane Dowiak showed up as his typical gritty self, and Penn State\u2019s captain drew two penalties, each leading to a power-play goal.</p>\n                <p>Early in the second period, Dowiak outraced Notre Dame\u2019s Cole Brown for a loose puck along the boards of Penn State\u2019s defensive zone. A frustrated Brown leveled Dowiak with a booming hit to the head, drawing the ire of the Pegula fans.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDane is a tough kid. When you talk about a guy stepping up in a leadership role, that's what you had from him tonight,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe played tough. He won faceoffs. He stuck up for his team. He did everything that a leader should do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The officials handed Brown a five-minute major and a game misconduct, which led to Penn State\u2019s first tally. Later in the period, Dowiak caught another high hit while scrapping for a loose puck among three Fighting Irish skaters.</p>\n                <p>The defense cleared the puck, and Dowiak drew another penalty, this one a roughing call on Sutter Muzzatti. Misa scored shortly after to give the Nittany Lions some cushion in a tight contest \u2014 a testament to his captain\u2019s resolute play.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Dane) is our captain. He's our leader,\u201d DiMarsico said. \u201cTo see a guy take a couple of hits like that and not retaliate at all sends a message to the power play that you gotta have that same work ethic. If someone's going to take a hit like that and not respond, you better make it worth it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>After securing its highest-ever home opening score against Yale last weekend, Penn State women\u2019s gymnastics traveled to Illinois to try to better last weekend\u2019s historic effort.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started a winning streak with a victory over Illinois, 196.075-194.100, short of last week\u2019s massive Week One score.</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>The first away meet of the year brought new challenges for Penn State, like opening on bars.</p>\n                <p>Ellie Monahan opened the rotation in a big way for head coach Sarah Brown. She was a bit short on her first handstand and pirouette on the low bar, but just a small hop on her dismount opened the meet with a strong 9.775.</p>\n                <p>Jessica Johanson followed it up with an ever cleaner routine. Similar to Monahan, she had to take a hop on her dismount, also scoring a 9.775. Elizabeth Leary put up a massive routine in the middle of the lineup, nailing her straddled jaeger to overshoot connection, followed by a perfectly stuck dismount. She improved from last week\u2019s routine with a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Ava Piedrahita, coming off her ACL injury last season, was back in the bars lineup. She showcased textbook form throughout, taking just a small shuffle on her dismount, putting a huge exclamation mark on her bars debut with a massive 9.925.</p>\n                <p>Ava Cash was aggressive on her opening handstand, but with her shoulders and hips too far over the bar, she came off. Starting her whole routine over after the fall, the freshman scored a low 8.900.</p>\n                <p>Looking to drop Cash\u2019s score, Dani Lartronica did not hold back. She hit her handstands right on top of the bar, nailed her piked jaeger, and stuck her toe-shoot piked half for a 9.875 to end the rotation.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, on the vault, Illinois showed off a few strong Yurchenko fulls with some key missteps in the lineup for a 48.625 trailing Penn State\u2019s 49.200 total. The highlight was Chloe Cho\u2019s 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Leary opened up with a powerful Yurchenko full, resulting in a large hop back after a strong block, scoring a 9.700. Cash followed it up with a massive Yurchenko full. She had some leg separation on the table and a hop back for a 9.700.</p>\n                <p>Bringing back her Yurchenko one and a half this season, Kaempfer slightly underrotated her vault, needing to take a step back. Starting out of a 10.0, the sophomore managed a 9.775. Johanson had one of the strongest Yurchenko fulls with just a small hop for a rotation-high 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Latronica had another small hop on her Yurchenko full for a 9.775. Piedhraita took just a small hop on her half on, pike off for another 9.775 to anchor the rotation.</p>\n                <p>On the bars, Illinois picked up the momentum. Cho continued her incredible night with a massive 9.950 to pass Piedrahita to win the event. Lyden Saltness ended the rotation with a 9.900 as well, but it wasn\u2019t enough as Penn State led after two rotations, 98.050-97.550.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Not Penn State\u2019s strongest event, the Nittany Lions needed to keep up the momentum. Johanson, not in the floor lineup last weekend, led off and did just that. She opened with a strong double pike. One and a half into a front half with another strong landing to get the rotation off to the right start with a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Monhanan, a front tumbler built off Johanson\u2019s performance. She opened with a front double full and finished with a front lay front full, all with solid landings for another 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Maul opened her routine with a massive stuck double tuck, not needing to lunge back. On her second, she was short on her layout after underrotating her one and a half for a low 9.625.</p>\n                <p>Bella Misiura opened with an E pass, a front double full. She finished with a front full but was unable to continue her front layout, needing to tuck her legs, bringing her start value down, scoring a low 9.475.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Kramer tried to get the Nittany Lions back on track. Another strong front tumbler, she opened with a big front double full and finished with a Rudi to layout stepout to score a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Kalea McElligott anchored the rotation with a gorgeous double tuck and a one-and-a-half to front layout for a 9.825 to help Penn State hold the lead.</p>\n                <p>On the beam, Illinois faced a lot of struggles, including a fall. However, Cho continued her strong night with a big 9.675. Despite their struggles on the floor, the Nittany Lions still led Illinois 146.925 or 146.575-145.850 going into the final rotation.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Closing out on beam, the blue and white bounced back from a low 48.875 on the floor. Monahan led off with a front toss to swing down acro series, taking a small hop on her dismount for a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Kramer bailed her backhandspring-layout stepout to keep the momentum going for a 9.775. Maul crushed her triple series and stuck her landing cold for a huge 9.850. McElligott followed up Maul with another massive triple series and stuck a dismount for a matching 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Leary followed with another triple series and stuck dismount, copying and pasting three straight routines for a 9.775. Latronica nailed her series as well, showcasing her flexibility and clean lines for a rotation-high 9.875 in the anchor position.</p>\n                <p>Despite a strong floor rotation, including Cho\u2019s event-winning tying 9.825, it wasn\u2019t enough for Illinois to overtake Penn State\u2019s strong beam finish.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State welcomes Big Ten foe Maryland at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 25, in Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Fisher | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It wasn\u2019t long ago Penn State was winless in Big Ten play, scratching and clawing for its first conference win in South Bend to begin the second half of the 2024-25 campaign. In that instance, the Nittany Lions persevered and defeated Notre Dame to spark a historic 23-game run for the program.</p>\n                <p>Friday, a mere calendar year later, the roles reversed, as the Fighting Irish were a bleak 0-10 in Big Ten play. This time, it was Penn State defending home ice.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions did what Notre Dame couldn\u2019t a year ago, winning in their home arena by a final score of 4-1, and extending their win streak to four games.</p>\n                <p>First period</p>\n                <p>Penn State came out of the gates firing on all cylinders. The Nittany Lions earned 10 shots on goal through the midway point of the first period, controlling play and dominating offensive-zone time, in large part due to winger Gavin McKenna.</p>\n                <p>That consistent offensive effort reaped its rewards with just under eight minutes remaining in the frame after Notre Dame center Jayden Davis was pinned with an interference penalty, putting Penn State on the man-advantage.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 power-play unit took the ice and looked the sharpest it has all season. Just 40 seconds into the man-advantage, McKenna engaged in a tic-tac-toe action with wingers Luke Misa and Matt DiMarsico, where he found Misa across ice, who one-tapped the puck to DiMarsico in the bumper.</p>\n                <p>The junior sniped a relatively wide-open net, breaking the ice and giving the Nittany Lions a 1-0 advantage, which was the only scoring for either team all period.</p>\n                <p>Second period</p>\n                <p>Penn State entered the second frame on a short man-advantage, and while it didn\u2019t last long, the Nittany Lions quickly returned to the power play after Notre Dame winger Cole Brown laid a massive hit on center Dane Dowiak along the boards, which the referees determined as a major penalty and game misconduct after a short review.</p>\n                <p>Unlike the first period, however, Penn State was lifeless in the man-advantage. Over four minutes of game action went by with minimal offensive zone time for the Nittany Lions. But in the final minute of the major penalty, Penn State took a 2-0 lead with a little bit of luck.</p>\n                <p>DiMarsico leisurely controlled the puck by the right dot before firing a low shot into several bodies in front of Kempf. His shot ricocheted off a skate and into the back of the net to extend the Nittany Lions\u2019 advantage.</p>\n                <p>The story of the second frame continued to be defined by penalties, as the fourth one of the period, given to defenseman Jarod Crespo, put the Fighting Irish on a 4-on-3. Winger Evan Werner scored on a wrist shot just 37 seconds into Notre Dame\u2019s power play, cutting Penn State\u2019s lead to 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Over the final 10 minutes of the frame, there were three more penalties, bringing the period total up to seven. The Nittany Lions were the only team to capitalize on one of them, as Misa scored a one-timer off an assist from winger Ben Schoen, with just under three minutes remaining, extending Penn State\u2019s lead to 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Third period</p>\n                <p>The third period showcased more back-and-forth action, but nothing added to the scoreboard. Center Reese Laubach owned the best chance, as he had nearly a wide-open net from a rebound off the boards, but Kempf made a sprawling save to keep Notre Dame\u2019s deficit at two.</p>\n                <p>Three penalties, from both teams combined, in the span of 36 seconds, played into a hectic final five minutes of regulation. The Fighting Irish owned the 4-on-3 due to the penalties. Not much came of it, though, as Notre Dame went scoreless despite Werner ringing a post.</p>\n                <p>Penn State netminder Josh Fleming was a big proponent of the Nittany Lions killing off their penalties. He stood tall to maintain the Nittany Lions\u2019 lead, finishing the night saving 39-of-40 shots, good for a .975 save percentage.</p>\n                <p>DiMarsico hit the dagger on Friday, scoring the empty-net goal for his third hat trick of the season.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Center Charlie Cerrato was inactive for a second consecutive game with a day-to-day injury, while winger Braedon Ford remained out with a lower-body injury coach Guy Gadowsky disclosed as \u201clong-term,\u201d on Monday.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, winger Shea Van Olm was inactive with a day-to-day injury.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Penn State-Notre Dame series will conclude at 8 p.m. Saturday at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 1 Penn State wrestling renewed its greatest rivalry against the No. 4 Iowa Hawkeyes on Friday, traveling to Carver-Hawkeye Arena for its biggest test of the season thus far.</p>\n                <p>Though the Iowa program is mired in controversy in the past week, they feature a lineup with members who could\u2019ve tested the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Penn State defeated the Hawkeyes by a score of 32-3.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 2 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs No. 6 Dean Peterson (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>These two started off with a blaze, with both aiming for an attempt leading to each other flipping out of the circle. Dean Peterson needed a second to recover following the scrum, and when he returned to the circle, Luke Lilledahl took him down.</p>\n                <p>Peterson shocked Lilledahl by reversing the control for two points and the pair continued a scrappy battle without further scoring for the rest of the first round.</p>\n                <p>Peterson brought the bout within one point with an escape to start the second frame. He wrapped his arms around Lilledahl and nearly brought him down before Lilledahl countered with a left-handed high crotch to make Peterson lose balance, followed by a double-leg takedown. The second round ended with blood time for Lilledahl.</p>\n                <p>After Peterson let Lilledahl up to start the third, he secured another takedown to extend his lead to 11-4. Peterson stood up before riding time reached a minute, and Lilledahl was unable to secure a takedown despite holding Peterson\u2019s leg for the final 30 seconds.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl defeated Peterson 11-5 in a gritty revenge match after losing to him a year ago.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 3, Iowa 0</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs No. 8 Drake Ayala (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze and Drake Ayala had a longer feeling out process than the previous match, but neither gained control as they stalemated the entire first round, trying to secure a collar-tie up against each other.</p>\n                <p>Ayala opened the second round on top and kept Lilledahl locked up for 40 seconds, picking his leg every time Lilledahl reached his feet. Ayala received a stall warning after running out of bounds when Blaze launched an attack. After Ayala received a stall penalty, Blaze completed the takedown before Ayala could reach the edge.</p>\n                <p>Ayala started the third with a quick escape and began putting pressure on Blaze, pushing him and launching the attacks, looking to come back from a 4-2 deficit. Blaze stalled as Ayala tried to pull him down, receiving a warning but securing the decision, earning a chorus of boos from the Iowa crowd.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 6, Iowa 0</p>\n                <p>141: No. 7 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs No. 11 Nasir Bailey (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Nasir Bailey has had a relatively down year, but showed his talent in this match, securing Iowa\u2019s first victory. Bailey took down Braeden Davis in the first period and stumped his offense for the final two frames.</p>\n                <p>After escaping in the second, Davis went on the offensive but Bailey continually avoided him, winning 3-2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 6, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs No. 17 Ryder Block (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Ryder Block opened aggressively, and after keeping himself low to the mat, picked Shayne Van Ness\u2019 leg to secure the first takedown. Van Ness quickly responded with a takedown of his own thirty seconds later.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness opened the second frame on top and rode out the entire period to hold the tie at 4-4, while accumulating over two minutes of riding time. Van Ness escaped in the third to secure the lead, but Block immediately picked his leg.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness picked his leg to counter and locked Block in a bow-and-arrow leading to a takedown and a four-point near-fall securing the 13-4 major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 10, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs No. 12 Jordan Williams (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke opened the match with vengeance, backing up Jordan Williams and nearly securing the takedown before his hold on Williams was deemed potentially dangerous. He continued shooting for the ankle after resetting, but couldn\u2019t get Williams off his feet.</p>\n                <p>After Williams escaped five seconds into the second period, Duke again went on the offensive and had Williams on the verge of neutral danger. As the clock expired, no points were awarded but assistant coach Cody Sanderson threw the challenge brick on Duke\u2019s behalf. The review upheld the call, and Duke entered the third trailing 1-0.</p>\n                <p>Duke stood up even faster than Williams did to go back to neutral, tied 1-1 in the third. After catching a shot from Williams, Duke circled around and landed the first takedown of the bout. Williams couldn\u2019t break the collar-and-elbow tie up for the rest of the bout, giving Duke the 4-1 decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 13, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 3 Michael Caliendo (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink and Michael Caliendo renewed their lopsided rivalry for the first time this season, and the seventh time in college. Mesenbrink has won all six prior matches.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink notched the first takedown, but only kept Caliendo down for fifteen seconds. Caliendo got a hold of Mesenbrink\u2019s leg, but Mesenbrink escaped unscathed. Caliendo received a stall call but remained on his feet using a defensive posture for the remainder of the first period.</p>\n                <p>Caliendo started visibly frustrating Mesenbrink in Round 2, not giving up a takedown until there were nine seconds left on the clock. Mesenbrink quickly escaped to start the third. A tired Caliendo looked resigned as his offensive attacks slowed in the final minute.</p>\n                <p>After Mesenbrink started attacking again, Caliendo got a stall call and Mesenbrink went on a mad scramble to land one last takedown in the final seconds to extend the lead to 11-2 and earn a major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 17, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Gabe Arnold (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Gabe Arnold filled in for All-American Patrick Kennedy, who has never beaten Levi Haines. It was Arnold\u2019s first NCAA match against a Nittany Lion after he had words for the program last season, but didn\u2019t end up wrestling in the dual at the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Haines held control immediately in the match, securing a takedown two minutes in and keeping his hands locked around Arnold as he scrambled out of the circle. Arnold escaped after a clock malfunction delayed the whistle, catching Haines off guard with a quick jump. The rest of the first two periods were an uneventful stalemate.</p>\n                <p>Arnold stood up and brought the score to 4-2 with slightly over a minute remaining. The two were head-to-head for most of the last minute as Arnold searched for an opening. Three attacks by Arnold didn\u2019t reach past Haines\u2019 defensive stand and he secured another decision for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 20, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>184: No. 4 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 1 Angelo Ferrari (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>The most anticipated slate of the dual was the top-five matchup at 184 pounds. Redshirt freshman Angelo Ferrari hadn\u2019t given up a takedown since becoming Iowa\u2019s starter. His defensive stance of staying on a knee forced Welsh to be patient throughout the first period. Neither man launched a real attack in the first three minutes.</p>\n                <p>After Ferrari escaped after 25 seconds in Round 2, the match returned to a chronic stalemate. The wrestlers finally spent a prolonged amount of time locked up in the third round after Welsh drew the score even with an escape.</p>\n                <p>With 30 seconds remaining in round 3, Ferrari drew a stall warning and renegaded with Welsh, but the bout advanced to sudden victory, tied 1-1.</p>\n                <p>In the extra frame, Ferrari secured an under-hook and got a grip around Welsh for the closest attack of the match to that point. Welsh returned the favor, powering Ferrari down but was out of bounds as the clock passed one minute. The draw continued and sent the contest to tiebreakers.</p>\n                <p>Welsh deferred on the coin flip and rode Ferrari for 15 seconds before a stall call reset the mat, much to the dismay of the crowd in Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Welsh secured two more mat returns en route to a full 30 seconds of riding time.</p>\n                <p>Welsh debated his options for a minute before electing to take the bottom, just needing an escape to win. Welsh successfully broke Ferrari\u2019s grip, leaving the top-ranked wrestler 17 seconds to take him down. Welsh backed off multiple Ferrari attempts and secured the upset to a chorus of boos.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 23, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. Brody Sampson (IOWA)</p>\n                <p>Brody Sampson had his first match as Iowa\u2019s permanent 197 starter against the top-ranked wrestler in the class Josh Barr. Sampson took the spot after No. 4 Massoma Endene was removed from Iowa\u2019s roster earlier this week.</p>\n                <p>Barr welcomed Sampson with a takedown in the second minute. He led 6-1 following another takedown, and secured one more in the second period before locking Sampson in an assassin pin and securing the fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 29, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>285: No. 13 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. No. 5 Ben Kueter (Iowa)</p>\n                <p>The dual ended with the heavyweight bout between Cole Mirasola and Ben Kueter. Mirasola opened the rush against the larger Kueter, moving him backwards throughout the first minute.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola hooked Kueter\u2019s leg with a minute left in the first, but Kueter wrapped his arms around Mirasola to eventually break the danger with a stalemate call.</p>\n                <p>Kueter escaped 21 seconds into Round 2 and received a stall call while Mirasola tired him out in a heavy tie up. Kueter picked the ankle but couldn\u2019t control Mirasola, allowing him to unjam his foot and roll to his back for the takedown. Kueter escaped with three seconds on the clock and the bout entered the final frame, 3-2.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola escaped to extend the lead to 4-2, leaving Kueter about 90 seconds to attempt a takedown. Mirasola wouldn\u2019t let Kueter get close, drawing a stall call, but retained the lead and secured the 4-3 decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 32, Iowa 3</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will hit the road to Evanston, Illinois, to face Northwestern at 3 p.m. Sunday.</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>An upset loss in overtime to Mercyhurst lingered in the mind of No. 4 Penn State as it traveled north to New York for a series against Syracuse.</p>\n                <p>With focus shifted to the task at hand, the Nittany Lions looked to get back on a winning streak as the back half of the season quickly approached. In a tightly contested game, Penn State used its high-powered offense to beat the Orange 4-1.</p>\n                <p>It was Maddy Campbell who got the nod against a surging Orange offense, which is fresh off a five-goal weekend. The freshman made her fourth-straight start in the absence of Katie DeSa.</p>\n                <p>The Orange looked as though it tightened things up defensively through the first 10 minutes. With the last matchup between both teams ending in an 11\u20132 victory for Penn State, Syracuse made obvious adjustments to slow down the Nittany Lions' forecheck.</p>\n                <p>The adjusted defense couldn\u2019t hold Penn State\u2019s offense for the entire duration of the opening period as Grace Outwater forced a turnover on the boards in the offensive zone. The Picton, Ontario, native snapped a quick shot from the faceoff circle that beat Ava Drabyk\u2019s glove.</p>\n                <p>With this goal, Outwater leads the AHA in goals with 14 on the season.</p>\n                <p>A full first 20 minutes seemingly controlled by Penn State came to a close as the Nittany Lions held the puck on the boards in the offensive zone.</p>\n                <p>It only took Mya Vaslet 20 seconds into the second period to open the scoring as she ripped a slapshot in close on Drabyk. With a look of shock on her face as she skated to the bench, this was the Stittsville, Ontario, native\u2019s third goal on the season, after scoring only once last season.</p>\n                <p>Pressure continued to develop from the Nittany Lions as Tessa Janecke found herself alone with Drabyk as she skated in close, ultimately missing the net on the backhand.</p>\n                <p>Momentum from both teams quickly picked up in the first five minutes as the fast play led to a Nicole Hall cross-checking penalty as she crashed into the boards. However, the Penn State penalty kill unit stood tall.</p>\n                <p>After an unsuccessful power play, a quick two-on-one opportunity developed behind the Penn State defense as Rylee McLeod fed Heidi Knoll a smooth pass under the defenseman's stick that found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>The opening first 10 minutes of the middle frame consisted of scoring chances seen on both sides of the ice, which seemed to slow down as time bled off the clock. Outwater nearly scored her second of the game as she was in close on Drabyk, ultimately having her wrist shot attempt shut down.</p>\n                <p>A much different second period concluded with Penn State having possession as time ran out, leaving the score at 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Syracuse had the first quality chance in the third period as Jordan Blouin had a chance backdoor to put one behind Campbell, ultimately denied by the left pad.</p>\n                <p>The freshman made 13 saves in her sixth career start.</p>\n                <p>The insurance goal for Penn State came off the stick of Kendall Butze as she sent a wrist shot from the top of the faceoff circle that found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>A late power play paired with an empty net posed a challenge for Penn State as the game reached its three-minute mark.</p>\n                <p>Janecke didn\u2019t take long to step up to the challenge as she sent the puck down from center ice, slowly reaching the vacant net.</p>\n                <p>Campbell spent the remaining two minutes of the game fending off any chance the Orange could generate, continuing to show promise in place of DeSa.</p>\n                <p>Penn State found itself back on track with a 4-1 score as the horn sounded.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Both teams return to Tennity Ice Pavilion for Game 2 of the final series between the two sides with puck drop at 3 p.m.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Katie DeSa was not listed on the lineup for the fourth-straight game with an undisclosed injury.

By the time she reached high school, her heart was set on becoming a Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>But her journey hasn\u2019t been without sacrifice.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAny sport or commitment you pour so much into can get really tiring,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hours, and they definitely pay off, but especially during nationals season, it can be tough.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Beyond their regular football season commitments, the Lionettes prepare for their biggest annual challenge, the Universal Dance Association National Championships (UDA Nationals). In 2024, the Lionettes placed third in the Division 1A pom category.</p>\n                <p>Each January, the team travels to Florida to compete against the nation\u2019s top collegiate dance teams \u2014 a feat made more difficult this year after Penn State cut the Lionettes\u2019 funding, leaving the team to raise tens of thousands of dollars themselves to fund their trip to UDA Nationals, which will kick off on Friday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy teammates and I were deeply disappointed and also a little frustrated by the situation,\" O\u2019Shea said. \"We don\u2019t ask for much, so it was tough to learn that our dance \u2018Super Bowl\u2019 would have to be financed entirely through our own fundraising efforts.\"</p>\n                <p>After the Lionettes spoke out about the challenge they were facing, the team received more support than they anticipated.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe Penn State community\u2019s response has been overwhelming. I never expected to receive such an outpouring of love and support from students, community members, alumni and donors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had no idea how many silent supporters were cheering us on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As college dancers, the Lionettes team has only one major competition each year and two minutes on stage for each style of dance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat makes every moment, every sacrifice and every dollar matter,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.</p>\n                <p>For as long as O\u2019Shea can remember, she\u2019s dreamed of performing on the national stage. With the financial challenges the team has faced, she said this year\u2019s competition has become even more special.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe dedicate hundreds of hours of practice to our season so that we can step onto that stage with confidence and represent Penn State with heart and pride,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cBeing able to bring that passion to life on the UDA stage and share it with the world is our ultimate goal.\u201d</p>\n                <p>O\u2019Shea's teammates and coach see her not only as a dancer but as a leader. Nikki Romano, co-captain of the Lionettes, describes the team as \u201cdedicated, passionate and hardworking,\u201d and said O\u2019Shea embodies those qualities.</p>\n                <p>Lionettes head coach Jackie Hovis also spoke highly of her leadership.</p>\n                <p>\u201cUnderclassmen look up to her when she teaches something, and she\u2019s a great example. She really shines when it comes to details.

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Following a 24-point loss to No.14 Ohio State on Wednesday night, Penn State women\u2019s basketball has now lost its last seven games and is still in search of a Big Ten win. It\u2019s been a tough stretch for the Lady Lions as they\u2019ve faced four ranked opponents, along with one receiving votes, during this skid.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white\u2019s next competitor looks a little different. Penn State welcomes Rutgers, which is also winless in conference play, to Rec Hall at 1 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Aside from the fact that someone will get their first Big Ten win of the season, there\u2019s another story to look out for in Sunday's matinee. It\u2019ll be Penn State\u2019s star guard Kiyomi McMiller\u2019s first game against her former team.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions allow more points per game than any other team in the Big Ten, at 82.4. Having said that, the Scarlet Knights have the conference\u2019s lowest points per game average at 58.6. Penn State averages 75.9 points, about 13 more than Rutgers typically allows.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s leading scorer is 6-foot-6 center Gracie Merkle, who\u2019s coming off back-to-back 20-plus point games. The Mount Washington, Kentucky native averages 19.2 points per game and owns a nation leading 75.5% field-goal percentage.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights\u2019 go-to also comes from the front court through 6-foot-1 forward Nene Ndiaye. The junior Boston College transfer averages 14.7 points per game, but does a little bit of everything for Rutgers. Ndiaye also leads the team in steals, is second in three-point shooting and rebounding, and third in assists.</p>\n                <p>Given Ndiaye\u2019s versatility, rather than Merkle, a better comparison to her on Penn State\u2019s squad is the former Scarlet Knight McMiller.</p>\n                <p>The 5-foot-8 sophomore is the Lady Lions\u2019 second leading scorer at 18.9 points per game. In the blue and white\u2019s last outing against Ohio State, McMiller scored 20 points, while also tallying seven assists and four rebounds.</p>\n                <p>McMiller leads Penn State in assists and is second on the team in steals and rebounds, but the Silver Spring, Maryland, native also turned the ball over 82 times, which is the most in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>McMiller has to match veteran guards Faith Blackstone and Kaylah Ivey, who weren\u2019t there for McMiller\u2019s lone year at Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>Blackstone averages 10 points per game, but has only made 11 appearances for the Scarlet Knights this season. Ivey averages eight points per game, but has a much bigger presence on the floor.</p>\n                <p>Ivey transferred from Boston College with Ndiaye and has been Rutgers\u2019 number one passer. The 5-foot-8 graduate student leads the Scarlet Knights with 61 assists and averages 8 points per game. Ivey also got things done on the defensive end with 23 steals on the season.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions\u2019 scoring trio rounds out with 5-foot-8 guard Moriah Murray, who averages 10.6 points per game. The junior was Penn State\u2019s leading scorer on Wednesday night with 25 points, and she shot 8-for-17 from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>In Sunday's matchup, the blue and white will have an opportunity to snap its seven-game skid, defend its home floor and finally break through in conference play. The Lady Lions have a chance to regain momentum and reset the trajectory of their season, but it won\u2019t be easy because Rutgers has the same goal.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State has its most anticipated matchup of the season on Friday, as the Nittany Lions will hit the road to face Iowa at Carver-Hawkeye Arena. This was the location that the squad last lost at back in 2020.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is trying to continue its historic win streak, but will have a few matches that are looked at as an uphill battle.</p>\n                <p>A pair of wrestlers met with the media on Wednesday and offered insight ahead of the dual.</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl</p>\n                <p>At 125 pounds, Luke Lilledahl will face Dean Peterson. Last season, Lilledahl lost to Peterson, 4-1, when Peterson was at Rutgers before transferring to Iowa.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI would say there\u2019s definitely a couple things that I learned just feeling guys out and wrestling, but most of the time it's a clean slate every match,\u201d Lilledahl said. \u201cEvery match starts 0-0, so just another opportunity.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl has the opportunity to defeat an opponent that he\u2019s never had his arm raised against. The sophomore discussed his new mindset going into the match.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like last season was kind of more about showing people my potential just because people had a lot of high expectations for me,\u201d Lilledahl said. \u201cThis year I feel like it\u2019s more like just going out there and dominating these days and kind of putting myself at the top of the weight class.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl has a solid start with a record of 9-0 so far this season.</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola</p>\n                <p>Another match to watch for Penn State is at heavyweight. Cole Mirasola will take on Ben Kueter, who like Mirasola, is also considered a smaller heavyweight. Going into this match Mirasola is on a win streak and will try to upset a top-five wrestler.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get better every match and get ready for Big Tens and nationals,\u201d Mirasola said.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola went 1-2 in Big Ten duals last season with losses coming to Nick Feldman of Ohio State and Luke Luffman of Illinois. The redshirt freshman is another wrestler that seems to have a different mindset than last season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like in the past I haven\u2019t really been like super mean when I wrestle, just kind of tactical and slick, but just talking to coach Cael (Sanderson) you always have to be clean,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cYou can win dirty, like not being dirty, like winning off a go behind or pulling guys down and stuff, focusing on being neat.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Being a smaller heavyweight, Mirasola has to use other skills to take advantage of his opponent. This includes quickness and being technical about when they\u2019re going for the takedown.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can really wrestle me for the whole seven minutes. So, if I use my conditioning as a factor, I think that\u2019ll help for sure,\u201d Mirasola said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Bryce Jordan Center (BJC) was awash with purple light on Thursday evening as members of the Penn State and State College communities came together to attend the 51st annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. memorial banquet.</p>\n                <p>The banquet, which was hosted by the Forum On Black Affairs (FOBA), is one of several January events meant to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his legacy.</p>\n                <p>Stephanie Preston, MLK banquet chair and former FOBA president, said she has had a long history of both attending, and later organizing, the banquet.</p>\n                <p>She said the event\u2019s theme of \u201cundaunted hope\u201d was chosen by the MLK Commemoration Student Committee, which FOBA then adopted.</p>\n                <p>Preston said the biggest challenge the banquet faced has been finding a large enough space to hold the event. Previously, former FOBA President Carlos Wiley moved the banquet from the Penn Stater to the BJC.</p>\n                <p>The banquet began at 6:10 p.m. with a call to order from Preston followed by speeches from Executive Vice President and Provost Fotis Sotiropoulos, Paul Robeson Cultural Center Director Evan Williams and Dean of J. Jeffrey and Ann Marie Fox Graduate School and Vice Provost for Graduate Education Levon Esters.</p>\n                <p>A blessing was given by Gary Abdullah, the assistant dean for diversity and inclusion for the Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications, followed by performances from the Essence of Joy choral ensemble and spoken word artivist Sir Dominique Jordan.</p>\n                <p>Williams, a member of FOBA, said he was pleased to see the banquet occur once again. He said he hoped attendees of the banquet left with a sense of need to come together to settle differences amongst themselves.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSometimes we have to crawl before we can walk and we're going to have our differences but oftentimes we have to understand the similarities and allow that to be at the forefront,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe may not agree on certain things, but we can agree to disagree respectfully and I think, in this current climate that we are in, this program and the messages that will be spoken tonight will be able to have a billowing effect of positivity and help make a paradigm shift in the right path that we need to go as a community.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kenyatta Shelton-Burleigh, the assistant director for the admissions strategic partnerships office in undergraduate admissions, said the banquet has been a staple of her time at Penn State and she always makes an effort to attend.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe still, as Americans, have a job to do to keep the fight going for equality, and being here at Penn State, what I love is that in the light of everything that's going on in today's world, Penn State is still standing strong on being equitable,\u201d Shelton-Burleigh said.</p>\n                <p>Preston and Williams announced Jamie Campbell as the recipient of the Humanitarian Service Award and Gyasi Franklin, a second-year studying film production, and Deja Workman, a PhD student studying informatics, the recipients of Fannie Lou Hamer \u2013 W.E.B. DuBois Service Scholarships.</p>\n                <p>The banquet concluded at 8:15 p.m. following a final performance by the United Christian Campus Ministry Choir and closing remarks from Preston.</p>\n                <p>Gopal Balachandran, a member of the State College Borough Council, said it was \u201cfantastic\u201d that the speakers and performers selected for the banquet were able to contribute to the event\u2019s theme.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe fact of the matter is that all of the speakers and all of the stories building around this theme, particularly in a part where many of the speakers acknowledge how hard it's been in the past year,\u201d Balachandran said. \u201cTo be able to give a message that is consistent with Dr. Martin Luther King but is both uplifting and full of hope, but doesn't lose sight of the fact of how much work and how much fighting still needs to be done, so I thought it was a great message for a great time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said he hoped the banquet would leave attendees hopeful for solutions to overcome current issues in American society and around the world.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're living in a difficult time,\u201d Balachandran said. \u201cThere are a great deal of challenges and stresses all around and what is really hopeful to me is that these are struggles that have occurred many times in our shared history and that there's still a way and a path forward and that we can still do that with our heads raised high and open our hearts.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lexi Cannan | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>There\u2019s something about the new year that makes it feel like everyone suddenly needs to get their life together.</p>\n                <p>All at once, it\u2019s new routines, new goals and trying to become the \u201cbest version\u201d of yourself \u2014 even though most people are still just getting back into the semester and double-checking where their classes are.</p>\n                <p>A glow-up doesn\u2019t have to be extreme. You don\u2019t need a crazy early alarm or some perfect system to change your life. Usually, it\u2019s just small things that make everyday college life feel easier.</p>\n                <p>Start small with your routine</p>\n                <p>One of the easiest places to start is your routine. You don\u2019t have to overhaul your entire schedule \u2014 just start small. Trying to change everything at once usually doesn\u2019t stick, especially once classes get busy.</p>\n                <p>Going to bed earlier, eating something before your first class or finally using an alarm you won\u2019t snooze ten times can make your day feel way less chaotic. Even one of those changes helps you feel a little more on top of things.</p>\n                <p>Clean up your space (even a little)</p>\n                <p>When your room is a mess, everything feels harder \u2014 papers on your desk, cups you forgot about, clothes on the floor that have been there way too long \u2014 it adds up fast.</p>\n                <p>You don\u2019t need to clean your whole room. Clean off your desk, your backpack or even your phone if you\u2019re feeling productive. It doesn\u2019t fix everything, but it helps your space feel less chaotic.</p>\n                <p>Movement that actually feels doable</p>\n                <p>Being active doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. You don\u2019t need hard workouts or gym motivation. Some days it\u2019s just walking to class, stretching a little or pacing around your room.</p>\n                <p>Going with a friend helps too. Trying classes together or just meeting up makes it feel more like hanging out than working out.</p>\n                <p>You can complain the whole time, laugh about not knowing what you\u2019re doing and leave early if you want. It just feels like a break from sitting around all day, which is kind of the point.</p>\n                <p>Rethink the way you choose your daily outfits</p>\n                <p>Let\u2019s be honest \u2014 most of us wear the same few outfits every week. A glow-up doesn\u2019t mean changing that, it just means liking those outfits.</p>\n                <p>A good hoodie, jeans that don\u2019t feel awful and sneakers that go with everything can make even low-effort days feel better.</p>\n                <p>When you actually feel comfortable in what you\u2019re wearing, you\u2019re not constantly thinking about it throughout the day. You can actually focus on class, run errands or just get through a long day on campus.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not about looking dressed up \u2014 it\u2019s about feeling like yourself, even on days when you\u2019re putting in the bare minimum.</p>\n                <p>Take your mental health seriously</p>\n                <p>The beginning of second semester is rough. It gets dark early, everyone\u2019s tired and it feels like there\u2019s always something you should be doing.</p>\n                <p>Taking care of your mental health sometimes just means stopping for a second. Skipping plans, logging off or even sitting in your room doing nothing without turning it into a whole guilt spiral. You don\u2019t have to push through everything.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s okay to slow down when things feel overwhelming. A glow-up isn\u2019t just about looks \u2014 it\u2019s taking care of yourself when you need to. Instead of big goals, think about how you want to feel this year. Less stressed, more balanced or just better overall.</p>\n                <p>Focus on how you want to feel</p>\n                <p>Instead of putting pressure on yourself with big resolutions, it helps to think about how you want to feel this year. Maybe that\u2019s more balanced, less stressed or more confident.</p>\n                <p>Let whatever habits you pick support that instead of making your life harder. You don\u2019t need to do everything \u201cright\u201d or have it all figured out \u2014 just do what actually works for you and your schedule.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

Me too.</p>\n                <p>I really thought last season would\u2019 have been the one where we secured a BIG 10 Championship. (But hey, at least Ohio State lost).</p>\n                <p>Sitting in class during a beautiful day</p>\n                <p>I am sure we\u2019re all aware of just how little sunshine State College gets this time of year.</p>\n                <p>There is absolutely nothing comparable to seeing the first sunny day in the spring after a long, cold, brutal winter and having mandatory classes to attend \u2014 keeping you inside all day.</p>\n                <p>Getting Pollock freshman year</p>\n                <p>Name a worse experience than finding out you\u2019ve been placed in Pollock for the year \u2014 you can\u2019t. While the year there can turn into a great time, going into the space with little information other than the horror stories is certainly a fright.</p>\n                <p>Yes, the location is better than East Halls, but there\u2019s no other positives to be found amongst the bats and cockroaches.</p>\n                <p>Having class the Monday after THON weekend</p>\n                <p>If only professors could express some sympathy for the fact that the majority of students have not slept for hours, whilst supporting an incredible cause of fundraising, and standing for 46 hours consecutively.</p>\n                <p>The Monday after THON Weekend should be an official Penn State holiday.</p>\n                <p>Running out of meal plan freshman year</p>\n                <p>With no kitchen, no way of getting to the grocery store, low funds and places to get food \u2014 except downtown Target, which is always practically ransacked \u2014 you essentially have no other option but to try and tough it out or to reload money into your meal plan account.</p>\n                <p>The Philadelphia Eagles</p>\n                <p>Growing up, we endured the Eagles at their worst; however, now a loss hurts so much more when your team is objectively considered \u201cgood.\u201d</p>\n                <p>There was a time fans would have been excited if we won any game period.</p>\n                <p>The reigning Super Bowl champions losing in the wild-card round this season is a major letdown to say the least.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately, the defense can only do so much with a lack of effective offensive plays and playcalling.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe Freshman 15\u201d</p>\n                <p>Before even beginning college, I am sure everyone was warned about the dreaded 15-pound weight gain following the start of a collegiate lifestyle.</p>\n                <p>With an increase in academic stressors raising your cortisol levels, unhealthy dining hall foods instead of healthier home-cooked meals, binge drinking and the lack of a consistent sleep and exercise schedule are huge contributors to this cultural phenomenon.</p>\n                <p>Adjusting to a completely new place you are now calling home and feeling uncomfortable in your own skin are not pleasant experiences, but unfortunately they tend to go hand in hand.</p>\n                <p>Graduation looming</p>\n                <p>The real world sucks. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t know I\u2019m still in college.</p>\n                <p>Basically, a dark cloud looms over your head the second you become an upperclassman.

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Now in the midst of a four-game losing streak, Penn State fell to 9-8 on the year and 0-6 in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are one game ahead of Northwestern and two games ahead of Maryland, both of which are also winless in conference play. All three sit tied for last in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Oregon\u2019s 1-5 Big Ten record is the only thing keeping it above the blue and white in the standings, as the Ducks sit at 8-9 overall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State heads about 200 miles south on Sunday to take on the Terrapins at the XFINITY Center. Tipoff is scheduled for noon.</p>\n                <p>Something\u2019s gotta give come Sunday as Maryland\u2019s also dropped its last four-in-a-row. The Terrapins suffered quality losses against Virginia, Michigan, Alabama and Gonzaga. Three of four of those losses were blowouts, however.</p>\n                <p>Maryland\u2019s leading scorer, Pharrel Payne, hasn\u2019t played since the Terrapins\u2019 Dec. 13 game against Michigan. He enters as questionable with a leg injury. Payne averaged 17.5 points and 7.2 rebounds per game when available.</p>\n                <p>The injury bug is going around, though, as Penn State also arrives in College Park without some of its key players.</p>\n                <p>Nittany Lion standout freshman Kayden Mingo sustained a broken nose in practice and will \u201cbe out for a while,\u201d and Tibor Mirti\u010d also enters questionable, with a knee injury that he\u2019s \u201cjust rehabbing,\u201d as both described by Mike Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>In Penn State\u2019s most recent loss to UCLA, Freddie Dilione V sustained an ankle injury and is questionable against Maryland, though he\u2019ll most likely be sidelined, as Rhoades detailed it was a sprain.</p>\n                <p>With Payne\u2019s injury, Maryland\u2019s points leader is David \u201cDiggy\u201d Coit, who averages 13.8 points per game. The 5-foot-11 guard enters fresh off a 30 point performance in the Terrapins\u2019 recent loss to USC.</p>\n                <p>That was his third 30-plus point performance of the season. He dropped 41 against Mount St. Mary back in November.</p>\n                <p>Despite Mingo\u2019s injury sidelining him for the last three games, he still leads Penn State in scoring, behind his 14.9 points per game average as a freshman. With Dilione V likely being out against Maryland, the blue and white\u2019s leading scorer against the Terrapins will be Melih Tunca.</p>\n                <p>Tunca averages 10.1 points per game and only recorded five points in the loss to UCLA.</p>\n                <p>Dominick Stewart led the way against the Bruins, dropping 16 points \u2013 the most of any Nittany Lion. He likely sees a tremendous amount of playing time against Maryland as one of just three healthy guards.</p>\n                <p>Penn State averages 78.1 points per game as a team, while the Terrapins average 73.2, though the Nittany Lions' defense surrenders 75.4 points per game.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white is 4-8 in games when it allows opponents to score 70-plus points. Maryland has been stopped short of 70-plus points in just six games this season.</p>\n                <p>Prior to the 2025-26 season, the Big Ten announced that all 18 teams would make the conference tournament after the regular season, up from 15. Despite that, this still feels like a must-win game for both teams, as each is desperate for its first conference win.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Julia Frederick | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>To my fellow spring 2026 graduates, welcome to your last semester of undergrad.</p>\n                <p>If you\u2019re anything like me, the thought of graduation has always seemed like this far-off, almost make-believe thing. It\u2019ll happen eventually, but not for a while.</p>\n                <p>Well, a few years have sprinted by and now you\u2019re getting emails from your academic advisor to apply for graduation on LionPATH, pressure from your mom to order your cap and gown and crossing your fingers that your family found a place to stay come May.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Spring 2026 holds a lot of lasts. Last first day of class. Last night out at the bar with your friends. Last moment before you enter the big, scary \u201creal world.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The finish line is approaching rapidly. Are you ready?</p>\n                <p>If you aren\u2019t, you\u2019re certainly not alone. Big transitions like this carry a lot of emotion. You might feel excited, scared, uncertain or all of the above.</p>\n                <p>However you\u2019re feeling, allow me to share some advice that I\u2019ve found to be helpful.</p>\n                <p>Tip 1: This is not the first big change you\u2019ve faced</p>\n                <p>\u201cAnticipatory anxiety\u201d is something that can surface as graduation approaches, according to the American Psychological Association (APA).</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. It\u2019s \u201cworry about the future\u201d and \u201cthe fear that bad things might happen or that you might become unable to successfully accomplish what you set out to do,\u201d as the Anxiety and Depression Association of America defines it.</p>\n                <p>The APA points to looking at one\u2019s history to alleviate these feelings.</p>\n                <p>Thus, I encourage you to think back to graduating high school all those years ago. Remember the feeling of being freshly 18 with the world at your fingertips and the uncertainty of what was in store for you.</p>\n                <p>Remember the drive to University Park and the teary family goodbyes. Remember your first-year dorm, roommate and classes. Remember your first lecture hall in the Forum or Thomas, thinking to yourself, \u201cHow can there be so many people here?\u201d</p>\n                <p>It all felt so overwhelming at the time, didn\u2019t it?</p>\n                <p>Look at you now. You came out the other side. You not only did the hard thing, but you thrived while doing so.</p>\n                <p>It all worked out then; there\u2019s no reason to doubt that it will now, too.</p>\n                <p>Tip 2: You\u2019re not the first and you won\u2019t be the last</p>\n                <p>Penn State has over 800,000 alumni. That means that over 800,000 people have gone through the exact same thing. All of this goes to say that you aren\u2019t alone.</p>\n                <p>While of course, graduation may be bittersweet, you\u2019ll join something bigger than yourself and the current campus population. Penn State has one of the largest alumni networks in the U.S.; you\u2019re in good company.</p>\n                <p>While your time as a student at Penn State may be over, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never come back. Happy Valley has a way of welcoming past-students back home.</p>\n                <p>You took great care of Penn State while you were here, it\u2019s time to pass it on to the next incoming class.</p>\n                <p>Tip 3: Make the most of it</p>\n                <p>To bring in one of my 2026 New Year\u2019s resolutions, say yes to as much as you can (within reason, of course).</p>\n                <p>Do that bar crawl, see that movie, stay out late. Do everything you wanted to do when you came here, plus a few extra things.</p>\n                <p>Graduate with no regrets \u2026 OK, maybe a few (WITHIN REASON).</p>\n                <p>Leave with college years well-lived, whatever that means to you. Be proud of where you came from, but keep moving forward. Penn State will always cheer you on.</p>\n                <p>You\u2019re off to your next big adventure. Congratulations on what you\u2019ve accomplished.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State kept its winning streak alive with its third straight win of the 2026 season on Thursday. It swept St. Thomas Aquinas 3-0, taking home another victory from Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>The first set started with back-and-forth scoring from both sides. For every point scored by the Nittany Lions, the Spartans responded immediately, keeping the first few points close.</p>\n                <p>After keeping the set neck-and-neck, the blue and white finally pulled away with a block from Sean Harvey, making the score 11-8.</p>\n                <p>But St. Thomas Aquinas was able to get it close again after a few blocks and quick points, diminishing the blue and white\u2019s lead to 11-10.</p>\n                <p>After a big kill from Penn State\u2019s Gaige Gabriel, the blue and white started to pull ahead, making its lead 13-10. The 6-foot-8 sophomore then went on to deliver an ace, increasing the blue and white\u2019s lead to 14-10.</p>\n                <p>A kill from Penn State\u2019s Owen Rose tallied its third point in a row, forcing the Spartans to take their first timeout of the match. Following the break, the Spartans were able to score three quick points and tighten the game back up.</p>\n                <p>After a play being challenged by the blue and white, however, it continued to pull away, setting the score at 18-13.</p>\n                <p>After some brief back-and-forth, a service error from the Spartans made the score 25-19, giving Penn State a win in the first set.</p>\n                <p>Going into the second set, the pattern seemed to continue, with the first few points being back-and-forth on both sides of the court.</p>\n                <p>However, after two big kills, one from Gabriel and another from Matthew Luoma, the blue and white pulled ahead, making the score 8-5.</p>\n                <p>However, after a few errors on the Penn State side, the Spartans were able to close the lead to 11-10. And just like that, it was back-and-forth scoring, with the score staying within two points for the next few points.</p>\n                <p>After a kill from Harvey, the Nittany Lions took the lead by three points, making the score 19-16. But the Spartans were quick to respond and close that gap. But it was Harvey again who got another big kill and put the blue and white back up.</p>\n                <p>Rose\u2019s sixth kill of the game put the Nittany Lions up 22-18. From there, the rest was history. A kill from Luoma got Penn State the win in the second set, 25-20.</p>\n                <p>The third set started with two quick points from St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was quick to respond, however, and went on a five-point streak. After a kill from Gabriel, back-to-back aces from Harvey, a Spartans\u2019 block error and a kill from Harvey, it took the lead 5-2.</p>\n                <p>After some back-and-forth, redshirt freshman Jaidyn Bethel logged his second kill of the match to make the score 10-6. From there, the blue and white seemed to run away with it a bit, as Gabriel logged his ninth kill, making the score 13-7.</p>\n                <p>After another Harvey kill, his ninth of the night, Penn State increased its lead to 16-7, leading by more than double.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took the remainder of the set with ease. Freshman Tristan Hassell logged his first kill of the match to make the score 22-12.</p>\n                <p>While they managed to score a few more points in the set, the lead was too great for the Spartans to close. The blue and white won its third straight set after a service error from the opposite side of the court.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will continue their homestand as they face Lewis at 7 p.m. Saturday in Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Last January, Penn State put an end to its nine-game conference winless streak after a 3-0 shutout over Notre Dame. The win acted as a catalyst for the Nittany Lions\u2019 red-hot second-half, going 13-3 to round out the regular season.</p>\n                <p>This January, the Fighting Irish are back for their first series of the season with the blue and white, set for a 7 p.m. puck drop on Friday and 8 p.m. puck drop on Saturday, both at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Notre Dame\u2019s struggles</p>\n                <p>Notre Dame has had a tough year and is currently in the midst of a seven-game losing streak. With an overall record of 4-15-1, the Fighting Irish are winless in conference play and sit at the bottom of the Big Ten standings.</p>\n                <p>Notre Dame\u2019s averages of 2.55 goals per game and 4.25 goals allowed both rank last in the Big Ten; however, its special teams have performed well, with a conference-third-best power-play percentage and a second-best penalty kill percentage.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Irish are led by defenseman Paul Fischer, who has five goals and 11 assists on the season, but the junior will miss out on this weekend\u2019s action after being assessed a suspension for a checking penalty in last weekend\u2019s contest.</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and Notre Dame sit at No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, in the NCAA in penalty minutes per game, setting up a likely physical series.</p>\n                <p>In net for the Fighting Irish is sophomore Nicholas Kempf, who recently wrapped up a World Junior Championship campaign with Team USA. The Washington Capitals prospect has an .887 save percentage on the season, while allowing 65 goals.</p>\n                <p>Penn State injuries loom</p>\n                <p>While the addition of both Aiden Fink and Cade Christenson back into the Penn State lineup after the holiday break has been an added boost, the home team sustained multiple injuries after last weekend\u2019s sweep of Minnesota, which could impact the upcoming series.</p>\n                <p>Shortly after recording his first goal of the season in the Nittany Lions\u2019 5-2 win over Minnesota on Saturday, sophomore Braedon Ford collided awkwardly with the boards and left the ice in visible pain.</p>\n                <p>Coach Guy Gadowsky announced the forward would be \u201cout for a significant amount of time with a lower-body injury.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A big question mark for this weekend is the status of the blue and white\u2019s point leader, Charlie Cerrato, after he exited Friday\u2019s contest early and was scratched the following night.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky announced Cerrato, along with Casey Aman and Shea Van Olm, are all \u201cday-to-day,\u201d leaving open the possibility of the three returning to the lineup, although the likelihood is unclear.</p>\n                <p>Goaltending tandem</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have stuck with its rotational strategy of alternating goaltenders Josh Fleming and Kevin Reidler. The strategy has largely worked out, with both having solid seasons, keeping the option open for either of them to compete on a given night.</p>\n                <p>Fleming holds the slight edge over Reidler, although with two fewer appearances, tallying a 93.8 save percentage to Reidler\u2019s 91.1.</p>\n                <p>Fleming is impressing in the midst of his freshman season, recently being named to the Mike Richter Award watch list, an award given annually to the top goaltender in NCAA men\u2019s Division I hockey. His save percentage is tied for first nationally, and his 1.91 goals against average is tied for seventh.</p>\n                <p>Reidler is also in his first season with the Nittany Lions, transferring in after spending his first season with Nebraska Omaha, and has helped the team to 11 wins so far through the season.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Veronica Figg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A new spot for stir-frys, salads and honey-based desserts recently opened it\u2019s doors in State College. The Philadelphia-based restaurant chain Honeygrow is now located at 160 E Beaver Ave from 10:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.</p>\n                <p>This week, I decided to go and try some of the new spot\u2019s options, and to find a dish that might \u201cwok\u201d your world.</p>\n                <p>Stir-Fry</p>\n                <p>I chose to order Honeygrow\u2019s seasonal Miso Garlic stir-fry noodles. The dish includes egg white noodles, roasted chicken, miso corn, caramelized onions, shaved parmesan, chives and Umami miso sauce. I chose to remove the shaved parmesan.</p>\n                <p>The dish was very good and had a great Umami profile. The noodles were cooked perfectly \u2014 not too soft or soggy from the sauce.</p>\n                <p>The chicken was juicy and was not dry at all. The Umami profile came into play when the sauce mixed with the individual flavors of the chicken, corn and onions, making them a powerful combination.</p>\n                <p>The caramelized onions were tangy and crunchy, giving a needed sharpness to the sweet corn. The noodles, corn and onions together created a rich, tangy and sweet balance that \u2014 when mixed with the chicken \u2014 created the Umami flavor the dish strives for, tasting savory and comforting.</p>\n                <p>The chives were sprinkled on top and I mixed them in to add to the flavor profile. Unfortunately, the taste of the chives was overpowered by the garlic in the sauce.</p>\n                <p>I would have liked to have tasted the chives more clearly so they could have added some more tang to the dish.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Dessert</p>\n                <p>I ordered a create-your-own Honeybar for dessert, and chose clover honey, apples, grapes, blueberries, strawberries and granola as my toppings.</p>\n                <p>This dessert was delicious. I ate the whole thing and would really recommend it.</p>\n                <p>Clover honey is sweet and was the highlight of the dessert. It made the multiple flavors of the fruits really pop.</p>\n                <p>The granola was crunchy and a great juxtaposition for the sweetness of the strawberries and tanginess of the blueberries, making for a great flavor combination.</p>\n                <p>The grapes were a great addition to the dessert that added a unique flavor which complimented the other fruits.</p>\n                <p>The apples were crunchy and sweet, and \u2014 when paired with the grapes \u2014 went great with the honey. All of the fruits tasted fresh and no part of the dessert was dry.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 10/10</p>\n                <p>Veronica\u2019s Food Sensitivity Corner</p>\n                <p>As a student who was recently diagnosed with a dairy sensitivity, I am always on the lookout for foods that fit my new dietary needs and am aware there are other students who may have similar needs as well.</p>\n                <p>Honeygrow does offer vegan dishes like the Red Coconut Curry Stir-Fry, or Gluten-free items on their menu including the Loaded Greek Salad and OG Cobb Salad.</p>\n                <p>At Honeygrow, all dishes on the menu can be modified to remove ingredients, and you can also create your own stir-fry, salad or honeybar and customize it.</p>\n                <p>As with any food establishment, please inform a service worker if you have any food allergies.</p>\n                <p>Overall, I would recommend Honeygrow to anyone who misses a home-cooked meal of the noodle variety, and for any student that needs a sweet treat after a long day of classes.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>It\u2019s a random Wednesday during the frigid January winter in Happy Valley. You step out of your class building and get hit with a gust of wind to the face followed by a trek through the flurry of snow to the library under an endlessly grey sky.</p>\n                <p>The sun becomes a celebrity \u2014 making rare and treasured appearances. In times like these, it\u2019s best to put on some headphones, crank up some music and escape the seasonal depression for a few brief minutes.</p>\n                <p>Here are some tunes to play to get you through the day and put a little more pep in your step as you hunker through the winter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLike A Rolling Stone\u201d by Bob Dylan</p>\n                <p>Arguably Dylan\u2019s biggest hit of his career, \u201cLike A Rolling Stone\u201d is a bitter sweet story about a once-rich woman who loses everything and finds herself \u2014 as Dylan would put it \u2014 rolling through life like a stone.</p>\n                <p>Sure, a bummer topic for a song, but the production, ensemble and groovy tempo of it make you want to shake into a dance no matter where you\u2019re walking. A fitting song for a gloomy mood as the juxtaposition of the lyrics and the production of the track make for a comedically ironic vibe that is sure to boost your spirits.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDrive\u201d by Incubus</p>\n                <p>Incubus\u2019 \u201cDrive\u201d is a much slower tune, but the true uplifting power comes from the lyrics. A fabulous song about regaining control of your life and finding the empowerment behind that act.</p>\n                <p>Lead singer Brandon Boyd lays a blanket of warmth over your soul as he belts out the lyrics to the chorus, \u201cwhatever tomorrow brings, I\u2019ll be there, with open arms and open eyes.\u201d Best played on the bus or car ride home after a long day, \u201cDrive\u201d will give you a comforting sense of security in yourself to keep pushing through the dreary days of winter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d by Prince</p>\n                <p>Switching tracks and putting you in a free and easy mood is the iconic opener to Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain\u201d album, \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d This killer track opens with a monologue from the eccentric lead singer, talking about \u201cthe afterworld, a world of never-ending happiness.\u201d In this world, \u201cyou can always see the sun, day or night.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The true message of this song is simply, if the world is bringing you down, just let loose and find a way to have a good time \u2014 ignore everything else and just be alive. The snow and the wind won\u2019t stand a chance to bring you down with this tune bumping between your ears.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSweater Weather\u201d by The Neighbourhood</p>\n                <p>An early 2010\u2019s hit where the music alone immediately throws you back to the wonderful winter days of elementary school, while keeping you in the present to take a moment to appreciate how many winters have passed and how you\u2019ve survived all of them.</p>\n                <p>A truly creative and embracing song on all levels that carries the vibe of a gloomy winter night to help you embrace \u2014 yes \u2014 the sweater weather. Layered on top of that is a lyrical composition that will also take your mind away from whatever it is that has you down that day, as you hear a tale of two lovers cherishing each other during a similarly rough patch.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d by The Black Eyed Peas</p>\n                <p>Rounding out this list is a pure nostalgia hit for anyone working through their years at State College. \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d is sure to remind you of the upcoming good vibes of spring and summer that lay ahead.</p>\n                <p>This 2000\u2019s radio banger exudes positivity, enthusiasm and eager excitment, with the trio preaching, \u201ctonight\u2019s gonna be a good night,\u201d and just like with Incubus\u2019 \u201cDrive,\u201d you truly feel that sense of confidence in the thought tonight will in fact be a good night, no matter the blizzards of assignments you have to go through.</p>\n                <p>Lyrics aside, the production on this track just puts you in a party mood \u2014 wanting to bust out dancing and grooving along to the fun and energetic tune. A choice pick for the mid-day grind that will hit you like a double shot of espresso between the ears.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State hits the road this Friday for an away meet, kicking off its Big Ten schedule, taking on Illinois. The Nittany Lions were in Rec Hall this past Sunday and tested the waters by testing various rotation lineups against Yale, which proved successful and resulted in a win.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions rank well entering week 2, obtaining the No. 17 spot, while the Fighting Illini hold the No. 35 spot. Illinois finished second in the Border Battle Quad Meet, coming in close to first-place, Iowa.</p>\n                <p>Penn State looks confident in its ability to secure some big points right off the bat, with a slew of well-rounded talent to play around with. Penn State brought in an arsenal of new talent this season, and it can begin to move around.</p>\n                <p>Fresh faces like Kayla Bender, who excels on the balance beam, round out some of the struggles that the blue and white saw on the event last season. Freshman Lizzy Ryan could be a great addition as an all-around competitor, adding to the capabilities of Kalea McElligot and Elizabeth Leary, who were strong all-around athletes in the 2025 season.</p>\n                <p>The floor is looking like the event that will define this Fighting Illini and Nittany Lion meet, with 2025 season scores on the floor being high on both sides. Illinois enters the Big Ten season with high 9.800 scores for multiple athletes, with some reaching that 9.900 mark. Penn State is right up there with the Fighting Illini, with most of its roster scoring a high 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Vault appears to be a weak spot for Illinois, struggling to put up 2025 season high scores above 9.7500, and the rotation wasn't as successful as it had hoped during the Border Battle Quad Meet. The Nittany Lions put a heavy focus on vault, and they managed to get a good set of numbers after their rotation on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s meet with Yale showed Dani Latronica as a possibility for multiple events, starting off strong across vault, bar and beam. Ellie Monahan and Allison Kaempfer are both great options for the Nittany Lions to cover all their bases on Friday, with Monahan scoring well on beam and floor and Kaempfer holding it down on vault and bars.</p>\n                <p>As for the Fighting Illini, Chloe Cho showed out in their quad meet, scoring over 9.800 across the board. Bars also seem to be a focus for Illinois, with multiple 9.800 and higher scores after week one.</p>\n                <p>Mareli Muller is also a strong all-around athlete for the Fighting Illini, but she was missing from competition last week. If she joins the team again on Friday, she could be a really powerful aspect of the lineup. Being a great all-around gymnast, she can really excel and be a reason for the Nittany Lions to worry.</p>\n                <p>Illinois, similar to Penn State, has great depth and new talent entering the 2026 season, especially Callie Kauffman, a freshman who was a four-time level 10 regional qualifier and proved her abilities during week one.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The collegiate women\u2019s hockey world was stunned on Saturday afternoon, when No. 4 Penn State allowed a late tally followed by an overtime goal against Mercyhurst in its first conference loss of the season.</p>\n                <p>Continuing on their seven-game road trip, the Nittany Lions embark to Tennity Ice Pavilion in Syracuse, New York, to take on the Orange at 6 p.m Friday, and 3 p.m Saturday. The blue and white enter against Syracuse with a 19-4 overall record and 13-1 in the AHA. Meanwhile, the Orange are 12-11-3 overall and 8-6-2 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Head-to-Head</p>\n                <p>The last time these two teams squared off, the puck was nearly always on a Nittany Lions\u2019 stick.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white rode the offensive wave en route to an authoritative series sweep over the Orange, kicking off with a 7-0 victory in Game 1 before its history-making 11-2 punchline in Game 2. Penn State\u2019s 11 goals tied the program record for most goals in a single game.</p>\n                <p>Syracuse currently rides a four-game winning streak after stringing together consecutive sweeps over Delaware and Robert Morris. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions endured an upset in their previous outing against Mercyhurst.</p>\n                <p>Scouting the Orange</p>\n                <p>Syracuse is a difficult team to read. While they\u2019ve faced defeat to ranked and unranked teams alike, the Orange responded with close games and even found success in the shootout against a top-5 opponent.</p>\n                <p>On Nov. 25, Syracuse went the distance with then-No. 5 Cornell. The game was deadlocked at 2-2 and ended up decided in a shootout. Heidi Knoll and Nea Tervonen converted on their attempts, while goaltender Ava Drabyk was solid in net for a 2-0 shootout victory, despite the game officially registering as a draw nationally.</p>\n                <p>This contest wasn\u2019t the first time the Orange pulled off an extended-time victory, however. Four days before beating Cornell, Knoll dealt the same blow to Mercyhurst in a shootout, as well.</p>\n                <p>Outside of the shootout, Emma Gnade paces Syracuse\u2019s offense with eight goals and seven assists. Peyton Armstrong follows closely, with 13 points this season and Jackson Kinsler rounds out the top three with 12 points.</p>\n                <p>Senior Sami Gendron leads the defensive effort with 51 blocked shots, as well as contributing a goal and five assists while maintaining a zero plus-minus rating. Sophomore Jessica Cheung ranks second with 42 blocked shots, adding seven assists.</p>\n                <p>Drabyk\u2019s set to make her 24th start of the season between the pipes. The freshman netminder shows a 10-10-3 personal record, while boasting a .931 save percentage and 2.07 goals-against average.</p>\n                <p>Potential roster changes</p>\n                <p>Currently, Penn State has two players listed as members of their respective Olympic teams for the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games: Tessa Janecke for the United States and Nicole Hall for Sweden.</p>\n                <p>With the Games approaching, Janecke and Hall, two of Penn State\u2019s top performers, could be missing out on the Nittany Lions\u2019 closing act with the Orange this season.</p>\n                <p>Starting goaltender Katie DeSa didn\u2019t appear in either game against the Lakers last weekend, possibly due to an undisclosed injury, with no clear timeline on return. Freshman Maddy Campbell stepped into the starting role and has posted a .932 save percentage coupled with a 1.40 goals-against average so far through eight games.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Annie Gleba | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 2 Penn State travels to West Point, New York, to compete in the 2026 West Point Open. The two-day event begins this Friday. The Nittany Lions opened this season with a win over Army, 311.300-297.600, at Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>This event features competitors from levels 3 to 10 events and includes athletes from Penn State, Simpson, Navy, Springfield College, Army and William &amp; Mary. The first day consists of NCAA-level team competition, while the second day will host individual event finals for the top qualifiers from Friday\u2019s competition.</p>\n                <p>Last season at the West Point Open, Penn State finished second behind Ohio State, which will not return to the competition this year, with a team score of 237.800.</p>\n                <p>Simpson College</p>\n                <p>Simpson College is a Division III program that competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Simpson established its program and began to compete in the 2022-23 season. This means the Storm has never attended the West Point Open competition. They are the only NCAA school in Iowa to sponsor men\u2019s gymnastics and one of the few DIII programs nationwide.</p>\n                <p>Last season, they placed 6th in the ECAC Championship with a score of 299.600, and their all-around season average being 292.100.</p>\n                <p>Navy</p>\n                <p>Navy won its conference championship frequently in the last decade. The Midshipmen are a powerhouse within their conference and defeated Springfield College this season. Last year in the West Point Open, they placed third with a score of 309.500.</p>\n                <p>Despite losing the conference last year, Navy posted a 5-0 record. The name to watch from the Navy is Danilo Viciana. He was elected team captain this season and participated in the NCAA Championship Event Final.</p>\n                <p>Springfield College</p>\n                <p>Springfield College finished last place during last year's competition, just narrowly behind William &amp; Mary with 300.050 points. During the first meet of this season, the Pride placed about 1.5 points under Navy, 307.650-306.100. The Pride\u2019s roster contains gymnasts who previously qualified for individual finals in recent seasons, aiming to improve on their previous standing scores.</p>\n                <p>They will lean on players like Owen Carney, who qualified for individual finals in three different events in last year\u2019s West Point Open. The senior won the high bar event and placed second on the floor.</p>\n                <p>Army</p>\n                <p>Last year, Army won its conference, dethroning Navy's previous six-year streak and its first ECAC championship since 2015. Last season, Army placed 4th in the West Point Open, just slightly behind Navy with a score of 308.300.</p>\n                <p>After their conference win, the Black Knights went on to the NCAA Championships Qualifier, where they placed 10th.</p>\n                <p>William &amp; Mary</p>\n                <p>The Griffins placed 5th in the West Point Open last year with a score of 300.450. They had four individuals advance to event finals, with all competitors placing inside the top eight. One of William &amp; Mary\u2019s top competitors is Evan Wilkins.</p>\n                <p>His floor score against Springfield ranks as the nation's 10th-best mark in 2025, as well as earning all-ECAC on the floor after tying for third.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>This Friday, Penn State faces their marquee opponent of the season so far, traveling to Carver Hawkeye Arena to face off against the Iowa Hawkeyes.</p>\n                <p>The venue is the last place the Nittany Lions lost a dual, nearly six years ago. Iowa will look to shock the world by handing the Nittany Lions another loss. However, recent controversies and some underperforming upperclassmen leave Penn State as a heavy favorite in this top-five matchup.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 2 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 6 Dean Peterson (UI)</p>\n                <p>This serves as a revenge match for Luke Lilledahl after Dean Peterson upset him, 4-1, at Rutgers last season.</p>\n                <p>Peterson is 7-1 in his senior year, but has no marquee victories under his belt to this point. This will be Lilledahl\u2019s highest-ranked matchup of the season so far.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 8 Drake Ayala (UI)</p>\n                <p>Drake Ayala is a two-time NCAA runner-up, but has taken a step back early this season with his record floating around the .500 line heading into a match with Blaze. For Blaze, this marks an opportunity to claim a victory over one of the most prestigious names in college wrestling, even during his down year.</p>\n                <p>Despite the record, Ayala is no cake walk. In the past two years, Ayala didn\u2019t drop more than five matches in a season. Blaze will have to use pure skill to outmatch the experience of Ayala.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 7 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 11 Nasir Bailey (UI)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis faces another big name talent having a relatively down year for the Hawkeyes, wrestling against former All-American and Pac-12 champion Nasir Bailey. Bailey\u2019s 9-3 record isn\u2019t bad, but he is nearing his loss total for previous years earlier in the season than usual.</p>\n                <p>For Davis, this is his biggest match since moving up to 141. Davis jumped into the top 10 immediately after returning to the lineup and will try to earn that ranking on Friday.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 17 Ryder Block (UI)</p>\n                <p>Ryder Block is in the midst of a breakout year after going 2-4 last season. Block is 6-2 in the early goings of his sophomore season but is 1-2 in ranked matches.</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness has been running through competition this season, and Block doesn\u2019t show the makings of an opponent that could upset the No. 1 at the weight class.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. No. 12 Jordan Williams (UI)</p>\n                <p>Jordan Williams is another highly touted transfer on Iowa\u2019s roster after coming in from Little Rock. He\u2019s 7-2 on the season for his new team, but is 0-2 against ranked opponents. This is the biggest matchup of the season so far for PJ Duke, going against the defending PAC-12 champion. Duke has been outscoring Williams on the year and is the favorite in this matchup.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs No. 3 Micheal Caliendo (UI)</p>\n                <p>This is a familiar matchup for both sides, as Michael Caliendo has faced Mitchell Mesenbrink six times over the last few years, with Mesenbrink winning each matchup. Each matchup has gotten closer, but it\u2019s clear Mesenbrink has Caliendo\u2019s number. This is expected to be a low-scoring affair as both wrestlers are patient and familiar with each other\u2019s styles.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs No. 3 Patrick Kennedy (UI)</p>\n                <p>Patrick Kennedy is in the midst of his most successful season in his senior year, starting out 9-1 and jumping into the top three. He is 3-1 against top-15 opponents, but Levi Haines is on a different level.</p>\n                <p>Haines is 3-0 against Kennedy in his career, with each win being decisive. Nothing has shifted to suggest this match will end much differently than those ones.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 4 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs No. 1 Angelo Ferrari (UI)</p>\n                <p>Angelo Ferrari was a highly touted prospect during his redshirt season last year. During one of his matches in the Bryce Jordan Center, Ferrari held former Nittany Lion Carter Starocci to one point. This season, his defense has defined his success, as he hasn\u2019t been taken down in a match this season. This is one of two matches where the Nittany Lion won\u2019t be the favorite.</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh has been consistent since joining the Nittany Lions, but hasn\u2019t been showing off the way Ferrari has this season. This will be a low-scoring match that may be decided by a single takedown or escape points.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. Gabe Arnold/ Harvey Ludington (UI)</p>\n                <p>With the dismissal of No. 4 Massoma Endene, there is uncertainty around who Josh Barr will face on Friday night.

I am Miss Behave and this semester I have the pleasure of exploring everything and anything about love, relationships and sex with you. And the best part? You get to send in your own stories and advice, anonymously, of course.</p>\n                <p>Think of me as your campus Cupid, if Cupid had a sharper tongue and better Wi\u2011Fi. So grab your beverage of choice and settle in, because it\u2019s time to talk about what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out as we enter our 2026 era. The popular \u201cins\u201d and \u201couts\u201d trend is the new way to set intentions, and naturally I have thoughts.</p>\n                <p>I know we\u2019re all busy bees this first week back, so let\u2019s skip the foreplay and jump right into it.</p>\n                <p>INS</p>\n                <p>Self-Respect (Membership Mandatory)</p>\n                <p>Self-respect is mandatory. Desperation is the emotional equivalent of wearing socks with sandals, stop it. Also, if someone can\u2019t meet you at your level, don\u2019t lower standards and don't you dare settle for less than you deserve. Respect yourself and know your worth.</p>\n                <p>Emotional IQ</p>\n                <p>Ladies, if you can order a Starbucks with multiple modifications, you can say what\u2019s actually going on in your head. Gentlemen, if you can rant about your favorite sports team for half an hour, you can spend a few minutes admitting you have feelings. Speak up and be honest.</p>\n                <p>Dating with Intention</p>\n                <p>We\u2019re dating like adults \u2026 calendars, expectations and actual standards included. If you want something casual, say it. If you want something real, act like it. Show up, text back like a functioning human and stop acting like effort is optional.</p>\n                <p>Modern dating isn\u2019t always cute; it can be exhausting. So stop with the games, stop with the mixed signals and for the love of all that is holy, stop chasing people who won\u2019t even meet you halfway.</p>\n                <p>A Review Board</p>\n                <p>Your friends are the jury. If your friends aren\u2019t hyping up your standards, they\u2019re enabling your delusions. We should be able to lean on our close friends for advice and some guidance. Navigating a love life isn\u2019t an easy task, and without a friendly jury, it\u2019s basically a trial by fire.</p>\n                <p>When it comes to crushes, dating and relationships, none of us have it all figured out. It\u2019s easy to get lost in your own feelings. Take a breath. Sometimes your friends can see the red flags or the hidden gems that you can\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>OUTS</p>\n                <p>Chasing the unavailable</p>\n                <p>Newsflash. If they\u2019re unavailable, they\u2019re unavailable. Stop wasting your emotional energy on a figment of your imagination. Chasing someone who isn\u2019t showing up for you isn\u2019t romantic. It\u2019s pathetic.</p>\n                <p>Your time, attention and feelings are worth more than being a background character in someone else\u2019s story. Walk away, save your energy and invest it where it\u2019s actually wanted.</p>\n                <p>Mixed signals</p>\n                <p>Mixed signals are manipulative. One minute, they\u2019re all warmth and charm, the next, they vanish like Houdini. If someone can\u2019t communicate, they\u2019re not complicated, they\u2019re careless.</p>\n                <p>Stop twisting yourself into knots trying to interpret vibes, texts or emojis like a cryptic code. Give your attention and effort to people who actually show up consistently, not ones who leave you guessing.</p>\n                <p>Ghosting</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not Halloween. Grow up.</p>\n                <p>Red flags</p>\n                <p>Listen, we will not be colorblind in 2026. If it\u2019s giving toxic energy, leave. Ignoring warning signs isn\u2019t brave; it's dumb. Likewise, red flags aren\u2019t suggestions; they\u2019re stop signs. Respect them and trust your gut.</p>\n                <p>I apologize if I sound a little harsh. Scratch that, I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019m here to be real with you. If anything I said makes you flinch, chances are it\u2019s about you. And if it is, maybe it\u2019s time for a little self-reflection as we enter the new year.</p>\n                <p>I truly hope everyone had a great first week back. Take some of these thoughts to heart. Let them inspire you, or simply remind you that you matter. Your time, effort and heart deserve to be treated with care.</p>\n                <p>I hope your first week back is as exciting as the stories waiting to be written.</p>\n                <p>Yours truly,</p>\n                <p>Miss Behave</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "title": "UPUA president\u2019s fall attendance raises concerns over bylaws, accountability",
    "author": "Mia Debelevich | News Editor",
    "description": "<p>The University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA) enforces mandatory attendance rules for general assembly members, but its governing documents do not establish attendance requirements for executive board members.</p>\n                <p>In order to pass any legislation, the UPUA needs general assembly members to meet its quorum of one-half plus one. For example, a 58-member general assembly would need 30 in attendance to pass legislation.</p>\n                <p>However, attendance requirements are not applicable to members of UPUA\u2019s executive board, which comprises the president, vice president, chief of staff and deputy chief of staff, as they are not considered members of the general assembly.</p>\n                <p>According to Article VI in the UPUA\u2019s bylaws, \u201cattendance of the General Assembly, Work Session, Committee of the Whole, and Committee Meetings is mandatory for all members of the Assembly.\u201d Any unexcused absences by general assembly members results in deficiency points.</p>\n                <p>Once representatives reach three deficiency points, their membership is reviewed, according to UPUA Vice President Noah Youcheff. He said if representatives attend tabling events, write extra legislation or engage in UPUA extracurricular work, they can bring their deficiency points down.</p>\n                <p>Hunter Steach, chief justice, said the expectation for executive attendance is an \u201cunsung rule,\u201d typically passed down from preceding presidents. He said some of the problems the UPUA had this past semester can be \u201cattributed to members of the executive branch not being there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Steach said he \u201chardly remembers\u201d any absences from the past three UPUA presidents. However, the same can not be said for Rasha Elwakil.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don't think it\u2019s the best reflection at all times, because we had a lot of attendance problems just across the board,\u201d Steach said. \u201cI've been in UPUA for four years and been going to GA \u2014 pretty much every GA \u2014 for the last four years, and from my perspective, I don't think we've ever struggled with attendance across the board as much as last semester.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Steach said he would be open to reviewing rules regarding attendance or introducing a formal mechanism that clearly outlines the expectations of executive members.</p>\n                <p>Elwakil arrived to the following meetings after the halfway point: Oct. 8, Oct. 29, Nov. 5 and Dec. 3.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI chose to be selfish and go to a (panhellenic) event because that was our last one of the year,\u201d Elwakil said at the Dec. 3 meeting. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s very hypocritical of me to not apologize when I\u2019ve been asking you guys to show up and be in attendance every week, and so I just did want to give that apology real quick and say I\u2019m truly sorry for that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Dec. 3 meeting was delayed due to an inability to meet quorum. Representatives were asked by Kat Hogan and Youcheff to contact other representatives and ask if they could attend the meeting.</p>\n                <p>Elwakil did not give her report at this meeting, stating she didn\u2019t want to take up more time of those in attendance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'm not perfect, and I won't say I was a perfect president,\u201d Elwakil said in an interview. \u201cBut I do say that I am trying my best and I think I am showing up for the organization.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Elwakil said only one UPUA member came to her with concerns about her absences following the Dec. 3 meeting. The conversation made her realize it was unnecessary to come late, she said.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI should have shown up, and I did reflect on that, and moving forward this semester, I'm making sure that I show up to everything, hopefully,\u201d Elwakil said.</p>\n                <p>Youcheff said attendance is a \u201cbig thing\u201d for UPUA, as it\u2019s important to meet quorum, hence the attendance requirements for representatives. He said the steering committee \u2014 which includes the president, vice president, chief of staff, chief justice and the five legislative committee chairs \u2014 has possible plans to intensify attendance requirements this semester.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been very amenable to the argument for implementing attendance points, and I think that conversation is going to be pretty big this year when we go into these governing document reviews and talk about that,\u201d Youcheff said.</p>\n                <p>Youcheff said people have varying opinions on the importance of attendance to the executive and judicial branches.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt kind of depends on what you view general assembly as,\u201d Youcheff said. \u201cIf you see it as this meeting where the whole student government gets together once a week and kind of gets their business done, a lot of people think everyone should be there for that. Other people think that the executive, judicial roles in general assembly aren\u2019t as crucial.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The vice president has to chair the assembly per 6.2.3 clause 2 of Article VI of the UPUA Constitution \u2014 so he described his attendance as necessary.</p>\n                <p>The clause states: \u201cThe Vice President shall preside over the meetings of the Assembly, retain floor privileges, and vote solely in the cases that will influence the outcome of a tied vote, except on votes to override a veto of the President.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite this, attendance is not tracked nor explicitly constitutionally required for the vice president of the organization. He said he\u2019s held accountable by representatives.</p>\n                <p>In the fall semester, Youcheff came to the beginning of the Oct. 29 meeting, but left due to a scheduled exam.

    "title": "\u2018That's going to cost you\u2019 | Penn State basketball loses rebounding, 2nd-chance point battles vs. UCLA",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After Mike Rhoades started his opening statement by thanking the fans who showed up like he usually does, he said what he felt was the reason behind UCLA\u2019s 71-60 win over Penn State on Wednesday night.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said it \u201ccame down\u201d to second-chance points with the Bruins outscoring the Nittany Lions 19 to 4 in that category. It was the main result of UCLA winning the rebound battle 32 to 21 as the Bruins secured a double-digit road win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought we've been rebounding the ball pretty well. We didn't do that today,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe give up too many second-chance points, and that's going to cost you. So I think some of it was fatigue, some of it was young guys out there, but you got to find a way to scrap out some defensive rebounds and give yourself a chance. We didn't do that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Before UCLA pulled away for the victory, Penn State had the Bruins in striking distance throughout the second half. With around 10:00 left in the game, UCLA missed three-straight 3-pointers, but it grabbed the offensive board every time before guard Trent Perry knocked down a jumper to give his squad a 52-49 lead.</p>\n                <p>A similar sequence happened a few minutes later as guard Donovan Dent missed a layup, but UCLA got the offensive rebound and got two more second-chance points via a pair of free throws by Perry. Those points gave the Bruins a 60-52 advantage as that was the closest the Nittany Lions were to the lead for the remaining 6:04 of the game.</p>\n                <p>Wing Eli Rice didn\u2019t know the exact statistics when he spoke with the media postgame, but he even knew that UCLA won the rebounding and second-chance point battles.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt definitely hurt us,\u201d Rice said. \u201cTheir second-chance points, I'm not sure what they are, but I'm sure it probably was way more than ours. So I mean, it definitely hurt us, and that's always a vocal point going into every game to box out and then with our offensive rebounds. But that's definitely what hurt us today, was the reason we lost again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Bruins finished the night with 11 offensive rebounds compared to Penn State\u2019s six. Furthermore, all four of the Nittany Lions\u2019 second-chance points came within the last four minutes of the game, when the Bruins consistently had a double-digit lead.</p>\n                <p>UCLA 6-foot-9 forward Tyler Bilodeau and 6-foot-10 center Steven Jamerson II totaled nine and eight rebounds, respectively. Both of them are taller than every Penn State player who saw minutes in Wednesday\u2019s game, except for freshman 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSome of it is size. Some of it is a young guy not pushing them out early enough,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe give up a bunch of offensive rebounds on the backside today because we didn't do our work early. We got to work on it. We got to continue to work on it. We do work on it every day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rebounding is an issue for Penn State that even popped up in the nonconference schedule. Against Campbell on Dec. 2, the Nittany Lions were outrebounded 39 to 30.</p>\n                <p>Throughout the start of the Big Ten slate, Penn State has been outrebounded in four of six games \u2014 the Michigan and Purdue games are the two contests the Nittany Lions won the battle on the glass. On the year, Penn State is averaging a margin of -2.1 rebounds per game.</p>\n                <p>Penn State not getting a rebound against UCLA began to stack up, highlighting the difference in skill between the two teams.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey took advantage of it,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cGood players take advantage of small errors. And you just got to harp on it all the time. So when you're dealing with young guys, you hold them accountable, you teach them, you show them. You keep doing it over again until they become good habits. You want it to be tomorrow morning, but the reality of it is 18 to 22-year-olds, nothing happens overnight. You just gotta keep working on it. Keep building habits. That's part of the culture you gotta build.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>UCLA\u2019s first-ever trip to State College was an eventful one.</p>\n                <p>In the midst of a three-game losing streak \u2013 all ranked opponents \u2013 Penn State has been desperate for a win.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions fought hard in their recent stretch of games and kept it interesting, but just weren\u2019t able to close it out, including a near-upset over then-ranked No. 2 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Once again, the blue and white just didn\u2019t have enough to keep up, and remain winless in conference play after falling to UCLA 71-60.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a tough game. I think it came down to second-chance points,\u201d Mike Rhoades said. \u201cWe gave up. We battled; we were in striking distance a few times. As the game went on, we settled\u2026 We gave up too many second-chance points, and that\u2019s gonna cost you.\u201d</p>\n                <p>To kick off just the third all-time meeting between the two programs, Penn State won the opening tipoff only to turn it over, giving the Bruins an optimal scoring opportunity.</p>\n                <p>However, a missed UCLA three-pointer turned into a defensive rebound, leading to an Ivan Juri\u0107 posterizing slam that put the Nittany Lions on the board first.</p>\n                <p>At the first media timeout, Penn State found itself with a 6-2 edge backed by Juri\u0107\u2019s four points and three forced Bruins turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Six points for Trent Perry in the early going gave the Bruins an 11-8 lead, but it didn\u2019t last long as Eli Rice drained two shots back-to-back, including a three-pointer, which tied the affair at 13-13.</p>\n                <p>The two cross-country foes traded points back-and-forth for a while and kept it tied up until momentum seemed to shift slightly to the blue and white\u2019s end of the court as a few Bruins turnovers and fouls allowed Penn State to take a 21-17 lead.</p>\n                <p>The low scoring continued for the last few minutes of the first half until UCLA started to put points on the board quickly, with just under two minutes left.</p>\n                <p>Just before the Bruins started up the scoring again, Freddie Dilione V went down with an ankle injury that Rhoades later said was a sprained ankle. Dilione V missed the remainder of the game, and that absence was felt all around.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFreddie went down; that obviously hurt us, but I think it was a group thing,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing good as a group.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Tyler Bilodeau and Eric Freeny each drained a three-pointer to put the Bruins in control at 29-21, but Melih Tunca, draining both of his free throws just before time expired, cut the blue and white lead to six points at the half.</p>\n                <p>Perry was the all-around points leader at the half with eight, shooting one-for-five from the field, but drilling six free throws on as many attempts.</p>\n                <p>Not only was the score close, but so was the rest of the game. Penn State was shooting 39% from the field while UCLA was shooting 35%.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions knocked down just one three-pointer in the first half and sent the Bruins to the charity stripe ten times, where they didn\u2019t miss once.</p>\n                <p>Tunca hit one from downtown to start the second half for his first points of the night aside from free throws.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was closing in, cutting the deficit to 31-30 until a UCLA three-pointer stopped the effort. The Nittany Lions matched it with a Rice three, but it wasn\u2019t enough to gain an edge.</p>\n                <p>On fire to start the second half, Perry sank another three-pointer to once again grab a four-point lead and give himself 14 points on the night, still the most from either end to that point.</p>\n                <p>UCLA grabbed an eight-point lead, its largest of the night, after a Bilodeau and-one. It didn\u2019t take long for Penn State to close in, though, as points came in rapid succession.</p>\n                <p>Dominick Stewart\u2019s physicality and long-range shooting gave the Nittany Lions their first lead since the late stages of the first half, but an immediate Bilodeau three-pointer put the Bruins back up with a slight 50-49 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions found themselves in the midst of an 11-1 UCLA run, however, and went down 58-50 not long after they captured that hard-fought lead.</p>\n                <p>Perry and Bilodeau had 24 and 21 points each, with five minutes left to play as the Bruins jumped up to a 63-52 lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSometimes you get lost in the game,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201c(UCLA) made their threes, and we didn\u2019t. That was a huge difference.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Eric Dailey Jr. was the only other UCLA starter with any points.</p>\n                <p>Penn State struck back, but being down 13 points with three minutes to play is not a recipe for success.</p>\n                <p>The deficit proved insurmountable, and the Nittany Lions suffered their fourth-straight loss, falling 71-60.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s super frustrating,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI mean, close doesn\u2019t get you the win; it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s still a zero in the column. It\u2019s definitely frustrating, but we want to win, we don\u2019t want to be close.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Now at 9-8 on the year, Penn State finds itself just one game ahead of Northwestern and two games ahead of Maryland in the Big Ten Standings.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s standout freshman Kayden Mingo was out again with a broken nose sustained in practice before the Michigan game. He underwent successful surgery but will be \u201cout for a while.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Tibor Mirti\u010d also missed action with a knee injury. Mirti\u010d will \u201cbe out for a little bit\u201d as his knee is \u201cjust rehabbing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions look to snap their now four-game losing streak when they hit the road and head south to Maryland to take on the Terrapins on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Scheduled tipoff is set for noon.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Penn State notebook | Cael Sanderson reveals status of Aaron Nagao, talks Iowa in weekly availability",
    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Following a win against Rutgers to open up conference play, Penn State will hit the road this weekend for a pair of duals, facing Iowa on Friday and Northwestern on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Ahead of wrestling a pair of conference foes, Cael Sanderson met with the media to discuss where the program sits heading into the new year as well as his business venture.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he had to say.</p>\n                <p>Aaron Nagao</p>\n                <p>After suffering an injury in the Black Knight Invitational in November, Aaron Nagao returned to the mat in December in the Southern Scuffle, only for him to medically forfeit after winning his first match.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson provided a status update on Nagao, and it\u2019s one that won\u2019t have him suit up at 141 pounds for the remainder of the year. Sanderson said \u201che\u2019s definitely done for the season.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cHas had some setbacks, obviously, with that shoulder, and that's a tough one to come back from, but he's kind of got to restart that process,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Nagao returned to the mat this year after having not wrestled for close to two years. He\u2019ll finish the season with a 5-2 record, with both of his losses coming on medical forfeits.</p>\n                <p>He will likely need surgery, as Sanderson mentioned postgame after the win over Rutgers. In place of Nagao, Braeden Davis will likely be the starter at 141 the rest of the way.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe reality of what Aaron was coming back from, just an uphill battle,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cShoulders are really challenging in our sport. It's complicated, obviously, joint positions you get put in wrestling, but if anyone could do it, it was Aaron. So, we want to give him the best support and opportunity we could give him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Iowa</p>\n                <p>Just like Penn State, Iowa has historically been in the top tier of collegiate wrestling programs.</p>\n                <p>Come Friday night, in a battle between the No. 1 Nittany Lions and the No. 4 Hawkeyes, Sanderson knows his team will have to bring it, but still keep the main thing the main thing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSame mentality,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cOf course, Iowa is a great opponent. Great wrestlers, great coaches, great tradition and history. We got to be ready to roll.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Carver Hawkeye Area notoriously is known for being a raucous environment and drawing great crowds. There\u2019s no doubt the Hawkeye faithful will bring the juice on Friday night.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said Penn State will be ready for it, as the squad has wrestled in a handful of similar atmospheres, paired with having them in their own backyard.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we're blessed. I mean, most of the places we go, we get a great crowd,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe wrestle in front of a great crowd here at Penn State, whether it's in Rec Hall or the (Bryce) Jordan Center. So we're used to getting to compete in front of enthusiastic fans. That makes what we do more fun and worthwhile.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Iowa has a handful of talented wrestlers, notably No. 1 Angelo Ferrari at 184 pounds, No. 3 Michael Caliendo at 165 and No. 5 Ben Kueter at 285. At 197 pounds, Penn State could see Gabe Arnold or Harvey Ludington, as previous starter Massoma Endene is no longer with the team.</p>\n                <p>Regardless of who is wrestling or how good the opponent may be, Penn State has heavy hitters of their own.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur guys are just gonna do what they do,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cIt doesn't make a lot of sense to make any adjustments. Obviously, you're aware of your opponents, but at the same time, the long-term plan is let's get better at what we do, and keep improving and go compete to the best of our ability with some fire and enthusiasm.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Masanosuke Ono</p>\n                <p>It was big news for Penn State when it landed Japanese world champion Masanosuke Ono to its roster during the offseason.</p>\n                <p>During his preseason media availability, Sanderson said the plan for Ono would be for him to redshirt. Now, there\u2019s questions as to if he\u2019ll actually compete this year due to his health.</p>\n                <p>Ono sustained a kidney illness, according to a report from Wrestling Spirits. The news came out in light of him supposed to wrestle in Japan\u2019s Emperor\u2019s Cup in December, but he ended up withdrawing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve been discussing that. But, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see him this year or not. He\u2019s got to get back and get healthy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Cael\u2019s Cookie</p>\n                <p>Off the mat and into the kitchen, Sanderson was asked about his new business venture that has to do with cookies to wrap up the media session.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson, a self-proclaimed enjoyer of cookies, tried to start his own line close to 20 years ago but didn\u2019t find much triumph.</p>\n                <p>Now, he recently got back into the field as an enjoyable side quest and is finding more success, releasing \u201cCael\u2019s Cookie.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI have a very small part in it, but it was something that\u2019s kind of fun and I really like them,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cBasically just got a group of killers to kind of take it and run with it and that's what they're doing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Sam Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Who doesn\u2019t like scoring?</p>\n                <p>It was a high-scoring affair and a historic night for Ohio State as Penn State battled with the No. 14 Buckeyes in the Jerome Schottenstein Center.</p>\n                <p>Despite the stats, Penn State\u2019s 0-6 Big Ten record and 7-10 overall losing record did not faze the scarlet and white, who put forth a Big Ten season-high of 108 points scored in a single game.</p>\n                <p>Last year, the meeting between Penn State and Ohio State served as a \u2018trap game\u2019 for the Buckeyes. This season, it marked nothing more than a regular Big Ten clash.</p>\n                <p>However, the Lady Lions finally played at their opponent's level, not backing down despite early struggles. Less surprisingly, more of the same struggles plagued Penn State in a 108-84 loss.</p>\n                <p>Hunched over as she observed from the bench, coach Carolyn Kieger could only watch as a disparagingly large Buckeye lead mounted early on. In the blink of an eye, Ohio State found itself holding a double-digit lead.</p>\n                <p>As the game approached, Penn State had remained searching for its spark. On Wednesday night, the rookie, Nyla McFadden, earned the start as Tea Cleante moved to the bench. However, as the season has already proved, the lineups haven\u2019t mattered.</p>\n                <p>The turnovers, slow starts, and long runs have.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions allowed a massive run out of the gate as Ohio State took advantage of another slow start. Penn State endured a drought that lasted over halfway through the first quarter with no points.</p>\n                <p>It was the guard-big duo of Jaloni Cambridge and Elsa Lemmila that dominated as Penn State surrendered the mass of its points inside. Following a major deficit, the Lady Lions began to wake up and combated the run with disciplined basketball.</p>\n                <p>Moriah Murray, who hadn\u2019t scored in double-digits since her outing against VCU, was the main culprit. While Kiyomi McMiller established an offensive rhythm, it was others who added the flare Kieger had sought.</p>\n                <p>Instead of digging a bigger hole, Penn State settled in as the adjustments began to take place. Penn State took a trip down memory lane to revisit its win last season. Despite the mostly new roster, there were two constants who had seen what it took.</p>\n                <p>Along with Murray, Gracie Merkle became the focal point of the offense. Beyond the arc, Murray had fired back with several triples, while Merkle took advantage of the height advantage inside. The pairing successfully brought Penn State back within striking range after scoring 13 and 12 points at the break.</p>\n                <p>As the old saying goes, \u2018Defense wins championships.\u2019 If Penn State were to pull off another upset over Ohio State, it would need an elite defensive effort to complement the offense. Both Cambridge and Lemmila proved to be an issue on that end as they had combined for 34 points at the break.</p>\n                <p>Being down by less than ten points at the half has become an unfamiliar sight for the Lady Lions. Ultimately, the blueprint had been laid out before their eyes. Penn State had to get stops.</p>\n                <p>After switching out of a full-court press, Penn State favored a 3-2 zone, aimed to force the ball out of Cambridge and Lemmila\u2019s hands. Yet, what followed wasn\u2019t the result Penn State had hoped for.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State followed Kieger\u2019s lead in utilizing a zone to contain the Merkle inside. The Buckeyes got their way as Merkle\u2019s quiet third frame gave way to a near 20-point lead. But Penn State was scratching and clawing.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions were able to generate points off turnovers, turning defense into offense. Just as McMiller neared 20 points, Penn State found itself down by ten points. Ohio State began to expose Penn State\u2019s defense as the three-point shooting inserted the dagger.</p>\n                <p>Chance Gray hit seven threes on the night, many of which came in the second half. In addition, Ohio State made 17 triples; the red-hot offense had stalled all the momentum the Lady Lions were building up, and closed the door for good.</p>\n                <p>Cambridge, Gray, and Lemmila led the team, all scoring above 20 points each, and combining for 77 points. There was no overcoming that margin for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s Amiya Evans did not suit up in her second-straight contest.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will host Rutgers on Sunday, Jan. 18, for the school\u2019s White Out game, sponsored by THON. The Scarlet Knights, with a 0-6 Big Ten record, will present Penn State\u2019s best opportunity to earn its first conference victory.

Previously, Penn State had just one head defensive line coach, but the two positions are now separate.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what to know about Smith, who\u2019s moving east from one Big Ten school to another.</p>\n                <p>Coaching career</p>\n                <p>Smith has spent the last three seasons with Northwestern as its defensive line coach, being selected to the 2025 American Football Coaches Association \u201c35 Under 35\u201d list, which identifies premier young coaches in the football industry.</p>\n                <p>Before joining the Wildcats, Smith spent six years at South Dakota State, spending the first two as the defensive tackles coach before becoming the full-time defensive line coach.</p>\n                <p>He saw ample success with the Jackrabbits, winning the FCS National Championship in Smith\u2019s last year with the program while making the playoffs each season he was there.</p>\n                <p>Smith\u2019s defensive line at South Dakota State allowed just 88.1 rushing yards per game in 2022, which ranked first in the FCS, while tying for fourth in sacks with 39. In his four years as the defensive line coach, the Jackrabbits allowed 106.4 rushing yards per game.</p>\n                <p>In the years prior to Smith\u2019s time at South Dakota State, he worked under Campbell at both Toledo and Iowa State. The Oklahoma native spent 2014-15 as a graduate assistant with the Rockets before doing the same with the Cyclones in 2016.</p>\n                <p>Smith\u2019s first coaching job, however, was in 2013 as a strength and conditioning intern at Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>Playing career</p>\n                <p>Not only did Smith coach under Campbell previously, he also played for him.

Winkelman led the team in tackles for loss and sacks, but is no longer playing football.</p>\n                <p>Aidan Hubbard was the star under Smith at Northwestern, as the defensive end finished his career fifth on the Wildcats\u2019 all-time sacks list and All-Big Ten honors twice.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Harvey led the Nittany Lions with 14 kills on 18 attempts, hitting a resounding 0.667.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has the opportunity to build on its hot start with matches against St. Thomas Aquinas at 7 p.m. Thursday and Lewis at 7 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>St. Thomas Aquinas</p>\n                <p>The Spartans are off to a rough start, losing their first two matchups with Pepperdine and USC and getting swept in the process.</p>\n                <p>However, St. Thomas Aquinas suffered the same fate at the start of last year\u2019s season before finishing 16-9 behind a seven-match and five-match win streak.</p>\n                <p>Through their first two games, outside hitter Kyran Versteegen leads the Spartans, accounting for 16 kills this season, more than doubling the total of his next closest teammate.</p>\n                <p>The junior will need to have his best performance of the season in order to give the Spartans a shot at stealing a victory in Happy Valley, especially if Harvey continues to swing effectively for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>This matchup marks the first all-time between Penn State and St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>\n                <p>Lewis</p>\n                <p>Unlike the Spartans, Lewis heads into this matchup with momentum after winning each of its first two matches against Menlo College and No. 9 Stanford, both with sweeps.</p>\n                <p>Oguzhan Oguz leads the Flyers in kills with 26 and leads their frontline. However, Lewis has a balanced attack, with three players already collecting 20 or more kills this season. Winning the battle at the net will be key in their matchup with the Nittany Lions, as Harvey, Trubey and Matthew Luoma have an attempt to keep Penn State rolling.</p>\n                <p>Lewis arrives off a strong season, earning a 22-9 record, including a sweep victory over the blue and white in the teams\u2019 only meeting of the season.</p>\n                <p>This season, Penn State has the advantage of home court, which is crucial for securing a victory, as Lewis finished 7-6 away from home last year, compared to its 14-3 home record.</p>\n                <p>Both teams are off to strong starts, and this will be an early test for both squads as the season begins to ramp up.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mayor Ezra Nanes addressed the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7 during a State College Borough Council meeting Monday.</p>\n                <p>Nanes said Good\u2019s death sent \u201cripple effects\u201d throughout the community and called for a reaffirmation of the borough\u2019s policies regarding immigration operations occurring in State College.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere have been requests for information pertaining to residents\u2019 rights when it comes to immigration enforcement, and other things as far as what federal law enforcement officers are able to do, where they are able to go, what is required of them under the laws of the United States, the laws of the Commonwealth and the ordinances of the borough,\u201d Nanes said. \u201cI think it's important that we make this information publicly available because there is a great feeling of fear and anger and concern over these events and we want to keep our community safe and people here want to be safe.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council President Evan Myers said he was appalled by some of the measures he had seen people take to ensure that their citizenship could be proven should they be stopped by ICE.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI know people of color, born in the United States, who carried their passports with them on their persons, people in our community, to prove their own citizenship, born in the hospital a few miles away from here,\u201d Myers said.</p>\n                <p>Myers said it was important for the council to show its support for the State College community as well as to develop measures to ensure their rights are protected.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA year ago, even before Trump took office, this council started to discuss things we could do to protect our residents,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWe must begin to explore ways that our local government, right here in State College, can put in motion safeguards beyond the things that we're already doing, that the mayor alluded to, for those that live here. I'm not sure what they all are, but there are things we need to address and address them quickly over the next coming weeks.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council member Nalini Krishnankutty said much of the fear and anxiety from State College residents stemmed from concerns that local law enforcement organizations may not be equipped to ensure peoples\u2019 safety while handling the different operating procedures of external organizations.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere were people who were not feeling safe anymore in the sense that it doesn't matter what our local policing is committed to, we might have other law enforcement agencies that might not be practicing the same things,\u201d Krishnankutty said. \u201cIf they do something that doesn't seem right, we are not sure there's going to be an independent investigation. It's just very different from, or appears to be different from, what we are committed to and we don't seem to have the resources to assure us that we are safe if other law enforcement comes into our community.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn council, we've already decried the killings of people like Melissa Hortman and Charlie Kirk, but this feels different on a different level, because our own government did it,\u201d Council Member Matt Herndon added.\u201c...I've seen people say it's not unusual for politicians to take factual liberties and while this may be true for many, it does not have to be and we should not accept it. Facts matter, the truth matters, we must demand the truth.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council member Gopal Balachandran said it was \u201cchilling\u201d to see the reaction of ICE agents immediately after Good\u2019s death and how it was another example of law enforcement agencies failing to prevent acts of violence upon those they are meant to protect.</p>\n                <p>He said both Democrats and Republicans are responsible for empowering ICE in their own ways and believed it was up to bipartisan action to curb the actions of the federal government, both at home and abroad.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe problems with our immigration laws stretch long and far; our problems with our foreign policy stretch far and wide, and they are bipartisan issues, meaning that Democrats and Republicans bear responsibility for it,\u201d Balachandran said. \u201cWhile I am horrified by what has happened and I do believe that we need to do whatever we can to fight what appears to be very serious threats to our democracy, the rule of law, and the respect for human rights and dignity, we should not kid ourselves that this somehow began with the Trump administration in 2024 when it's been an ongoing feature of American political life and American foreign policy for a very, very long time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BOROUGH COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Weekly recap | Penn State men's hockey earned Big Ten sweep despite injury concerns",
    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s hockey used a rejuvenated lineup to dominate Minnesota in a sweep last weekend. While it played its best games of the season, it didn\u2019t escape unscathed. A few key injuries sustained in the Big Ten series will be key moving forward for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Defense</p>\n                <p>Throughout the first half of the season, Penn State\u2019s defense struggled to find an identity, which was an issue Guy Gadowsky preached on in nearly every press conference until winter break.</p>\n                <p>Upon return, and the return of Cade Christenson, Penn State\u2019s defense has begun showing some consistency and an identity that can lead the Nittany Lions forward.</p>\n                <p>Every series showed a shuffling of lines prior to these past two weeks. Now, the pairings of Jackson Smith-Jarod Crespo and Mac Gadowsky-Christenson have performed well enough to remain together long term.</p>\n                <p>The defense allowed both Kevin Reidler and Josh Fleming to benefit, giving up just two goals behind a scrappy bunch that broke up passes, exited the defensive zone cleanly and contributed to the scoreboard as well.</p>\n                <p>Penalties</p>\n                <p>One of the blue and white\u2019s defining traits in the 2025 half of the season was its tendency to engage in heated matchups that stuck them in the penalty box for extended periods of games. Heading into the break, Penn State was the most penalized team in the country.</p>\n                <p>Against Minnesota, Penn State took victories without lighting up the penalty board. The Nittany Lions had just three penalties in the first game, in which they shut out the Golden Gophers, and kept the number low in Game 2.</p>\n                <p>This was seemingly the product of cleaner defensive play that was able to control the pace without crossing the line.</p>\n                <p>Outside of just penalty kill, this showed deeper progress for the Nittany Lions\u2019 mindset. They weren\u2019t just avoiding penalties, they were keeping their heads level, even in a second game where Minnesota pushed their boundaries.</p>\n                <p>The only moment all weekend where Penn Star overstated their emotions was after Braedon Ford was injured on a hit into the boards.</p>\n                <p>Injuries</p>\n                <p>While Penn State regained Aiden Fink and Christenson over break, the hockey gods wouldn\u2019t let them off the hook. The team suffered a few injuries during the series with Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>The big one came in the first period Saturday when Charlie Cerrato left the game, not returning to action last weekend. Gadowsky stated that Cerrato was day-to-day heading towards Penn State\u2019s series against Notre Dame.</p>\n                <p>Casey Aman and Shea Van Olm are also role-players who are day-to-day heading into this weekend. Aman served as the extra skater against Minnesota on Saturday, while Van Olm fills a bottom-six role.</p>\n                <p>Van Olm and Cerrato will be even more important heading into this weekend with the news that Braedon Ford will be out of action long term with a lower-body injury. Ford took a shot to his ankle while being hit into the boards and spent a prolonged time on the ice before being helped off. Prior to the injury, he scored his first goal of the year off a feed from Gavin McKenna.</p>\n                <p>These injuries will test Penn State\u2019s forward depth that has been an issue for them throughout the season. However, during the last games, the depth started showing up for Penn State. Luke Misa and Lev Katzin each showed up on the score sheet against Minnesota. Contributions like those will need to be the answer to how Penn State weathers the injury bug.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>For the first time since coach Carolyn Kieger\u2019s first season with Penn State in 2019 \u2014 excluding the shortened COVID year \u2014 the Lady Lions are halfway through January with a losing record.</p>\n                <p>Sitting at 7-10, Penn State has been struggling to find answers during its six-game losing streak. With another top-25 Big Ten opponent on the schedule this week, answers need to be found soon.</p>\n                <p>During the weekly media session, Kieger spoke about those changes, as well as the future outlook of the team.</p>\n                <p>Scouting the Buckeyes</p>\n                <p>Despite upsetting Ohio State in last year\u2019s matchup, chances are very low for a repeat on Wednesday, with ESPN Analytics giving Penn State just a 3.7% chance of winning.</p>\n                <p>The Buckeyes are home to several of the best players in the Big Ten, including Jaloni Cambridge. Cambridge is averaging 21.2 points per game through 17 games and has a pair of 30-plus point performances.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe got to build a wall around Jaloni,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cShe\u2019s probably the number one player in the country right now in transition offense. She\u2019s super talented at running, so we need to change up defenses a bit to give pressure.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In addition to the offensive challenges presented by Ohio State, the Buckeyes also have one of the top defenses in the country, forcing 13.4 steals per game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously, we need to take care of the ball,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cSo we got to weather the press. We know they're going to get up and in full court on every play.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Defensive changes</p>\n                <p>After giving up 94 points to Illinois and 105 points to Michigan, Sunday\u2019s postgame press conference was centered around defense.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions allowed the Fighting Illini to shoot nearly 60% from the field and 50% from 3-point range as they fell by 16 points.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think a lot of it comes down to one-on-one defense,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe call it guarding your yard, three feet in both directions.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Freshman Nyla McFadden stood out as a strong defensive presence against Illinois, guarding every position on the floor. However, the rest of the team\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t satisfy Kieger\u2019s expectations.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe willingness to step up and guard your area, guard your yard, (is missing),\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI can\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s one thing, but if I had to bottle it up all into one word, it would be toughness.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Retention</p>\n                <p>Amidst a six-game losing streak with five more top-25 matchups on the horizon, Penn State has fallen out of March Madness contention and are teetering on the verge of missing the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions have a young squad with only two seniors and all of its starters set to return next year.</p>\n                <p>However, in the ever-changing world of college sports, retention has become a hot-topic issue, and Kieger is well aware of that with the offseason quickly approaching.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s obviously on the forefront of everyone's minds right now in college athletics,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cPlayers are motivated by different things, so relationships and player retention are big things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After losing 11 players to the transfer portal in the last two years, Kieger has to focus on bringing back Moriah Murray, Kiyomi McMiller and Gracie Merkle next season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBuilding continuity and keeping players and making transformational changes and building energy (are important),\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI think you see the teams that are having the most success right now have been together for a couple years to build that synergy amongst their star players.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Several State College residents spoke before the borough council during a meeting Monday to express concerns over the redevelopment of Arnold Addison Court, known informally as Addison Court.</p>\n                <p>The building, which opened in 1994 to provide affordable housing to elderly and handicapped State College Borough residents within the downtown area, has already seen preliminary plans for its redevelopment into a mixed-use structure viewed by the State College Design Review Board during a meeting last Tuesday.</p>\n                <p>Kathryn Santoro, a tenant of Addison Court, said she was having trouble finding housing outside of the complex due to unaffordability, as well as most not being handicapped-accessible.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI came to Addison Court because it's 55 and over and I wanted to be close to the community,\u201d Santoro said. \u201cYou're going to put a condo in Addison Court. It's gonna contain four or five bedrooms. How come you guys, borough and the planning commission, say, \u2018Wait a minute: is it all about money?\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>Santoro said she was concerned the new development would only prioritize Penn State students and believed its construction would push out older residents living in that area.</p>\n                <p>Richard McCarty, another tenant of Addison Court, said it\u2019s a newer building, and those residing within it have disabilities that would be impacted by the redevelopment.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of (residents) possess particular disabilities, etc., from which they don't even go outside their doors and stuff,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cThere are over 60 individuals out of the 80 plus units in Addison Court, which is not an old building. There are old buildings in State College that probably should be torn down. Addison Court, I do not believe, is one of those.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council President Evan Myers said it was the borough\u2019s responsibility to its residents to find ways to ensure that the tenants of Addison Court are able to find housing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe community is crying for help,\u201d Myers said. \u201cEven though we have no ownership in Addison Court, and we never did, we did help facilitate its construction and use it and behooves us to do all we can to help to provide some similar living situation, and we should do what we can to make that happen.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Council member Kevin Kassab said he felt it was the borough\u2019s responsibility to ensure the tenants of Addison Court were able to find housing in a market that does not have many options for them.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe had an investment, or whatever we'd had, when Addison Court was built, putting these individuals into a home that they thought was gonna be their home until they passed and now they're going to be displaced so I do feel kind of like it's sort of something,\u201d Kassab said. \u201cSomehow, we have to figure out and it's gonna be tough because we all know affordable housing in the borough practically doesn't exist.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Josh Portney, another council member said Addison Court has several connections to the organization through its work to establish the complex.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have 60 individuals that, in a couple years, may lose their house,\u201d Portney said. \u201cThe borough council in 1990 shepherded this building from beginning to end.

    "description": "<p>The State College Borough Council resumed discussions on revisions to the ordinance that founded the Community Oversight Board (COB), codified as borough ordinance 2164, during a meeting on Monday.</p>\n                <p>The revisions, which were written in response to feedback during a council meeting on Sept. 8, 2025, include the mandated training of new committee members to be completed to the standards set by the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement (NACOLE) with a report of this training also being required to be submitted annually.</p>\n                <p>Council member Gopal Balachandran said he was concerned with the prioritization of law enforcement training from NACOLE and their training guidelines.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think for the purposes of this training, there's enough flexibility here that's going to allow different sources of information but I would just highlight that, as far as an organization goes, unless we really know what their composition and their viewpoint is, it might be promoting one particular viewpoint, as opposed to a neutral viewpoint,\u201d Balachandran said.</p>\n                <p>Balachandran said it was important to look outside of the law enforcement perspective in order to better understand the impact of policing on State College. He said he found that, while litigating the Subramanyam \u201cSubu\u201d Vedam case, internal oversight measures within law enforcement aren\u2019t always successful in preventing misconduct.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat a lot of people don't know is that there was a process in place for the D.A.'s office to be able to review old convictions which was called a conviction integrity unit and in many ways, it was meant to be kind of like an oversight process within the DA's office, sort of like an internal affairs unit or maybe even like the community oversight board,\u201d Balachandran said. \u201cWhen the Centre County District Attorney looked at the same information that I looked at, they decided there was no problem with Subu Vedam's conviction. It was completely correct. All the policing was great. There was no improper misconduct at all. Well, lo and behold, when we actually litigate the case, we find that there is a whole lot of misconduct that occurred.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Nalini Krishnankutty, another council member, said she wanted to see an increased emphasis on anti-bias, policing and immigration within the training of new COB members along with an overview of policies detailing the training and applications for use of force.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey are going to overview everything and the reason I want to elevate these two is because all members should really know that,\u201d Krishnankutty said. \u201cI'd really like to have those come up.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After further discussion among the council, the issue was tabled for later discussion on Feb. 2, when the council is expected to make a final decision.</p>\n                <p>MORE BOROUGH COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Playing with homecourt advantage over two top teams from the Big Ten, Penn State looked for its first win since early December in last week\u2019s outings.</p>\n                <p>Instead, the Lady Lions endured a blowout loss to Michigan and suffered a close loss to Illinois, extending their losing streak to six games.</p>\n                <p>Despite falling to 7-10 on the year, there were several takeaways \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 from last week\u2019s 0-2 stretch.</p>\n                <p>Rise of McFadden</p>\n                <p>Despite playing in 16 games this season, 30% of freshman Nyla McFadden\u2019s minutes this season came from last week.</p>\n                <p>The Fort Lauderdale, Florida, native was praised for coach Carolyn Kieger postgame, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s been doing everything we\u2019ve asked, working her butt off and staying true to the process. I really can\u2019t say enough about her.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In just 12 minutes against the Wolverines, McFadden scored 10 points, including going 2-for-2 from deep.</p>\n                <p>In the following game, she played a career-high 27 minutes and posted another double-digit performance. McFadden scored 12 points with two rebounds and two assists as she earned her first career start.</p>\n                <p>Standing at just 6-foot, McFadden\u2019s quickness and toughness allowed her to guard nearly every position on the floor on Sunday, making herself a valuable asset for the remainder of the season.</p>\n                <p>Defense</p>\n                <p>Six \u2014 that\u2019s how many times coach Kieger said the word defense in her two minutes and fifteen seconds of postgame media on Sunday. Those weren\u2019t positive references either.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions gave up 105 points to Michigan on Thursday and 92 to Illinois, two of the highest scoring totals of the season.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offense put up 76 points on Sunday, which would\u2019ve been enough to win half the games so far this season. Instead, the defense allowed the Fighting Illini to shoot nearly 60% from the court with 50% from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>Different aspects of the blue and white\u2019s defense showed up, as it forced 21 turnovers on Illinois. However, they only recorded nine turnovers against the Wolverines.</p>\n                <p>Rebounding was a similar struggle during Sunday\u2019s game, as the Lady Lions allowed 10 offensive rebounds while recording just 13 defensive rebounds.</p>\n                <p>As Kieger said, \u201cUntil we develop this toughness and this grit to play defense, the results aren\u2019t going to change.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gracie Merkle\u2019s efficiency</p>\n                <p>6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle stands as one of the most efficient players in the country through 10 weeks, shooting 74.6% from the field.</p>\n                <p>Against both Big Ten squads last week, Merkle went a combined 17-for-23 as she tallied 42 points.</p>\n                <p>However, Merkle\u2019s biggest highlight from the game on Sunday was her free throw efficiency. With her strong, back-to-the-basket style of play, the Mount Washington, Kentucky, native has found her way to the free throw line for 59 shots this season.</p>\n                <p>Against Illinois, Merkle shot from the free throw line 10 times, going 8-for-10. Earlier in the year, she shot under 60% from the line, but has since gone over 60%.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Entering the second quarter down by eight, Penn State stormed back and outscored Ohio State 20-9 in the quarter.</p>\n                <p>After upsetting the then-No. 9 Buckeyes last year, the Lady Lions travel to Columbus to take them on again at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday with the same goal in mind.</p>\n                <p>This year\u2019s Ohio State team looks very different this year, missing its high scorer from last year. With WNBA scouts in attendance, Cotie McMahon scored 19 points on the blue and white last January before transferring to Ole Miss for her final year.</p>\n                <p>However, the Buckeyes were without Jaloni Cambridge \u2014 last year\u2019s No. 2 scorer and this year\u2019s leading scorer \u2014 due to an injury.</p>\n                <p>This year, she stands among the top scorers in the conference and 10th best in the nation, averaging 21.2 points per game.</p>\n                <p>In addition to Cambridge, Ohio State found success with Chance Grey and Kylee Kitts, who combine for 22.5 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Besides Grey, who scored 18 points on last year\u2019s Penn State team, much of the Buckeyes\u2019 starting lineup is new to coach Carolyn Kieger\u2019s squad and will get their first look on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>For the Lady Lions, however, their three primary starters played against Ohio State last year. Both Gracie Merkle and Moriah Murray played big roles in the team\u2019s upset, scoring 12 points each.</p>\n                <p>While Kiyomi McMiller didn\u2019t suit up for the blue and white last year against the Buckeyes, she was a strong contributor for Rutgers, scoring 14 points in her team\u2019s loss.</p>\n                <p>This year, that trio has led the Lady Lions on the court, averaging a combined 47.8 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Murray has been the blue and white\u2019s leading 3-point scorer for the past two seasons and is on pace to be in the top 10 for most triples in a season, currently having 46 made shots from behind the arc.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, Merkle made her way as the nation\u2019s most efficient shooter, shooting 74.6% from the court. McMiller rounds out the three with her strong ball-handling skills and playmaking, working her way to the basket when all else fails.</p>\n                <p>While Ohio State comes in towering over Penn State in the David versus Goliath matchup, the blue and white has the tools it needs to overtake Cambridge and the Buckeyes for its second straight upset and first conference win of the season.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State basketball started 0-3 in 2026, however the games were against three AP-ranked opponents, which boosts optimism as they move forward.</p>\n                <p>Here are three major takeaways from the most recent stretch of games where the blue and white faced then-No.20 Illinois, No. 2 Michigan and No. 5 Purdue.</p>\n                <p>Close, but no cigar</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions finished ten points in each of those games and even had a final possession against the Wolverines, with Freddie Dilione V just barely missing a shot on a questionable play call that Michigan easily snuffed out.</p>\n                <p>That sentiment echoes the trend of how the Nittany Lions play down the stretch, as experienced, higher-performing teams quickly derail any attempt by the blue and white to pull off an upset.</p>\n                <p>Against Illinois, the blue and white fell behind by 14 at the half and traded buckets with the Fighting Illini, but couldn\u2019t overcome the efficiency of its foe. Against Michigan, despite the Wolverines opening a path to victory by shooting over 10 percentage points worse after the break, the Nittany Lions still shot under 40% and struggled from beyond the arc and at the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Purdue contest marking an improved second-half shooting stretch, the blue and white dished out half as many assists and turned the ball over five times, while the Boilermakers turned it over once, again putting the win out of reach down the wire.</p>\n                <p>Tale of two shooters</p>\n                <p>In the early games of 2026, the Nittany Lions sought to improve their shooting from beyond the arc; a team that averaged 7.8 threes per game surpassed that mark in this stretch of contests. That shooting came courtesy of two main wings, Eli Rice and Dominick Stewart, who ramped up their willingness to empty the clip from downtown.</p>\n                <p>Rice posted a season high in shot attempts over the stretch, while Stewart also surpassed his averages for field goals and three-point attempts per game in two of the contests. Both the 3-and-D players posted mixed results despite their newfound willingness to shoot.</p>\n                <p>Stewart, over the three games, shot 2-for-18 from the field and committed 12 fouls, while Rice went 10-for-23 with six long-range makes.</p>\n                <p>Via Evan Miyakawa\u2019s statistical formulas, Stewart ranks as the least efficient and worst-performing Nittany Lion with over 200 possessions. On the contrary, Rice ranks fourth on the squad in performance and posts the best defensive rating.</p>\n                <p>Introduction to injury</p>\n                <p>In two of the three games Penn State played, it did so without star freshman guard Kayden Mingo, who reportedly suffered a broken nose in practice. That absence raised concerns among the blue-and-white fanbase, as most of the Nittany Lions' on-court identity is from Mingo.</p>\n                <p>The Farmingdale, New York, native provides all-around skills: playmaking, scoring, defense and leadership, yet the difficulty without him didn\u2019t seem to be much greater than with his services, as Penn State still posted formidable results.</p>\n                <p>It does mark the first major injury for Penn State this season, and he\u2019s joined on the sidelines by Tibor Mirti\u0107, who appeared on the availability report before the Purdue game after exiting against Michigan.</p>\n                <p>The last injury report for Penn State men\u2019s basketball marked the lengthiest it\u2019s been so far this season.</p>\n                <p>Both the guard and forward likely miss extended time for Penn State, and navigating a less-than-full-strength roster is essential for Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad, as it looks to build a foundation and confidence on the court outside of its budding superstar.</p>\n                <p>Over the past week of play, Penn State seems to have started strongly toward that goal, which should result in a stronger team once everyone is available.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>While Penn State fell to Illinois to continue its six-game losing streak, the Big Ten saw several other storylines in the past week of conference play.</p>\n                <p>From top-25 showdowns to busted win streaks and continued losing streaks, many teams had their fair share of highlights and big games.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a recap of the conference action this week.</p>\n                <p>USC falls to Oregon, Minnesota</p>\n                <p>USC has looked like a different team this year without JuJu Watkins, and that was on display even more this past week.</p>\n                <p>Entering the week as No. 21 in the AP poll, the Trojans fell to two unranked teams in Oregon and Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>USC pulled into a commanding 23-9 lead after the first quarter against the Ducks, and that was extended even more to a 16-point lead at half. However, Oregon flipped the script in the final quarter, outscoring USC 26-8 to win the game.</p>\n                <p>Against the Golden Gophers, Jazzy Davidson \u2014 the No. 1 athlete in the Class of 2025 \u2014 scored 21 points alongside senior Kara Dunn\u2019s 27 points.</p>\n                <p>The team\u2019s bench was the ultimate letdown, however, scoring just three points.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota\u2019s Grace Grocholski and Sophie Hart combined for 40 to win 63-62, sending USC to the middle of the Big Ten with a 2-3 conference record.</p>\n                <p>Purdue beats Wisconsin, Washington</p>\n                <p>Following three straight losses, Purdue found some hope to rejuvenate its season with a pair of upset wins over Wisconsin and Washington.</p>\n                <p>The Boilermakers had a disappointing start to the season, losing to their satellite campus Purdue Fort Worth and to Central Michigan. However, they showed signs of strength in their two wins that could carry deeper into the season.</p>\n                <p>Purdue pulled out to a commanding 18-9 lead after the first quarter to Wisconsin, and despite the Badgers closing the gap to one point at halftime, closed out the game while outscoring Wisconsin by seven points in the second half.</p>\n                <p>A big part of Purdue\u2019s success came from the triple, as it went 12-for-20 from deep. Sophomore Nya Smith led the way with four 3-pointers, followed by Madison Layden-Zay\u2019s three triples.</p>\n                <p>The first quarter played out a little differently against Washington, however, as Purdue entered the second quarter down by nine points.</p>\n                <p>While junior Sayvia Sellers scored 23 points against the Boilermakers, they were able to bring the game to overtime tied at 63 each.</p>\n                <p>Layden-Zay and Tara Daye put the nail in the coffin in overtime, each scoring 19 points on the game to win by six \u2014 tying USC with 10 wins on the year.</p>\n                <p>No. 19 Ohio State earns upset over No. 8 Maryland</p>\n                <p>After falling to No. 1 UConn and No. 4 UCLA earlier in the year, Ohio State earned its first big win of the year as it handed Maryland its second loss of the year.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins came out of the first quarter shooting 60% from deep with a 24-12 lead over Ohio State. However, the Buckeyes scored 28 points in the second and fourth quarters to win by 13 points.</p>\n                <p>Jaloni Cambridge continued to craft her second straight All Big Ten season, scoring 28 points on Maryland.</p>\n                <p>Kylee Kitts, Kennedy Cambridge and Chance Grey all scored double digits as well, combining for 43 points.</p>\n                <p>Despite the loss, Maryland\u2019s Oluchi Okananwa scored 27 points, recording over 20 points for the fifth time this year.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

UCLA\u2019s last two games against Wisconsin and Maryland will be Penn State's next two opponents after this game.</p>\n                <p>On the surface, scouting the Bruins, they remain a daunting foe at 11-5 overall, with a 3-2 conference record and an undefeated home streak after 10 games.</p>\n                <p>Bogged down Bruins</p>\n                <p>As the initial scouting report for UCLA presents, it doesn\u2019t possess many flaws, with a top-half conference offense and defense. The Bruins\u2019 +9.8 point scoring differential is a top-10 figure in the conference, despite their scoring average being the sixth lowest in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>These figures indicate a slower tempo and an efficient offensive approach from the Bruins, who rank sixth in the conference in field goal percentage. UCLA averages 70 possessions per game, placing it outside the top 240 teams nationally.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions, who hold a slightly worse scoring offense but a much less effective defense, rank only somewhat behind the Bruins in possessions per game.</p>\n                <p>Luckily for the blue and white UCLA typically averages fewer offensive touches with the ball when they\u2019re away from home, and is heading to Happy Valley, where Penn State ranks similarly to UCLA in their top level of play at home.</p>\n                <p>Evan Miyakawa\u2019s formulas state that UCLA is a consistent team that plays the same regardless of the level of competition and pace. That tempo is again where a differential may emerge; however, the Bruins hold a bottom-six Big Ten tempo rating, while Penn State ranks in the top six.</p>\n                <p>The two coaching styles clash at the BJC, yet only one can prevail.</p>\n                <p>Participating personnel</p>\n                <p>Both Mike Rhoades and UCLA coach Mick Cronin\u2019s units dealt with significant recent injuries, and that trend continues into this week\u2019s clash.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s star and leader on the court, Kayden Mingo reportedly broke his nose in practice and won\u2019t play against the Bruins barring any significant change in status. The Penn State second-highest in scoring, and leader in assists, missed his second consecutive game as Penn State listed him and Tibor Mirti\u010d on the last availability report.</p>\n                <p>Mirti\u010d played all 15 games before his first absence this season, and Rhoades didn\u2019t provide an immediate update on his status.</p>\n                <p>The Bruins listed senior guard Skyy Clark as out in their last contest, as well as wing Brandon Williams. Clark stands as UCLA\u2019s second leading scorer and started in all but one of his 14 appearances, while Williams averages double-digit minutes as a valuable bench two-way contributor.</p>\n                <p>Clark dealt with a hamstring injury in the last few games, and before the previous contest, he got upgraded to day-to-day, meaning his return is inevitable and may even occur against Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Williams may also return soon, as his status is day-to-day due to leg cramps.</p>\n                <p>For UCLA, its leading scorer this season is senior forward Tyler Bilodeau, who averages 17.5 points, shoots the lowest field goal percentage out of its players who average double digits and scored a season high of 34 this year.</p>\n                <p>Joining Sky and Bilodeau are three other double-digit scorers for the Bruins, including Eric Dailey Jr., who leads the squad with 5.9 rebounds per game.</p>\n                <p>Dailey Jr transferred to UCLA after committing to Oklahoma State out of the 2023 class from IMG Academy, the same school and class that Penn State\u2019s Eli Rice came out of and joined Nebraska before heading to Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Over the last four games, Rice has averaged 11.75 points per game and has reached over 20 minutes in each game of that stretch, as he puts together a breakout campaign.</p>\n                <p>Also stepping up over that stretch, and in particular once Mingo went down, is Dilione, who averages a team high 15 points per game, and orchestrates the offense with his desired tempo.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",
