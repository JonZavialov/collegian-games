    "title": "Breaking down Luke Lilledahl\u2019s competition at 125 pounds for potential postseason run",
    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s Luke Lilledahl is the top-ranked wrestler in the 125-pound weight class this year. After finishing third in the 2025 NCAA tournament, Lilledahl will look to win his first national championship this March.</p>\n                <p>However, despite being the top seed, the path to glory will be anything but smooth for the sophomore. Lilledahl faces a field of familiar faces and differentiating styles in college wrestling\u2019s lightest weight class.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl\u2019s most recent opponent, Nic Bouzakis of Ohio State, is viewed as the toughest matchup for Lilledahl in the class. While Lilledahl defeated him in the Bryce Jordan Center, Bouzakis was dealing with an injury entering the contest. On top of that, he has been splitting time at the weight class while dealing with the effects of cutting weight.</p>\n                <p>Bouzakis competed at 133 pounds last season. Bouzakis has many impressive wins on the year, including a pinfall over Dean Peterson of Rutgers and a tech fall against Maryland\u2019s Abram Cline two days after the Penn State dual.</p>\n                <p>When healthy, Bouzakis matches up in a unique way with \u201cLightning Luke.\u201d While Lilledahl is known for his speed, Bouzakis is known for power at 125. A match between these two can go either way depending on which skill aspect gains the advantage.</p>\n                <p>Behind the Buckeye is defending national champion Vincent Robinson. The NC State lightweight broke out at the end of his freshman year, making a shocking run through the NCAA tournament in Philadelphia. This season, the results haven\u2019t come as easy. He sits at 11-3 after a loss to Eddie Ventresca.</p>\n                <p>Speaking of Ventresca, the Virginia Tech junior has turned on the ignition in 2026 after a slow start to his season in the fall. Lilledahl defeated Ventresca in the consolation semifinals in 2025, but Ventresca has defeated every top-15 opponent he\u2019s faced since then. The Hokie is known for competing in low-scoring matches this season, with five of his victories coming by four points or less.</p>\n                <p>Ventresca\u2019s latest tight win came in sudden victory against Troy Spratley of Oklahoma State. Last year\u2019s national runner-up has struggled in big matchups this season, to the tune of a 2-3 record against top-16 foes. The combo of Spratley and Robinson reaching last year\u2019s national finals emphasize the unpredictability of the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Sitting sneakily behind the top of the class is Peterson, who bested Lilledahl last season, 4-1, in a slow match. This season, Paterson has defeated every opponent he\u2019s faced outside of Lilledahl and Bouzakis.</p>\n                <p>One of the most unpredictable upsets in the tournament last season came at the expense of Lilledahl, when Lehigh\u2019s Sheldon Seymour refused to let Lilledahl move in the tiebreaker to close off a semifinal stunner. This season, Seymour hasn\u2019t lost a match. A revenge match is still on the cards for Lilledahl, as Seymour was scratched from Lehigh\u2019s dual against Penn State early this season.</p>\n                <p>Seymour is 4-0 against top-16 wrestlers, but none of those opponents were ranked in the top-10 at the time of the bout. All of those wins were by decision, with his highest touted being a 9-6 victory over Stevo Poulin of Iowa State. If Lilledahl matches up with Seymour again, he will have to avoid letting Seymour stall as much as he did last year.</p>\n                <p>Being a sophomore with a year under his belt, Lilledahl has shown more confidence in pushing opponents in matches like that, with his victory over Bouzakis being a prime example of what to expect out of him in this year's national championship.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

Past headliners have included The Fray, Walk The Moon and Bea Miller.</p>\n                <p>Here are predictions for what surprise act will rock the Bryce Jordan Center stage this THON Weekend.</p>\n                <p>Imagine Dragons</p>\n                <p>It is impossible to create a pump-up, dance playlist without adding at least one of Imagine Dragons\u2019 hit songs. With bangers like \u201cBeliever\u201d and \u201cThunder,\u201d it is hard to not pump your fist along with the pop rock band.</p>\n                <p>With the resurgence of 2016 culture and music in 2026, Imagine Dragons will pack the throwback punch needed to keep dancers moving.</p>\n                <p>Surfaces</p>\n                <p>A feel good sound to recharge spirits during the long THON weekend, Surfaces is the perfect pick to brighten up the stage. Although the duo has been laying low in recent years, they have posted hints about the possibility of new music, and what better place is there to drop a preview than the Bryce Jordan Center?</p>\n                <p>Hits like \u201cSunday Best\u201d and \u201cCome With Me\u201d express the warm fuzzy feelings entering the community\u2019s hearts over the 46 hour weekend.</p>\n                <p>Djo</p>\n                <p>How does his hit song, \u201cEnd of Beginning,\u201d go again? \u201cAnd when I'm back in the BJC, I feel it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Maybe that\u2019s not right, but even so, Joe Keery, known for his role as Steve Harrington in \u201cStranger Things\u201d would definitely turn the stadium upside down.</p>\n                <p>Keery is also no stranger to performing for a good cause, donating proceeds of ticket sales for his \u201cAnother Bite Tour\u201d to the Ally Coalition, a cause supporting LGBTQ+ youth.</p>\n                <p>Audrey Hobert</p>\n                <p>This rising star, known for being close friends with fellow pop icon Gracie Abrams, released her debut album \u201cWho\u2019s the Clown\u201d in 2025. Her songs \u201cSue Me\u201d and \u201cBowling Alley\u201d quickly launched her into the spotlight, gaining considerable traction on social media platforms like TikTok.</p>\n                <p>Her songs are hard not to dance along to, although many dancers may wish they were in their bedrooms singing along with a hairbrush.</p>\n                <p>Bruno Mars</p>\n                <p>Definitely a long shot, but with the release of his new album \u201cThe Romantic\u201d at the end of February, it would be a great chance to show off what he\u2019s got. The first song released from the album, \u201cI Just Might,\u201d is a peppy pick-me-up ready to rejuvenate the BJC.</p>\n                <p>With his tour not starting for another few months, Mars has just enough time to pause the press tour and finesse a performance for THON.</p>\n                <p>Colbie Caillat</p>\n                <p>The prediction I am most confident in is Colbie Caillat, a two-time Grammy Award winning singer-songwriter, known for her early 2000s hits \u201cBubbly\u201d and \u201cRealize.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Her most successful single, \u201cBubbly\u201d perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being at THON: \u201cI've been awake for a while now, you've got me feeling like a child now.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State dominated Atlantic Hockey America with a 22-2 conference record, earning itself the first-place seed and a pair of byes in the upcoming AHA Tournament. The Nittany Lions have only lost to No. 13 Mercyhurst, the No. 2 seed, and unranked RIT, the No.4 seed, both in overtime.</p>\n                <p>Although postseason action begins on Thursday as No. 6-seeded Robert Morris takes on No. 7-seeded Delaware, Penn State will kick off its tournament play in the semifinals on Feb. 27.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s advantage</p>\n                <p>Penn State has ruled the AHA for the past three years, capturing three consecutive championships. Part of this advantage is due to being well-rested after a bye straight to the semifinals.</p>\n                <p>But the blue and white aren\u2019t the only team to be on the verge of a championship berth. Mercyhurst got a pass into the other semifinal game due to its second-place finish in the regular season.</p>\n                <p>The Lakers, the first AHA team to defeat the Nittany Lions this season, are the only other team in the conference to be nationally ranked and are fighting for a spot in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Penn State, maintaining the No. 4 position in the national rankings, has likely earned itself a spot in the national tournament regardless of the AHA Playoffs results. The only way another team from the conference could make the national tournament would be to win the AHA Championship and mount an upset over the Nittany Lions in the process.</p>\n                <p>The path to Pegula</p>\n                <p>In order to face Penn State in the conference semifinals, the winner between Delaware and Robert Morris has to face No. 3-seed Lindenwood in the quarterfinals. The other quarterfinal game is set to be between RIT and No. 5-seed Syracuse.</p>\n                <p>The lower-seeded team that makes it out of the quarterfinals has a date with the Nittany Lions in Pegula Ice Arena. Meanwhile, the team with the higher seeding will head to Erie, Pennsylvania, to face Mercyhurst.</p>\n                <p>In the opening round and quarterfinals, teams only play a single game to decide who advances. Once in the semifinals and championship rounds, winners are decided in a best-of-three series structure.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white \u2014 while far-and-away the top team in the conference, with 68 points in the standings \u2014 aren\u2019t unbeatable, especially when stacked up against hungry teams that aim to knock the Nittany Lions off their throne.</p>\n                <p>Players to watch</p>\n                <p>Grace Outwater paces the conference with 24 goals, shortly followed by captain Tessa Janecke and linemate Maddy Christian, who\u2019ve each tallied 19. Janecke missed a stretch of action due to Olympic duties with Team USA and is set to return in the AHA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Kendall Butze was the top playmaker for the Nittany Lions, registering 25 assists on the season to pace the defensemen in that figure. Mikah Keller, known for her position as the tactician on Outwater and Christian\u2019s line, only sits one behind Butze, with 24.</p>\n                <p>Lindenwood\u2019s Molly Henderson and Robert Morris\u2019 Alaina Giampietro are the highest-scoring non-Penn Staters with 16 goals each.</p>\n                <p>However, the Colonials\u2019 offensive ace, Jessica MacKinnon, ranks tied for second in the conference with 39 points, matching Outwater and only one shy of Janecke\u2019s 40 points. MacKinnon, a sophomore transfer from Clarkson, is a playmaking forward, posting 25 asesists and 14 goals to help on all fronts.</p>\n                <p>Julia Perjus and Sofia Nuutinen are Mercyhurst\u2019s top performers. Perjus, a freshman from Stockholm, leads the Lakers with 36 points, good for fourth in the conference. If she\u2019s the shot, then Nuutinen is the pass, as the Vantaa, Finland, native paces Mercyhurst with 23 assists.</p>\n                <p>Ava Drabyk, a true-freshman netminder, is Syracuse\u2019s defensive backbone. In her first collegiate campaign, the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, native posted a .925 save percentage, a 2.32 goals-against average, which place third in the AHA. Drabyk has also posted four shutouts, second in the conference.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ryan Clanton made it abundantly clear the kind of coach and leader he is in the two months following his move to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The first indication was an X post from the Nittany Lions weight room that read \u201cREADY TO RUN THROUGH A WALL FOR THIS PLACE.\u201d The second was a beer chug in Pegula Ice Arena. And the third came when he spoke with the local media for the first time.</p>\n                <p>Clanton said his philosophy as a coach is \u201coverall violence.\u201d His goal has always been to let the front five hit the grass on Saturdays with nothing on their minds except the desire to attack whoever is in front of them.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI just want to cut them loose. They'll know what I'm saying when I say that, you know, let those guys really go,\u201d Clanton said on Feb. 4. \u201cAnd that's the big battle with offensive line. If you can get those guys to play really fast and play fearless and to be feared, that's when you've got a really good group.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offensive line was \u2014 like the rest of the team \u2014 supposed to be one of the best in the country last season. But a poor start to the year cost the unit, and it only came close to its potential near the end of 2025.</p>\n                <p>Clanton said the Nittany Lions\u2019 offensive line last year featured plenty of talent, but he feels they were too in their heads. Sometimes that was to their benefit, but oftentimes it resulted in one or two small missteps that can\u2019t happen,he said.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou're going to need to analyze in this conference and the people you're going against,\u201d Clanton said, \u201cbut a big part of it too is like, when you're playing against guys like that, even from my experience, you're going to have to play fast and you're going to have to catch them off guard.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Clanton\u2019s philosophy and coaching style is different from what Penn State experienced last year under Phil Trautwein, so Clanton said guys like Anthony Donkoh and Cooper Cousins are going to have to adjust their techniques and learn more gap schemes.</p>\n                <p>But what Clanton won\u2019t have to teach them is to be violent.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Donkoh), Coop, those guys have some bad intentions,\u201d Clanton said. \u201cThe way that they can get off the rock and kind of run through something, you know, and then we'll have to kind of see everybody else as we kind of go through it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Donkoh and Cousins were two of the first few players to announce they\u2019d return to Penn State for 2026, but it took them wanting to stay and Clanton believing they\u2019re a good fit for his group to make that happen.</p>\n                <p>Clanton\u2019s criteria was simple, and similar to the entire coaching staff\u2019s ideology when building the 2026 roster. He wanted humble leaders who bleed for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou'll find guys that are like, \u2018I play (offensive line) because I love football, I love this team. I bleed for that logo, and I want to run through somebody's face.\u2019 And you\u2019re like, \u2018I can work with that,\u2019\u201d Clanton said. \u201cSo that's the first thing, when you kind of talk to guys, I try to find out the real reason why they play football and why they're here.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Through just over two months learning more about the guys in his unit, Clanton is most impressed with their willingness to learn from someone new as they all try to make the most of this adjustment period.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSometimes you come in and you'd see (guys say) \u2018well I've already been here for this long and, so just manage me.\u2019 None of them are like that,\u201d Clanton said. \u201cAnd I couldn't coach them anyway if they were like that. So they've been really adapting to the new tips and tricks and new techniques, lifting, diet, supplementation. I think that's what's made them fun to coach, that they're eager to grow.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Carolena Bongi | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>As freezing temperatures settle over campus, Penn State students are reaching for their long winter coats and scarves to battle the cold. But that doesn\u2019t stop students from still showing up to class in style.</p>\n                <p>For Caya Kassaraba, winter fashion starts with pieces that elevate her everyday outfits.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy go-to winter staple this season has been a scarf and a good pair of jeans,\u201d Kassaraba, a second-year student studying elementary and early childhood education, said.</p>\n                <p>Kassaraba said she plans her outfits so they are practical and chic, rather than sacrificing one for the other.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOne way I balance staying warm and expressing my personal style is by layering and wearing my winter coat,\u201d Kassaraba said. \u201cThis allows me to stay warm when outside but still express my style once I get inside.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kassaraba said she refuses to trade in her jeans, even on the cold days. Although she\u2019s considered wearing sweatpants for their extra warmth, she still sticks with the denim because she believes that looking good helps her feel good.</p>\n                <p>Jillian Shortridge said winter dressing is about making small adjustments.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI am definitely a spring, summer girl, so most of my tops are tanks, which is tough during the winter,\u201d Shortridge, a fourth-year studying plant sciences, said. \u201cBut I love throwing on this knit cropped sweater so I can still show the tank top\u2019s pattern but stay warm while doing so.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lucy Ann Hinkle said she sees winter style centers around a statement accessory.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy most-used winter item is my cream cable-knit scarf because it\u2019s long and wide enough that I can wrap it around my head like a hood to keep warm without earmuffs,\u201d Hinkle, a second-year majoring in health policy and administration, said.</p>\n                <p>Hinkle said even when she dresses for the colder weather, she keeps the core of her style intact. She chooses winter pieces that match the colors she typically gravitates toward, and always incorporates jewelry she already enjoys wearing.</p>\n                <p>She also gravitates toward bold outerwear.</p>\n                <p>\u201cColorful and textured jackets or sweaters add a lot to my simple daily-wear winter outfits,\u201d Hinkle said.</p>\n                <p>For Abby Roniger Alarcon, winter style is all about timeless outerwear.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy go-to winter staple is a cropped trench coat,\u201d Roniger Alarcon, a third-year majoring in public relations, said. \u201cThere\u2019s this sound on TikTok, \u2018trench coat buttoned to the top,\u2019 and that really inspired me because it kind of channels Lily-Rose Depp vibes and I feel like it goes with everything while also being aesthetic and timeless.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said layering is the foundation of her outfits because it allows her to add warmth underneath while still styling a more intentional look on top. She added that even when she is bundled up, her accessories help her to maintain her personal style.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you get a bag that you adore, it can change everything, even if you\u2019re wearing something simple, a cute bag pulls the whole outfit together,\u201d Rongier Alarcon said.</p>\n                <p>She\u2019s been enjoying the way scarves and gloves have become more stylish on campus. She said when she was younger, those pieces weren\u2019t considered fashionable, but now students are wearing them in ways that enhance their outfits.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, even in freezing temperatures, she refuses to give up ballet flats.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you wear them right, they can bring every outfit together and no matter if it\u2019s two degrees, I\u2019m not willing to sacrifice my flats. Ballet flats are a lifestyle,\u201d Rongier Alacron said.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

Gadowsky lamented the loss of Dowiak, not only for his leadership, but also for his gritty playstyle alongside linemates Aiden Fink and Gavin McKenna.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(It\u2019s) a tough one for us,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201c(Dowiak) is still our captain. He's still gonna be a huge part of the team. We didn't need to lose another centerman. He was our top guy in draws. But he's still our captain. He brings great value as a captain and a leader.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After a few weeks of trial and error, Gadowsky had settled on Dowiak to center a line with Fink and McKenna. Now, without his captain, Gadowsky must find a replacement to center his top offensive line.</p>\n                <p>A potential option is Luke Misa, who centered that line in Dowiak\u2019s absence.</p>\n                <p>Alex Servagno, Charlie Cerrato and Braeden Ford remain sidelined. Servagno and Cerrato will miss the remainder of the regular season, while Ford continues to recover from an injury that Gadowsky said will cause him to miss a \u201csignificant amount of time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Casey Aman, a traditional defenseman, has filled in at forward as the Nittany Lions look to their depth amid a plethora of injuries.</p>\n                <p>Navigating injuries</p>\n                <p>With Dowiak sidelined, Penn State was without five of its forwards for the second half of Game 1 and all of Game 2 against Michigan.</p>\n                <p>It caused Gadowsky to get creative with his lines, using defensemen Nick Fascia and Aman at forward and, at one point, deploying a line with four defensemen and just one forward.</p>\n                <p>But the long-time coach doesn\u2019t want to change the way his team plays. He doesn\u2019t want to change the \u201cstripes\u201d that have molded Penn State hockey into the tough, gritty team that\u2019s ranked No. 6 in the nation.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe change personnel because we have to, but we don't want to change our stripes, because to change your stripes takes months,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cYou don't just come in and say, \u2018Hey, for this team, we play like this now. If you\u2019ve heard the adage, \u2018We only ran two plays all year, we just ran them better than anybody else,\u2019 we absolutely agree with that. We're not changing this team. We have our stripes, and that's how we play.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Laubach\u2019s surge</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s forward group has been depleted by injuries, but one goal scorer has surged in recent weeks.</p>\n                <p>After tallying six goals in his first 24 games, Laubach has scored five times over his last five games, including a two-goal effort in the Nittany Lions\u2019 6-3 loss to Michigan on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe are extremely proud of Reese. He does whatever the team asks in whatever role is asked. And it's guys like that, that when they have offensive success, everybody's happy,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe's a really tough kid.

    "description": "<p>Over the weekend, Penn State softball headed down south to the Lone Star State for their second weekend series, the Houston Invitational.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions went 4-1 over the course of five games against nonconference opponents.</p>\n                <p>Falling short in their opening match of the weekend to then undefeated Incarnate Word, 5-4.</p>\n                <p>Quickly bouncing back after a walkoff loss, Penn State faced off against the host team, the Houston Cougars, their second undefeated team of the weekend.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were able to close out the game in six innings, ending it 10-2.</p>\n                <p>Securing a Saturday sweep, the Nittany Lions traveled over to Husky Field to take on Lafayette and Houston Christian. Getting their second run-rule victory of the season, the blue and white ended their first game of the day in five innings after 14-1.</p>\n                <p>Then defeating the Huskies 4-1on their home field, to end their second day of the Houston Invitational. Facing off against in-state rival Pitt, the blue and white had an astounding second inning, scoring eight runs that ultimately gave the win.</p>\n                <p>Closing out their weekend in Texas in five innings, beating the Panthers 11-2.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Spotlight: Allison Onearce</p>\n                <p>True freshman Allison Onearce was the highest-ranked individual prospect in Penn State\u2019s 2025 signing class. Her performance in the blue and white jersey has been nothing less than straight dominance.</p>\n                <p>Receiving honors of Big Ten Freshman of the week and D1 Softball and Softball America National Freshman of the week after just her second full week as a collegiate athlete.</p>\n                <p>The Alpharetta, Georgia native has had a sensational showing, leading the Nittany Lions to a 4-1 weekend in Houston. Mustering a .407 batting average on the year, a new team high of six home runs, highlighted over this weekend with her eight total bases against Incanate Word.</p>\n                <p>Onearce is in the top 30 of the Big Ten conference overall players with her six homers and .407 batting average. Establishing herself as one of the most prominent power hitters in all of D1 this early in the season.</p>\n                <p>Offense sets the tone</p>\n                <p>Throughout the weekend, what really stuck out for Penn State softball was the aggressive at-bat performances. Finding their rhythm at the plate, creating consistent contact across all five games.</p>\n                <p>Outsourcing opponents 33-9 throughout the weekend, the lineup from top to bottom produced on the plate, showcasing depth and balance throughout the order.</p>\n                <p>One of the blue and white's top performers was junior Brooke Klosowicz, who capitalized on opportunities on the plate across both games on Saturday. Finishing 4-for-5 with two runs scored, a home run and OPS of 2.233.</p>\n                <p>Sunday saw an impressive showing from sophomore center fielder Natalie Lieto, who had quality at-bats that helped drive the Nittany Lions' scoring. A 1-for-4 showing with 3 RBI and a home run.</p>\n                <p>Crushing Pitt for their final game of the weekend, it was powered by the hungry offense in the bottom of the second. Scoring eight runs that included three home runs. Fuelled by eight hits from seven different Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Command in the Circle</p>\n                <p>As the offense dominated the weekend, the Penn State pitching staff set a foundation throughout the Houston Invitational. Keeping opponents on a short leash and limiting momentum across the five games.</p>\n                <p>Bridget Nemeth had a complete game performance against Houston Christian, allowing only a single earned run. The junior from Glendora, California, had her first complete game, throwing all seven innings since May of 2024.</p>\n                <p>Left-handed pitcher, Brevyn Kellepouris, made her way to the circle as a reliever, picking up her first victory at the collegiate level on Sunday. Facing 13 batters, Kellepouris allowed only two hits while striking out two Panthers and allowing zero runs.</p>\n                <p>True freshman, right-hand pitcher Mackenzie Ducan received her second appearance of the series against the Cougars on Friday. With 2.2 innings in the circle, the rookie showed up with five strikeouts and finished the day with an earned run average of 2.63.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State was originally set on Noah Pauley to be its wide receiver coach in 2026, but plans had to change after Pauley left for an NFL job with the Green Bay Packers.</p>\n                <p>Nearly two weeks later, news broke that the Nittany Lions are set to hire Colorado State\u2019s Kashif Moore as their wide receivers coach to replace Pauley, filling out the last open position on Matt Campbell\u2019s first staff in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what to know about the expected new wide receivers coach.</p>\n                <p>Coaching history</p>\n                <p>Moore was only temporarily the pass game specialist and wide receivers coach with the Rams as he followed new head coach Jim Mora from UConn to Colorado State this offseason. He spent three seasons as the Huskies\u2019 wide receiver coach.</p>\n                <p>Moore helped UConn pass for 3,697 yards this past season with three wide receivers with over 400 receiving yards. In 2024, the Huskies\u2019 wideout room managed to tally 1,960 receiving yards.</p>\n                <p>Prior to his time with the Huskies, Moore was the wide receivers coach at Albany, which passed for 3,027 yards in 2022. He was the running backs coach at Cornell in 2021 after getting his first college job at Wesleyan University as wide receivers coach a year before.</p>\n                <p>Moore began his coaching career at Conard High School in Connecticut as an assistant coach from 2019-20.</p>\n                <p>Notable players coached</p>\n                <p>Throughout his last two seasons at UConn, Moore guided wide receiver Skyler Bell. Bell was a finalist for the 2025 Biletnikoff Award, which is given out annually to the nation\u2019s top pass catcher.</p>\n                <p>Bell appeared in 12 games this past season, totaling 101 receptions for 1,278 yards and 13 touchdowns. He had more than 100 yards in seven games, including a season-high 158-yard performance against Rice.</p>\n                <p>Bell\u2019s now going through the pre-draft process ahead of the 2026 NFL draft in April.</p>\n                <p>Another notable year under Moore was wide receiver TJ Sheffield, who had 54 catches for a career-high 505 yards along with three touchdowns with UConn in 2024, his sixth and final season after spending the first five at Purdue.</p>\n                <p>Playing days</p>\n                <p>Moore was a four-year player for UConn from 2008-11, where he had 126 catches for 1,699 yards and 13 touchdowns throughout his career, including a 604-yard senior year. His career-best game happened when he tallied 112 yards on eight catches against Western Michigan in 2011.</p>\n                <p>Moore also played in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl against Oklahoma, totaling 62 yards on four catches in a loss to the Sooners.</p>\n                <p>Following his college career, Moore signed with the Cincinnati Bengals as an undrafted free agent following the 2012 NFL draft. He also spent time with the Indianapolis Colts, San Diego Chargers, Houston Texans, Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs, but he never appeared in an NFL game.</p>\n                <p>Moore was last released by the Chiefs ahead of the 2016 season.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>After a very slow start to the Big Ten season with 11 straight conference losses, things have started getting better for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>With two weeks remaining until the conference tournament, the Lady Lions have won two of their last four games, feeling the best they have all year.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe just want to stack our days, one game at a time,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said during her weekly media session. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of carrying over from how we\u2019ve been playing the last two weeks, and obviously still continuing to fix the things that are weaknesses for us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The blue and white opened February with an overtime win against Purdue, earning its first victory since Dec. 20. After two close losses to ranked Michigan State and Maryland, the Lady Lions emerged victorious again, this time defeating Northwestern on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think everybody\u2019s mindset is very good right now,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe talk about getting better, learning and growing. I think everyone can see the team getting better day by day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A big contributor to the team\u2019s recent growth has been Kiyomi McMiller, who\u2019s had four of the best games of her career in recent weeks.</p>\n                <p>Starting with the team\u2019s win against the Boilermakers, McMiller has scored over thirty points in each of the last four games, marking the first Lady Lion in school history to reach that feat. Against Northwestern, the former Rutgers standout also recorded a double-double with 12 rebounds, marking her third of the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think Kiyomi is just super confident from all three levels right now,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cHer three-ball has been falling, but I think getting to the free throw line has drastically helped.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Not only has the amount of scoring from McMiller increased, but her efficiency shooting has significantly grown over the past few games. Up until the Purdue victory, McMiller was averaging 43% from the field. But in the past four games, she\u2019s shot at a much-improved 49.5%.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHer mid-range has been elite her entire career,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cShe\u2019s super confident, and you can tell she\u2019s playing free and clicking on all cylinders right now.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After winning on Sunday, the Lady Lions are in need of at least two wins to clinch the Big Ten tournament, barring any major upsets from lower-ranked teams. The first step to success is a matchup with Rutgers on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Penn State played the Scarlet Knights earlier this season, losing after leading for most of the game. With a month of reflection following the game, the Lady Lions are prepared for Rutgers this time around.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously, we had a lead, we built the lead, and they came back,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cA lot of it came down to the defensive rebounding and the physicality. So we\u2019re going to be talking a ton about physicality and hitting first.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Even with a win on Saturday, Penn State wouldn\u2019t be in the Big Ten tournament, needing different results from other teams. However, Kieger\u2019s squad isn\u2019t focused on the other teams\u2019 performances with the season on the line.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re obviously just focusing on what we can control,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe\u2019re controlling our own destiny right now.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Mike Rhoades says what Penn State must do to add top high school talent, reiterates need to get older",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State was a finalist for 5-star 2026 guard Dylan Mingo, but the highly ranked prospect ultimately committed to North Carolina as announced via ESPN on Tuesday.</p>\n                <p>Earlier this season, Mike Rhoades said Penn State isn\u2019t currently in a position to add the highest levels of talent out of high school, but he has a belief that the team will. He explained where that belief comes from and what has to happen in order to accomplish that while also reiterating the need for veteran players during his press conference on Monday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we got to continue to just keep pushing the envelope forward of men's basketball here in everything we do,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThat's the key to it, and when you bring recruits on campus and they see how awesome it is here, how much fun our student-athletes and our students are having here, the people you could be around, and you get a chance to play in the Big Ten. I mean, that's appealing. We got to continue to do our part, too.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Had Dylan Mingo committed to the Nittany Lions instead of the Tar Heels, he would\u2019ve become Penn State\u2019s highest-rated recruit in program history and helped Rhoades\u2019 efforts in building a successful basketball team in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were in the running for Dylan Mingo throughout his recruitment, too. He visited Penn State last September and is the younger brother of current freshman Kayden Mingo, who\u2019s having a standout year in his first season on the team.</p>\n                <p>Regardless, the Nittany Lions missed out on a potential program-changing commitment from Dylan Mingo. It\u2019s a miss in Penn State\u2019s high school recruiting, but Rhoades isn\u2019t always looking at the high school player pool as the transfer portal is also an option to find well-regarded prospects.</p>\n                <p>\u201cRecruiting has changed, and it's changing as we're speaking right now,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cYou always want to get high school talent, without a doubt, but you also make sure, like in the Big Ten, you got to be completely open to getting older all the time because that's what our league is doing, and that's what power-four teams are doing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s roster is the youngest in the Big Ten this season, and it\u2019s had to face teams like No. 1 Michigan. The Wolverines\u2019 starting lineup features five veteran players who were all once transfers.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s possible for the Nittany Lions to add impact players from the transfer portal, as they\u2019ve done before under Rhoades. Notably, center Yanic Konan Niederhauser came to Penn State in 2024-25 after two seasons at Northern Illinois before becoming a first-round pick in the 2025 NBA draft.</p>\n                <p>Guard Freddie Dilione V and forward Josh Reed both didn\u2019t begin their collegiate careers at Penn State but are having productive years as Nittany Lions this season. Wing Eli Rice, who transferred in from Nebraska ahead of the 2024-25 season, has shown promise as a sharpshooter as well.</p>\n                <p>Reed will run out of eligibility after this year, but Dilione and Rice both have the chance to return to Penn State in 2026-27 as redshirt senior and redshirt junior, respectively. Guard Dominick Stewart would be in his junior year, forward Sa\u0161a Ciani would be a senior, and the eight freshmen would all be in their second collegiate years.</p>\n                <p>Prior to any potential transfer portal movement and with the addition of incoming freshman Jamison White, the Nittany Lions\u2019 roster projects to have those 13 players in 2026-27.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps Penn State will make a push to find veteran talent in the portal this upcoming offseason, but whatever the case might be, the team won\u2019t have Dylan Mingo. Still, Rhoades knows the work needed to land instant-impact high school recruits in the future.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we have a really good staff that has great relationships with people,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI think we evaluate well. We recruit. The one thing about here at Penn State in the basketball program that we got to continue to work on is building our program in so many different ways to continue attracting those guys, those types of players like Kayden Mingo and like an Ivan (Juri\u0107) who could take your program through another level when you get a bunch of those guys.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>An open tournament was back in play for Penn State as multiple backup wrestlers competed in the Lock Haven Open. Some Nittany Lion transfers also continued their dual season with their respective new colleges.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look at the Nittany Lions, and wrestlers with Penn State ties, who competed over the weekend.</p>\n                <p>Lock Haven Open</p>\n                <p>Each of the five Penn State wrestlers competed unattached, not counting as a date towards potential redshirts.</p>\n                <p>At 141 pounds, Hayden Cunningham kicked off his day with a close 7-6 decision loss to Penn\u2019s Alex Almeyda. Cunningham was trailing entering the third period before an escape and takedown put him in the lead. Despite this, he allowed Almeyda to escape both times, giving the in-state foe the decision victory.</p>\n                <p>He responded with a 48-second fall before defeating CJ Carr of Lock Haven in the fifth-place match with an 8-0 major decision. Cunningham utilized a first-period takedown, and a third-period takedown sealed things for the Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>Up one weight class, Dalton Perry had a successful day at 149 pounds. Perry started with a 10-4 decision over Rutgers\u2019 Devon Magro after two takedowns in the opening period.</p>\n                <p>He followed it up with a 17-3 major decision over Buffalo\u2019s Justin Holly with three takedowns in the third period. In the semifinals, Perry saw a much different match \u2014 a 2-1 decision with the Nittany Lion\u2019s second first point coming on a penalty to Columbia\u2019s Rawson Iwanicki. Perry escaped from the bottom in the third period and didn\u2019t give up any other points to win 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Perry rolled in the finals, defeating Army\u2019s Easton Broxterman 8-2, winning with his offense rather than his defense from the semifinals.</p>\n                <p>At 157 pounds, Ty Watson competed and lost his opening match by a 5-0 decision. Watson responded with a 15-0 tech fall, almost getting the fall with four-nearfall points in the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>Watson cruised to the fifth-place bout defeating American\u2019s Cameron Milheim, 12-1, with another set of four-nearfall points in the third period. In his final match, Watson lost by fall at the 2:42 mark ending his run with a sixth-place finish.</p>\n                <p>Sean Degl at 174 pounds found no success in his weight class. He opened things with a 7-2 decision loss against Lehigh\u2019s Richie Grungo, conceding two takedowns.</p>\n                <p>In consolations, he lost to another Lehigh wrestler in Dom Federici in an 8-5 decision, finishing with an 0-2 record.</p>\n                <p>Mason Ellis competed at 197 pounds, but had to medically forfeit in his first match. He didn\u2019t compete in his second match, defaulting out of the open.</p>\n                <p>Transfers</p>\n                <p>Alex Facundo continued his strong first season with Oklahoma State. In the highly anticipated dual against Virginia Tech, Facundo defeated No. 30 Sergio DeSiante by a 4-1 decision, with his victory proving big in the overall dual match. The Cowboys ultimately defeated the Hokies 19-12.</p>\n                <p>At George Mason, Jack Kelly had a successful Senior Night weekend. In his match at 197 pounds against Clarion, Kelly won quickly in 1:47 by pinfall. He followed it up with a 17-5 major decision against Central Michigan to keep things rolling.</p>\n                <p>No. 7 David Evans has continued to show that it\u2019s back-to-back years with successful Penn State transfers at Utah Valley, with Terrell Baraclough being the wrestler a season ago. At 149 pounds, Evans won by tech fall twice in matches during Utah Valley\u2019s duals against Air Force and North Colorado.</p>\n                <p>Aurelius Dunbar has struggled with Duke. In the Blue Devils\u2019 dual against No. 8 NC State, Dunbar lost to unranked Will Denny by a 21-10 major decision. He\u2019ll likely need to overperform in the ACC tournament to qualify for the NCAA Championships.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Mercedes Hamilton | Editor-in-Chief",
    "description": "<p>When Audre Lorde argued that creativity is a form of power, in her 1977 essay \u201cPoetry is Not a Luxury,\u201d she was speaking to a lineage of Black writers who have shaped this country\u2019s moral compass.</p>\n                <p>For centuries, writing has transformed lived experience into record, resistance and survival in a country that has often refused to document the Black experience honestly. This refusal is not accidental; erasure and attempts to sanitize history are deliberate attempts to deny Black people humanity and legacy.</p>\n                <p>From Frederick Douglass\u2019 \u201cNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave\u201d to Harriet Jacobs\u2019 \u201cIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,\u201d Black writers have provided firsthand accounts of the egregious brutality of white slave owners in ways that are largely absent from public records, including sexual exploitation and denial of literacy.</p>\n                <p>Attempts to erase uncomfortable histories have real consequences for how Americans understand their country. At times, our lawmakers have acknowledged that federal and state institutions have failed to adequately preserve records of Black history since America\u2019s inception, prompting legislation such as the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation and Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act, which mandated the Archivist of the United States to preserve, digitize and publicize records from the aforementioned periods. Even still, history remains vulnerable to political agendas</p>\n                <p>Contemporary Black writers like Terrance Hayes and Angie Thomas explore generational grief, joy and identity in ways that push readers to grapple with a modern America that continues to navigate systemic racism. Works like \u201cAmerican Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin\" and \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d will live on as classics detailing modern-day police brutality and a resurgence of loud racism in a post-Obama America.</p>\n                <p>Black writers fill the gaps left by the enduring systemic neglect and denial of the realities of America\u2019s past and present. And they do it with courage. In spite of indifference and hostility.</p>\n                <p>On Jan. 22, the National Park Service removed an exhibit from Philadelphia\u2019s Independence National Historic Park that documented the lives of nine people enslaved by George and Martha Washington. It was part of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History\u201d executive order which directs national museums, parks and monuments to remove references that \u201cundermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.\"</p>\n                <p>The city of Philadelphia sued Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron, arguing that slavery is an integral part of the President House Site\u2019s history.</p>\n                <p>We will turn to Black writers to make sense of this erasure, just as we did during the Harlem Renaissance. During that cultural movement, poets and authors documented realities ignored by mainstream America.</p>\n                <p>Langston Hughes wrote poems and essays centered on everyday Black life from families to workers to artists. Zora Neale Hurston preserved Southern Black dialect, folklore and community life in \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d and other works.</p>\n                <p>During a time when popular culture reduced Black life to caricature and stereotype, Black writers portrayed communities filled with love and recorded joy and individuality, not just struggle.</p>\n                <p>Others, like James Baldwin, documented the emotional and social aftermath of segregation.

    "description": "<p>The Big Ten tournament is just two weeks away, and there\u2019s plenty of action as teams gear up for the final stretch.</p>\n                <p>Between top-25 matchups, the battle of Michigan and some big games by bottom-feeder teams, here\u2019s a look at the action across the Big Ten last week.</p>\n                <p>Top-25 matchups</p>\n                <p>All year long, the Big Ten has been one of the premier conferences in women\u2019s basketball. This week, seven teams ranked in the AP Top 25, including three in the top ten, and there were four games between ranked teams.</p>\n                <p>UCLA and Michigan State kicked off the week with a battle in East Lansing. Despite playing on the road, the Bruins earned a 23-point victory behind Lauren Betts\u2019 22 points.</p>\n                <p>That night, Washington traveled to the Midwest to Carver-Hawkeye Arena to try and upset struggling Iowa.</p>\n                <p>The Hawkeyes lost their three previous games \u2014 including two to unranked opponents \u2014 but emerged victorious with a nine-point win on Wednesday night. Chazadi Wright led the way with 21 points, followed by 14 from Hannah Stuelke and 11 from Ava Heiden.</p>\n                <p>Sunday afternoon marked the battle of Michigan, as the No. 7 Wolverines hosted the No. 13 Spartans.</p>\n                <p>The higher-ranked Wolverines earned the victory in their second matchup of the year, sweeping the series between the in-state foes. Syla Swords and Olivia Olson each scored over 20 points as Michigan won 86-65.</p>\n                <p>Maryland upset Ohio State</p>\n                <p>Among the top-25 matchups that didn't end in the higher-ranked team winning, No. 20 Maryland earned a big upset over No. 8 Ohio State to end the week.</p>\n                <p>Both teams had lost a handful of conference matchups heading into Sunday\u2019s game, including four straight losses from the Terrapins to end January. However, their three-game winning streak, including an upset of No. 12 Michigan State, propelled them past the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>A look at the biggest contributors would lead many to believe it was Ohio State in the win column, as Jaloni Cambridge and Chance Gray combined for 54 points.</p>\n                <p>Maryland, however, had four players in double-digit scoring in addition to Mir McLean\u2019s eight-point performance.</p>\n                <p>Yarden Garzon played all 40 minutes of the contest, tying for a Maryland-high 17 points alongside Oluchi Okananwa.</p>\n                <p>After being outscored 28-15 in the first quarter, the Terrapins had their own run to start the second half, closing the gap to just three points. Maryland went up 76-69 with two minutes left in the game, and despite not scoring the rest of the game, came out victorious, 76-75.</p>\n                <p>Bottom-tier teams stay alive</p>\n                <p>Despite only two weeks until the Big Ten tournament and several teams already clinching a spot, no one has been eliminated from the 15-team tournament.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers, Penn State, Northwestern, Indiana and Purdue are the bottom-five teams with the biggest chances to get cut.</p>\n                <p>However, the Lady Lions earned a much-needed victory over Northwestern on Sunday. On Saturday, Purdue earned its fourth conference win of the year over the Scarlet Knights, sending them to the bottom of the standings.</p>\n                <p>The Hoosiers and Wildcats were positioned for possible spots in the tournament in 15th and 16th places, but both went 0-2 this week.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern fell to Michigan and Penn State, while Indiana lost to USC and UCLA.</p>\n                <p>Currently, Northwestern, Penn State and Rutgers sit outside the Big Ten tournament, each with just a few games left in the season.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Weekly Recap | Pitching woes, newcomers highlight Penn State baseball\u2019s opening weekend",
    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State began its highly anticipated third season under coach Mike Gambino with a trip out west to Arizona for the MLB Desert Invitational. However, it was a rocky road trip for the Nittany Lions, finishing opening weekend 1-2, with both losses being blowouts.</p>\n                <p>After a scoreless tie over the first three innings, Air Force pulled away in the season opener with a 15-3 win. Penn State bounced back in its next game behind a productive offense and quality pitching with a 9-3 win over Grand Canyon.</p>\n                <p>Yet, the Nittany Lions couldn\u2019t carry their momentum into Sunday\u2019s 24-5 loss against Kansas State, as the game turned into a total rout.</p>\n                <p>Now, the blue and white have some areas to fix before the team travels again for a road series against Richmond this weekend.</p>\n                <p>Pitching Woes</p>\n                <p>The results from the mound weren\u2019t pretty for two of the three games. Redshirt senior Colin Fitzgerald had a solid first start as a Nittany Lion against Air Force. The Lititz, Pennsylvania, native allowed two earned runs, four hits and recorded three strikeouts over 3.1 innings. However, he also surrendered four walks, which drove up his pitch count.</p>\n                <p>As the anchor in Penn State\u2019s rotation, the blue and white likely need more innings in future starts. Junior Kyle Emmons was the only pitcher who didn\u2019t surrender any runs over 0.2 innings.</p>\n                <p>The game got out of hand when junior Mason Horwat took over. The Pittsburgh native threw two innings and surrendered five runs, two earned and four hits. While the right-hander didn\u2019t have his best outing, Penn State\u2019s defense didn\u2019t help as the squad finished with five errors.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Robert Brown III didn't have a smooth collegiate debut in one inning of relief. The North Andover, Massachusetts, native gave up four earned runs, along with three hits and two walks.</p>\n                <p>It was the same story against Kansas State, with the pitching staff allowing 21 hits and 22 earned runs. Freshman Isaiah Shayter got the start and threw 3.1 innings, allowing six runs, seven hits and three walks.</p>\n                <p>If Penn State\u2019s starters can\u2019t provide quality starts, the pressure turns on the bullpen to pitch most of the game, which can tire them out as the season progresses. Redshirt senior Frankie Sanchez was the lone pitcher to allow no runs against the Wildcats.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Matthew VanOstenbridge and freshman Braden Leed allowed four runs each, with Ostenbridge failing to retire any batter and Leed retiring just one. Mason Butash had another rough outing and surrendered six runs and six hits over 0.2 innings of work.</p>\n                <p>Penn State needs better production from its starters and bullpen to keep its offense in the game.</p>\n                <p>The Transfers</p>\n                <p>The one bright spot in pitching this weekend was sophomore Ben Hudson\u2019s start in the win over Grand Canyon. The West Virginia transfer delivered a quality start in his debut for Penn State, as he allowed just one run on two hits and one walk over five innings. The Medford, New Jersey, native also racked up six strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Hudson will be a key piece in Penn State\u2019s rotation, so his outing should make fans excited for future starts on the mound.</p>\n                <p>Vanderbilt transfer, senior Jayden Davis, delivered an impressive offensive debut throughout the weekend. As the blue and white\u2019s second baseman, the Cookeville, Tennessee, native totaled five hits and two RBI in 14 plate appearances.</p>\n                <p>With an infield full of many fresh faces, Davis may become an anchor in the diamond for the Nittany Lions as the year progresses.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After failing to win any January games, Penn State is experiencing a turnaround. The Lady Lions continued to improve this week, splitting their two games.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white suffered a 19-point loss against No. 20 Maryland, after trailing behind at just four at halftime. Penn State picked itself up with a 10-point win over Northwestern to earn its second conference victory of the season.</p>\n                <p>The McMiller show</p>\n                <p>With a 30-point showing against Maryland and 32 against Northwestern, sophomore guard Kiyomi McMiller has now posted fourth straight 30-point performances. The Silver Spring, Maryland, native has been a big part of the Lady Lions late season success.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, in the two games combined, McMiller recorded six assists, eight steals and 15 rebounds, all the while missing less than a minute of action in each contest.</p>\n                <p>After last week's performance, McMiller boosted her team-high scoring average to 21.0 points per game, while also pacing Penn State with 4.3 assists per game.</p>\n                <p>If McMiller\u2019s last few performances indicate anything, it\u2019s that she\u2019ll be the centerpiece to getting the Lady Lions to the Big Ten Tournament in Indianapolis.</p>\n                <p>Pink Zone victory</p>\n                <p>Sunday afternoon marked the 20th anniversary of Penn State\u2019s annual \u2018Pink Zone\u2019 game. In a day that was bigger than basketball, the Lady Lions fought hard for their second conference win over Northwestern.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white led for all but 24 seconds, and got up by as many as 20 points. The Wildcats had their chances to creep back, cutting the lead to as few as three late in the fourth quarter, but Penn State held its own.</p>\n                <p>Aside from McMiller, the Lady Lions had double-digit outings from redshirt juniors Gracie Merkle and Moriah Murray. Merkle was the team's second leading scorer with 19 points, 12 of which came in the second half. Murray finished with 14 points behind a 4-of-11 effort from beyond the arc.</p>\n                <p>Penn State shot a strong 46.7% from field goal range, while holding Northwestern to a 37.3% shooting percentage.</p>\n                <p>Despite being outscored by the Wildcats 49-45 in the second half, the Lady Lions\u2019 14-point cushion after the first half was enough to keep the game in their hands.</p>\n                <p>Opening strong, closing struggles</p>\n                <p>The biggest takeaway from Penn State\u2019s last two games was its ability to start quickly. On the other hand, the Lady Lions struggled in the second half in both contests.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white ultimately fell to No. 20 Maryland 81-62, but trailed 38-34 at halftime, and even had the slight 17-16 edge over the Terrapins after the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>Comparing the two halves against Maryland, Penn State shot 46.8% from the field in the first half, but that number fell to 35.7% in the second.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions kept the game close enough in the first half to trail by just eight after the third quarter, but the closing frame is where the game slipped away from the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was outscored 23-12 in the fourth quarter, and nine of those points came from McMiller. The Lady Lions shot 4-of-16 in the final frame, while turning the ball over six times. Maryland capitalized on the blue and white\u2019s shaky ending and scored 12 points off turnovers in the fourth quarter alone.</p>\n                <p>The final frame was the only one in the entire game where Penn State never held a lead.</p>\n                <p>Similarly, against Northwestern, the Lady Lions led 36-22 through two, but allowed the Wildcats to creep back late in the game.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white opened its Sunday afternoon matchup on a fast start, leading Northwestern 22-13 after the first quarter. Penn State forced seven Wildcats\u2019 turnovers, while committing just two of its own.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions had a strong third quarter, shooting 57.1% from the field, but allowed Northwestern to score 27 points, cutting the lead to nine heading into the final frame.</p>\n                <p>Penn State committed nine second-half turnovers, after just five in the first half. Sloppy offense allowed the Wildcats to come back and make it a one-possession game.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions' saving grace in the fourth quarter was taking 16 trips to the foul line, with just eight attempts from the field. The blue and white went 12-of-16 in this frame, which was enough to keep its lead intact.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

As such, the Nittany Lions have played only four games against their Pennsylvania rival.</p>\n                <p>The two teams first faced off in 2022 as Penn State won three consecutive games against Pitt.</p>\n                <p>The first and last wins for the blue and white came by eight points, while the second game was a much closer three-goal contest.</p>\n                <p>Last year, the Panthers earned their first win of the series in a 12-10 battle in Pittsburgh. The Panthers pulled ahead with an early 11-3 lead, but Penn State\u2019s five-goal fourth quarter wasn\u2019t enough to land in the victory column.</p>\n                <p>2026 Panthers</p>\n                <p>Pitt is having as good a start as the Nittany Lions, going 2-0 to start the year.</p>\n                <p>Unlike Penn State, Pitt\u2019s wins have been against a pair of strong teams. Its first win came against Ohio State, 10-13. On Thursday, the Panthers upset No. 14 Duke 17-10.</p>\n                <p>After losing the 2025 leading goal-scorer Jenna Hendrickson and No. 2 scorer Sydney Naylor to graduation, Pitt has worked to fill that void over the past week.</p>\n                <p>Junior Paige Telatovich has played a big role in the team\u2019s 2-0 start to the season, scoring seven goals and an assist. Outside of Telatovich, junior Avery Moon leads the team in points with six goals and four assists.</p>\n                <p>In the goal, senior Molly Cain has started for her second straight year, recording 18 saves and a 47.4% save percentage in the two wins.</p>\n                <p>Wednesday\u2019s matchup</p>\n                <p>After entering the top-25 in this week\u2019s IWLCA coaches\u2019 poll, Pitt has a lot to fight for to keep that ranking alive. However, the Nittany Lions have a lot to gain with the biggest game so far of coach Kayla Treanor\u2019s Happy Valley career.</p>\n                <p>The Syracuse alum has put a lot of trust into her squad, especially freshman Rocquette Allen. Through three games, Allen is the leading scorer, scoring 12 goals, the most on the team.</p>\n                <p>Outside of Allen, the blue and white have seen a lot of success all over the field. Between senior Erika Ho\u2019s six goals and five assists, the blue and white have no shortage of scorers. Ho, Payton Wainman, Kelly Mackinney, Allen and Greco all posted three-goal games over the stretch.</p>\n                <p>While Pitt has had success building a new identity this year, the Nittany Lions are hot in Year 1 with Treanor, building up for a big matchup on Wednesday in Panzer Stadium.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Avery Hill | Football Editor",
    "description": "<p>Defensive line coach Ikaika Malloe and defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn led a top-ranked defense at UCLA in 2023, and now they\u2019re set to give their shot at doing the same in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>The two\u2019s entrance into Happy Valley brings a multitude of changes \u2014 which, most importantly, is the unit\u2019s identity. The new scheme, and new era, in Happy Valley spells two key themes for the Nittany Lions within the trenches.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe are into eating up gaps and protecting (linebackers coach Tyson Veidt's) guys,\u201d Malloe said at National Signing Day media.</p>\n                <p>Once Malloe was hired, he brought in three defensive linemen listed as at least 310 pounds, including the 320-pound Keanu Williams and 310-pound Siale Taupaki from UCLA.</p>\n                <p>He additionally gets to coach Iowa State transfer Alijah Carnell, who he said has already added 15 pounds and will play on the inside in Happy Valley. It\u2019s a contrast from the Deion Barnes-led front that featured the 294-pound Zane Durant along with the 305-pound Alonzo Ford Jr as its starters.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe like two big defensive tackles,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cWe like playing four to five guys with all those guys we like being big, 300-plus pound guys.\u201d</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s still some parallels in the schemes, as Barnes went five-deep often in 2025 and guys like Durant were known for their abilities to free up others, but said trait is expected to mean even more under new leadership.</p>\n                <p>So far, Malloe has been impressed with his returns. The presence of Taupaki and Williams has added some comfort and foundation during install periods, and even the transfers Malloe has never coached seem to fit what he\u2019s looking to do at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDallas is one of the more athletic people at his size,\u201d Malloe said of Utah transfer Dallas Vakalahi. \u201cSo we\u2019re definitely going to use that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Malloe continued, \u201cArmstrong (Nnodim) from Oklahoma State, his teaching is very similar. The defensive line coach and coach Lynn are tied in together.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He even considered returnees Liam Andrews and Ty Blanding \u201creally impressive,\u201d and said they\u2019ll \u201ccompete\u201d during spring ball. Malloe also thinks Carnell, who\u2019s listed at 6-foot-5, will be something special with his size paired with athleticism.</p>\n                <p>The interior guys will be a part of the defense that should return to a 4-3 base look after running a 4-2-5 under former defensive coordinator Jim Knowles.</p>\n                <p>While Malloe placed a big emphasis on the advantages in the run game, the front\u2019s size is also something he knows will help his squad get to the quarterback. As part, Penn State hired former Northwestern defensive line coach Christian Smith to be its edge rushers coach.</p>\n                <p>The defensive ends, featuring returnees Yvan Kemajou and Max Granville along with Iowa State transfer Ike Ezeogu, will have a chance to be premier pass rushers. It\u2019s a role that Malloe compared to his former Bruin in Laiatu Latu, who won the Ted Hendricks Award after totaling 13 sacks in 2023.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCould\u2019ve been a center, could\u2019ve been a guard that Laiatu Latu\u2019d line up with, and everybody else would eat up for,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna find a way to get the Micah Parsons\u2019s of the world, the Abdul Carters of the world \u2026 on the fish of the week.\u201d</p>\n                <p>But whether it\u2019s in the pass or run game, the opportunity to open opportunities for others doesn\u2019t just come from the interior guys\u2019 ability to take on blocks, it also comes from football IQ.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEvery defensive lineman that I worked with can draw all 11 (players) on the board,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cThose guys understand schemes, to man pressure to zone pressure \u2014 they can draw them all up.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Said IQ also comes from experience, which Lynn and company made sure it had plenty of.</p>\n                <p>Taupaki\u2019s entering his eighth year in college football while Williams is headed into his sixth. Even Vakalahi, a junior, has played 499 defensive snaps in college football while Blanding saw 228 snaps in his redshirt sophomore campaign last season.</p>\n                <p>Still, production hasn\u2019t accompanied the unit's range of experience. Taupaki, Blanding and Nnodim tallied two tackles for loss each in 2025, the most among the 2026 Penn State interior defensive line.</p>\n                <p>But the good thing in Lynn\u2019s scheme is they don\u2019t need to stuff the stat sheet as the measurement of their success is rooted in a unit Penn State\u2019s prided itself on for decades.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is really built for linebackers to make plays,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cAnd if we can do our job, then we should have really, really good linebackers that are making tackles for losses over and over again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashlyn Kafer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Turning \u201cBrat\u201d summer into \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d winter, Charli xcx continues to bring innovation and the synthesis of sound into the mainstream flow of music with the release of her seventh studio album, \u201cWuthering Heights,\u201d on Friday.</p>\n                <p>The album was written for Emerald Fennell\u2019s movie adaptation of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, emphasizing the contemporary component of the film.</p>\n                <p>The first track on the album is \u201cHouse featuring John Cale.\u201d The lead single sparked a social media frenzy with many users creating edits from TV shows to the line \"I think I\u2019m going to die in this house.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The track begins with a steady, yet haunting violin melody and cello strums beneath the full-bodied voice of John Cale, before the amped-up vocals of Charli cut through the end of the number.</p>\n                <p>The orchestral element presented in this piece continues throughout the album, combining with the techno influence of Charli\u2019s typical pop-centric melodies to further modernize \u201cWuthering Heights.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The album continues to \u201cWall of Sound,\u201d introducing the overall theme of being consumed by love until it becomes all-encompassing, battling between knowing what\u2019s best for you and the desire for something more.</p>\n                <p>The subtly eerie violin drones are emboldened by deep bass tones and the surprisingly smooth vocals of Charli, as she comments on the pressures of love and desperately wanting someone to need her.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWall of Sound\u201d crescendoes into \u201cDying for You,\u201d sounding more like Charli\u2019s signature style on previous albums like \u201cSUCKER\u201d or \u201cPop 2.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The song is upbeat and infectious, though the lyrics utter something much more sinister, highlighting the need to keep seeking out love no matter if it feels like it\u2019s killing you, repeating \u201cI\u2019ll keep dying for you.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The album takes a turn with \u201cAlways Everywhere,\u201d utilizing less suspenseful and unstable sounding orchestral melodies, and instead emulating a wedding march as Charli sings of seeing signs of your lover at every end of nature.</p>\n                <p>Her vocals are more steady and reminiscent of a ballad, opposed to her usually short and quick singing style. The theme of going mad from the intoxicating essence of the love around you persists in this song's lyrics.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAlways Everywhere\u201d is followed by \u201cChains of Love,\u201d the second single from the album.</p>\n                <p>The piece is more bass forward, yet incorporates soft violins beneath Charli\u2019s lyrics, recounting the guilt of feeling like a prisoner in her relationship as the chains of love constrain her heart.</p>\n                <p>\u201cChains of Love\u201d feels like a track expected from Charli, though the following tracks \u201cOut of Myself\u201d and \u201cOpen up\u201d break up her traditional sound entirely.</p>\n                <p>Continuing to bring modernity into a period piece, Charli incorporates anticipatory sounding violins that stress feeling on the edge, like you\u2019re about to lose yourself in the love you\u2019ve been so desperate for, as \u201cOut of Myself\u201d implies.</p>\n                <p>Breaking her pop mold further, \u201cOpen up\u201d is a fairly short atmospheric and gut-wrenching piece. It\u2019s absolutely necessary to tell the story of the album and echo the devotion in \u201cWuthering Heights.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cOpen up\u201d listens like an ambient piece from singer-songwriter Ethel Cain, holding dual meaning as the lyrics beg for the receiving party to \u201copen up,\u201d leaving it up for interpretation whether it can be taken literally or metaphorically, such as opening up your heart or mind to another.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSeeing Things\u201d continues the \u201ccrazed by love\u201d storyline throughout the album, though the piece includes less elements than previous tracks. It\u2019s somewhat forgettable and falls short in comparison to the more enveloping sound present up until this point.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAltars\u201d juxtaposes jazz influence with harmonic orchestral sound, incorporating more raw sounding vocals from Charli. She sings about recognizing the toxic nature of her love before mixing the characteristic violin drones from previous tracks with the sultry vocals of Sky Ferreira on \u201cEyes of the World featuring Sky Ferreira.\"</p>\n                <p>The bass and drum hits work in opposition to the screeching violins, but it comes together to create an unstable and climactic tone, transitioning flawlessly into \u201cMy Reminder.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy Reminder\u201d mimics the feeling of moving on, recognizing faults and embracing forgiveness. Yet, with the inclusion of mildly frightening violin riffs in between the relatively normal bass-hit forward backtrack, it feels like being on the edge of wanting to fall back into the pattern of toxic devotion.</p>\n                <p>The album concludes with a standout track: \u201cFunny Mouth.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The piece accentuates the overall genius and originality of Charli xcx. Echoing the same haunting sounds heard in \u201cHouse featuring John Cale,\u201d she transforms them into powerful and hopeful beats, replicating coming out victorious at the end of a brutal romance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWuthering Heights\u201d is a display of Charli xcx\u2019s ability to inspire both freedom and thoughtfulness, moving people through her mastery of sound.</p>\n                <p>From the eerie sounds of violin scratches to swelling organ-focused ballads, Charli xcx expertly highlighted the equally intoxicating yet dreadful feeling of losing yourself to love, making an album that perfectly pairs with Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State closed the book on a historic regular season with a series against RIT last weekend. For the Nittany Lions, they got to do it in front of their fans inside Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Although Game 1 ended with a 3-2 overtime loss for the blue and white, over 1,400 fans came back the next day to witness a season finale 4-2 victory.</p>\n                <p>With their rebound win in Game 2, the Nittany Lions completed the regular season with a 22-2 conference record and a 29-5 overall record. Penn State ended another season leading the AHA in the standings.</p>\n                <p>Century mark Roberts</p>\n                <p>One of the major headlines coming out of the series against the Tigers was Katelyn Roberts earning her 100th career point. The Chanhassen, Minnesota, native finished the weekend with a goal and an assist, totaling a two-point series.</p>\n                <p>The forward\u2019s historic point came as she skated behind the goal line and fed a pass to Kendall Butze in the faceoff circle. The defenseman's shot was rebounded directly to a waiting Abby Stonehouse, who buried the first goal of Game 2.</p>\n                <p>Following her secondary assist on the play, Roberts is only the sixth player to earn 100 career points in program history.</p>\n                <p>She finished her senior season with a new career-high in goals at 15. She matched that number in assists and finished with 30 total points.</p>\n                <p>Maynard\u2019s first-year magic</p>\n                <p>Roberts wasn\u2019t the only player ending the season in the record books. Danica Maynard has climbed in the records in only her first year on the team. Although only recording an assist in the series against RIT, Maynard used that point to continue to climb in program history.</p>\n                <p>The defenseman made sure she was on the stat sheet for the better part of the season, as she currently holds the most single-season points by a defenseman with 31. Maynard is also tied in single-season goals by a defenseman with 9.</p>\n                <p>The Lake Country, British Columbia, native proved her two-way ability throughout the year, from positioning herself to score in the offensive zone to speedy backchecks to stay in front of oncoming breakouts.</p>\n                <p>With a historic first regular season with Penn State in the books, Maynard will look to continue to contribute on both the offensive and defensive sides as she heads into her first collegiate playoffs.</p>\n                <p>The look ahead</p>\n                <p>While there have been several records tied and broken, the regular season is behind the Nittany Lions, and another postseason is on the horizon. Penn State earned its fourth-straight conference title and will have home ice throughout the playoffs.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white will have to wait a week to hit the ice again as it has an upcoming bye after finishing as the highest seed. The Nittany Lions have possession of home ice throughout the AHA playoffs and would automatically enter the NCAA tournament with a championship win.</p>\n                <p>Although there isn\u2019t a solidified opponent or time yet, the certainty is that Penn State returns to Pegula on Feb. 27 for Game 1 of the three-game semifinals.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State ends its West Coast operations with a lone weekday Bryce Jordan Center clash against Rutgers, and it poses an opportunity for the Nittany Lions to pick up some steam as the season winds down.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have a favorable outlook for its return to Happy Valley and here\u2019s why.</p>\n                <p>Shared struggles</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and Rutgers are bottom-feeders in this year\u2019s Big Ten season. Both sit in the bottom five of the conference, with the Nittany Lions dead last due to tiebreaking head-to-head results.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights fare only slightly better, with their three Big Ten wins outpacing the blue and white by one, although Rutgers is the lone squad without an away conference win this season.</p>\n                <p>Both units have the same record, 2-8, over their last 10, and despite other marginal differences in the standings, these squads appear relatively level. KenPom has three Big Ten teams outside its top 100: Rutgers, Penn State, and Maryland.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins are sandwiched between the two, with over 20 spots separating them. While statistician Evan Miyakawa has the two teams narrowly battling for the bottom of the Big Ten in his formulas, ESPN predicts a 67% chance that Penn State will win.</p>\n                <p>There are multiple angles to predict who\u2019s winning this one, with the blue and white holding a slight advantage via the numbers. But no matter how you shake it, it\u2019ll be a close one, with the only uniformity being the shared struggles at the bottom of these two.</p>\n                <p>Player personnel</p>\n                <p>For the starting units of both squads, only one starter returns from last year\u2019s pair of clashes between the squads, which were split and both decided by within ten points.</p>\n                <p>Freddie Dilione V posted double-digit points in both outings he started against the Scarlet Knights last season. His playmaking and efficiency followed, as he hovered around 50% shooting marks and didn\u2019t turn over the ball at all against Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt junior endured a hot streak recently, improving to a team-best 14.4 points per game, and hasn\u2019t missed a game all season. The Fayetteville, North Carolina, native has led Penn State in scoring with his slick handles and midrange buckets for four of its last five games.</p>\n                <p>Coincidentally, Rutgers is also led by its own upperclassman guard in the form of junior Tariq Francis. Standing four inches shorter than Dilione, at 6-foot-1, Francis hasn\u2019t let his smaller stature stop his scoring.</p>\n                <p>The Pittsburgh native averages over 16 points per game, while only turning the ball over 1.2 times per game on average. The head-to-head matchup between the two primary scorers will be essential because, outside of that, there isn\u2019t much creation of buckets.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have a pair of double-digit scorers joining Dilione, with Josh Reed and Kayden Mingo, who can assist Dilione on the offensive end. Outside of Francis, the Scarlet Knights only have sophomore Dylan Grant, who averages double-digit scoring.</p>\n                <p>The forward provides solid rebounding but can have streaky offensive moments that limit his efficiency.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019ll be back to the fundamentals for Penn State and Rutgers, as the paint battle matters just as much as the duel between the guards. Nittany Lions\u2019 freshman 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107, who at times has struggled against physical big men, will see that exact flaw tested once again.</p>\n                <p>Senior Emmanuel Ogbole leads the Scarlet Knights off the glass and averages over a board more per game than Juric. Despite the 6-foot-10 Ogbole losing the height battle, he has the weight advantage to dominate Juri\u0107 down low and even became a minor internet sensation earlier this year for his impressive physique.</p>\n                <p>As for injuries, both squads are only slightly affected. Rutgers listed a pair of questionables on its availability report before its last game, while Nittany Lions forward Tibor Mirti\u0107 marks the only absence for the blue and white, still day-to-day from a shoulder injury</p>\n                <p>The game is set for streaming on the Big Ten Network, with a 6 p.m. tipoff for Penn State\u2019s \u201cAcademic Achievement Night and Faculty and Staff Appreciation Night.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Penn State hasn\u2019t found much success in the Big Ten this season, but nevertheless, it\u2019ll have a postseason to look forward to inside the United Center, beginning on March 10.</p>\n                <p>With five games left in the Nittany Lions\u2019 regular season, here\u2019s a look at their seeding projection for the Big Ten Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Current seeding</p>\n                <p>At 2-13 in Big Ten play, Penn State sits tied for 17th in the conference standings with Northwestern. For seeding tiebreakers, the Wildcats would have the advantage as they won the regular-season matchup between the two teams, which gives the Nittany Lions the No. 18 seed in the tournament.</p>\n                <p>If the tournament started right now, Penn State would face No. 15 seed Maryland in the first round on March 10, and the Terrapins defeated the Nittany Lions 96-73 during the regular season.</p>\n                <p>Were Penn State to beat Maryland in that hypothetical matchup, it\u2019d face No. 10 seed Indiana in the second round on March 11. The winner of that game would play No. 7 seed UCLA in the third round on March 12, and No. 2 seed Illinois would await in the quarterfinals on March 13.</p>\n                <p>Upcoming week</p>\n                <p>Penn State has another pair of Big Ten games this week, starting with a home matchup with Rutgers on Wednesday before an away contest against No. 9 Nebraska on Saturday. Depending on those results and other games across the conference, the Nittany Lions\u2019 seeding could change at the conclusion of this week.</p>\n                <p>If Penn State goes 2-0, the team could jump up four spots to the No. 14 seed following this week\u2019s slate of games. It would depend on Rutgers, Northwestern, Maryland and Oregon all remaining under four Big Ten wins after their games this week.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights and the Terrapins are tied for 15th in the standings at 3-11 each. The Ducks are 16th at 2-12 in the Big Ten, while the Wildcats are 2-13.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has the opportunity to get the head-to-head tiebreaker over Rutgers following this week, but the two teams will meet again at the end of the regular season. Otherwise, the Nittany Lions lost the head-to-head tiebreaker to Northwestern, Maryland and Oregon, so minimizing the number of wins they get will be best for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>A 1-1 week wouldn\u2019t create much improvement for Penn State seeding-wise. Whether the win comes from the Rutgers or Nebraska game, the Nittany Lions would most likely end the week with the No. 17 seed.</p>\n                <p>If the Nittany Lions posted a 0-2 week, they would remain in the No. 18 seed. Due to its lack of holding many head-to-head tiebreakers, Penn State is going to need to stack some wins in order to move up in seeding.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State returned from its six-day West Coast trip late Saturday night after going 1-1 across its games against Washington and Oregon.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades returned to the Bryce Jordan Center for his weekly press conference Monday afternoon and provided insight into the results as the Nittany Lions sit at 11-15 overall and 2-13 in Big Ten play this season.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what Rhoades said during his presser.</p>\n                <p>Looking at Washington win</p>\n                <p>Penn State won its second conference game of the year when it defeated Washington last Wednesday, 63-60. Rhoades has a pair of takeaways from the matchup he wants to carry into future games.</p>\n                <p>Firstly, Rhoades thought the defense was \u201cvery good\u201d versus the Huskies. Washington shot 37.7% from the field and 33.3% from 3-point range, and 60 points is the least amount of points scored against the Nittany Lions in Big Ten play this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought it was our best 40-minute game of the year defensively,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI thought guys guarded the ball really well. We guarded the ball as a team. I just thought we sustained our defense throughout the game more than we have all year long.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Throughout a close contest down the stretch, the Huskies were held without a field goal for the final 2:44 of the game.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades also mentioned interior offense as another takeaways as Penn State scored 32 points in the paint and went 7-of-9 on layups.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought on the offensive end, even though the way they tried to guard us, I just thought we were really assaulting the paint, attacking and getting to the rim a lot,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIt's just a good formula for these guys.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades added that he felt the practice the Nittany Lions had a day before the Washington game, and the team carried the momentum into the matchup.</p>\n                <p>Dealing with adversity</p>\n                <p>During the Oregon game, Penn State tied the score 46-46 but eventually lost, 83-72. Rhoades attributed the runs the Ducks rattled off to secure the win to his players not responding well enough.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought we allowed a possession here or there to make them bother us too much, like you got to move on to the next play,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI just thought we were sensitive at times, and I've used that with our guys. If a play doesn't go your way, it's how you respond, not how you react. Reacting doesn't have you ready for the next play.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said he told his players it\u2019s \u201creally hard\u201d to win if they hold onto plays that happened in the past. He reiterated that it\u2019s important to be ready for the next play.</p>\n                <p>In the Washington win, Rhoades felt his players were \u201creally good\u201d in dealing with adversity and moving on to the next play. However, the Nittany Lions didn\u2019t respond enough to come back against Oregon.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has the youngest team in the Big Ten and one of the youngest teams in the country, according to Rhoades. He thinks players get better at dealing with adversity when they get older.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you want it to get better, it will get better,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSome fight it. Some get better at it. Some see the difference when they start handling it the right way and dealing with it the right way. They see their game take off, their mentality take off, their competitive approach take off. The team gets better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>3-point defense vs. Oregon</p>\n                <p>Part of the reason why Penn State lost to Oregon was its 3-point defense. The Ducks, who shoot 32.9% from 3-point range this season, drained 14-of-27 shots from deep, including 7-of-10 in the second half.</p>\n                <p>It continued a trend for the Nittany Lions, who are allowing Big Ten opponents to shoot 41.6% from 3-point range this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGetting in rotation very early in the clock gets you behind, and then when that ball gets hot, when that ball gets moving, you're late,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cLook, there's good players, so the more open they are, the easier it is to shoot it. I think that part of it has been the hardest thing for our defense.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With the lack of a true shot blocker, Penn State tends to double an opposing player when they drive into the paint. While that could shut down the chance for a shot in the interior, a shooter typically becomes open beyond the arc.</p>\n                <p>There are examples like the Washington matchup where the 3-point defense held the other team to less efficient shooting.

    "title": "Review | What Olivia Dean\u2019s \u2018The Art of Loving\u2019 can teach us about adoration",
    "author": "Rebecca Fein | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>\u201cBest New Artist\u201d Grammy winner, Olivia Dean, knocked it out of the park with her second studio album \u201cThe Art of Loving.\u201d The British singer-songwriter wrote a masterpiece that veraciously depicts the meaning of love.</p>\n                <p>The album starts with a 40 second soft-spoken song entitled \u201cThe Art of Loving (Intro).\u201d Although very short, the few lyrics packed a punch.</p>\n                <p>Dean sings, \u201cIt\u2019s the art of loving, it wasn\u2019t all for nothing, yeah you taught me something.\u201d These lyrics being repeated over a mushy melody set the album up for listeners to go in with an open-mind about love, rather than their preconceived notions of good or bad.</p>\n                <p>The album continues with the slightly more upbeat \u201cNice To Each Other.\u201d As we join Dean on this journey of exploring love, she gives us the ultimate situationship song. \u201cNice To Each Other\u201d highlights the balance of living in the moment versus thinking ahead to the future.</p>\n                <p>Sometimes when you enter a relationship, you know it won\u2019t work out, but Dean says if we let loose, have fun and are nice to each other, we can experience unexpected enjoyment even if it\u2019s short-term.</p>\n                <p>Following \u201cNice To Each Other\u201d is \u201cLady Lady.\u201d A relationship is nothing without personal growth and this bluesy R&amp;B number reminds people to not get used to the person you are because we are all in a stage of becoming. Whether that\u2019s becoming something new, nicer or different, it is something fresh and it is okay to embrace it.</p>\n                <p>Next on the album is \u201cClose Up.\u201d In this song, we switch back to the softer vibes presented earlier in the album, but this time with a minor scale twist, making the song a little eerie at first. It then picks up in the chorus with short steady trumpet blairs in the background, to keep the pacing quick.</p>\n                <p>This song harps on the idea of beating yourself up for falling for the wrong person. With lyrics like, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if you need me or want me all that much. Did I misread completely, every single touch,\u201d we get vibes of desperation and anguish.</p>\n                <p>This energy is quickly washed away when the next song, \u201cSo Easy (To Fall In Love)\u201d comes on. This cheery, jazzy, almost dream-like song reminds us that when love is right, it will feel simple and easy.</p>\n                <p>With \u201cLet Alone The One You Love,\u201d the dejected tone is back. This song is very important, especially to people pleasers who put others before themselves every time.</p>\n                <p>This song tries to show that if somebody truly loved you they wouldn\u2019t try to diminish you or make you feel less then. But most importantly, they wouldn\u2019t try to hold you back because as Dean says, \u201cwho would do that to a friend, let alone the one you love.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cMan I Need,\u201d Dean\u2019s next song and arguably her most popular, is a fan favorite on the album. \u201cMan I Need\u201d is about exactly its name. In the new year, we\u2019re raising our standards and waiting for someone who is kind, patient and takes care of us. This song blew up on TikTok in late 2025 and was used as the soundtrack for women to claim to the world they are done putting up with lousy guys.</p>\n                <p>The following track \u201cSomething Inbetween\u201d has a quick tempo that is kept by a drum being played in a repeated pattern. This song details the point in a relationship where one could feel an imbalance between dependence and individualism. It\u2019s a gray area. How do we reach equilibrium so yourself as a person and yourself in a couple is equal?</p>\n                <p>\u201cLoud,\u201d contrary to its name, is about the deafening silence that comes when a partner feels unheard. The daunting melodies in the background, with Dean singing in an untraditional diatonic scale, leads to this gut-wrenching masterpiece.</p>\n                <p>Dean says \u201cAnd everything\u2019s unspoken now, I'm out, the silence is so loud,\u201d alluding to the idea that sometimes in relationships, people feel silenced or stifled, but this is no way to have a healthy, stable connection with someone.</p>\n                <p>As we transition to the end of the album we reach \u201cBaby Steps.\u201d This is a tender and passionate song about navigating heartbreak and welcoming independence. Its upbeat, yet cautious tone heads as a warning that although the process may be slow, you will make it through.</p>\n                <p>Next is \u201cA Couple Minutes,\u201d a ragtime inspired tune with a swing refrain, this song explores the ideation of running into a past lover. In those few minutes you see this person, your world stops. Maybe you sit and chat for a little, maybe it is just a glance, but either way, you have to remember that real life is waiting for you to return.</p>\n                <p>Lastly is \u201cI\u2019ve Seen It,\u201d which to put simply, is a beautiful song. An album that depicts the grapples, but also the jubilation that comes with love needed a cohesive, yet reflective ending, and this song did that perfectly.</p>\n                <p>From \u201cThe Art of Loving (Intro)\u201d all the way to \u201cI\u2019ve Seen It,\u201d Olivia Dean tells a compelling story. There will be sorrow, there will be bliss, but where there is love there is existence, waiting to be reveled in.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "author": "Sami Altmire | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Team USA faced off against Team Sweden on Monday, both 4-0 so far in the Olympic tournament, and both were the zeitgeists of the tournament. Team USA showed exactly how much talent they have, shut out Team Sweden and advanced to the gold medal match 5-0.</p>\n                <p>The first period opened up with Sweden, which showed immediate control over the puck and looked to get Team USA on its toes early on. The beginning of the period saw a lot of back-and-forth possession, and the United States really looked to get the puck out and around Sweden, often shifting control over to Caroline Harvey.</p>\n                <p>Team USA kept that control and allowed Cayla Barnes to put the puck through Sweden and score with 14:51 left in the first period.</p>\n                <p>Team USA received its first power play of the game with 8:21 left in the period, with Sweden's Sara Hjalmarsson getting sent to the box for boarding. That allowed for a boost of confidence for the already strong Team USA to get the puck right up where it wanted it. Team Sweden got back to full strength and immediately got its first shot on goal.</p>\n                <p>The first period ended 1-0 for Team USA and already showed what kind of game this would be. Team USA came in hot with 13 shots on goal, and Team Sweden continued to sneak around the Americans and use the perimeter around the net, hoping to find a crack in the USA defense.</p>\n                <p>The second period began, and the Swedes showed obvious fervor, immediately notching two shots on goal and making contact with multiple Team USA players. American goalkeeper Aerin Frankel continued to ward off Team Sweden's attempts at a goal, but obvious cracks began to show in Team USA\u2019s defense.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden got its first power play of the game after USA\u2019s Hayley Scamurra received two minutes for tripping.</p>\n                <p>Team USA grabbed its second goal with 10:51 left in the period after Taylor Heise lobbed it into the net with quality teamwork from Hannah Bilka and Abbey Murphy.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden hoped to get back at Team USA by tapping into its second power play of the game and continued to utilize the rest of its roster. Swedish defensemen and former Nittany Lion Jessica Adolfsson was really driving the play down the ice, maneuvering through Team USA.</p>\n                <p>Murphy snuck around the corner of the Sweden goal and put No. 3 into the net with 15:12 left in the period. Kendall Coyne-Schofield utilized the frenzied Team Sweden and grabbed the fourth goal and Hayley Scamurra put away the fifth, all within two minutes of each other, to take a 5-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Tensions continued to rise, and it ended up being 4-on-4 to end the second period, with Murphy and Adolfsson ending up in the box.</p>\n                <p>With both teams back at full strength, the last period started off with the USA immediately fighting to widen its goal margin, and Sweden trying to create a chance at a goal or two. Nittany Lion Tessa Janecke continued to work around the Swedes and kept herself around the perimeter of Team Sweden\u2019s territory.</p>\n                <p>Sweden gets a power play with 1:26 left in the third period, but it wasn\u2019t enough to grab a last minute goal, and Team USA will head to the gold medal match after beating the Swedes 5-0.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Team USA will face the winner of the Team Canada-Team Switzerland matchup, hitting the ice again for the gold medal game at 1:10 p.m., Thursday, Feb. 19 in Milano, Italy.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Weekly Recap | Rejuvenated Nittany Lions put up mixed results across the nation",
    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State has had an interesting last two weeks, showcasing some life from a team that was struggling to find a win at the beginning of the Big Ten schedule.</p>\n                <p>Since the last rundown, the blue and white dropped three of four, with two tight games that went both ways for Penn State and a pair of not-so-close outings highlighted by a 41-point battering by No. 2 Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>\n                <p>Can\u2019t celebrate the clip</p>\n                <p>Let\u2019s start with that outing in the Great Lakes State, where Penn State\u2019s three-point shot couldn\u2019t buy a bucket, as the Nittany Lions finished with a measly two makes on 20 attempts. The Nittany Lions\u2019 primary big man, 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107, had the flu and missed the game, and that long-range approach wasn\u2019t the needed medicine for Penn State\u2019s absence.</p>\n                <p>That game highlights the sentiment of the blue and white\u2019s play over those four outings; it couldn\u2019t establish a presence from beyond the arc, making just over a quarter of its shots.</p>\n                <p>This struggle is apparent for Rhoades and Co. The only game in the stretch in which it posted a more efficient three-point performance than its opponent was against Washington, but the Nittany Lions shot a tied season-low 13 long-range attempts in that game, and the Huskies had more makes.</p>\n                <p>Maybe \u201cless is more\u201d for the Nittany Lions, but it\u2019s clear they need to find a long-term remedy for their streaky three-point shooting. Penn State allowed a team like Oregon, which posts similar marks on the season, to get hot and outshoot it by 20% from three in a double-digit rout.</p>\n                <p>Nittany Lions, assemble</p>\n                <p>It wasn\u2019t all bad for the Nittany Lions on the hardwood, as they also saw their unit\u2019s ranks refilled by injury returnees.</p>\n                <p>Sharpshooter wing Eli Rice returned after a two-game absence due to a midgame head collision suffered against Minnesota, and his services provided crucial support in Penn State\u2019s triumph over the Huskies. The Gallatin, Tennessee, native played 27 minutes and posted an efficient 12-point outing, making the majority of his shot attempts and committing no turnovers.</p>\n                <p>It didn\u2019t go as well for Rice against the Ducks, with only one make in six shot attempts, but for a Penn State group struggling from long range, it\u2019ll be appreciated to have Rice back, the blue and white\u2019s leader in three-point percentage by over seven percent.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt sophomore wasn\u2019t the only player who came back; forward Sas\u01ce Ciani returned after a stint on the bench due to an ankle injury, bringing a needed physical piece back. The Nova Gorica, Slovenia, native appeared in 20 minutes across Penn State\u2019s West Coast trip, and logged four fouls, a steal and a rebound in his time on the court, with no shot attempts.</p>\n                <p>It leaves only one absence for Penn State, forward Tibor Mirti\u010d, but he\u2019s been reported as day-to-day and has been seen without the sling previously used to help nurse his shoulder injury, so a return could be imminent.</p>\n                <p>Last-minute deciders</p>\n                <p>Well, there are two marquee moments left to talk about: USC\u2019s silver screen-esque buzzer-beater to defeat the blue and white, courtesy of hyped Alijah Arenas, and a late-game back-and-forth exchange against the Huskies that ended in Penn State victory.</p>\n                <p>Happy Valley had to play the victim to possibly Arenas\u2019 first moment as a star in the game of basketball, and it was a stellar move with almost nothing Penn State could have done to stop it. Rhoades did claim postgame that a Penn State player, whom he didn\u2019t name, failed to switch correctly on the possession.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions almost suffered the same fate against Washington, accidentally leaving a man open with six milliseconds left on the clock to huck up an open three that would have sent the game to overtime \u2013 except it didn\u2019t fall.</p>\n                <p>It would\u2019ve soured the Nittany Lions' day, as they fought to control a game late, which was tied with a little over a minute on the clock.</p>\n                <p>Although these two games stick out over the stretch of recent play by Penn State, there is one that needs to be praised more than any, and that's of the blue and white\u2019s only real returning rotational player from last season, Freddie Dilione V.</p>\n                <p>Dilione has had some of the craftiest buckets the Bryce Jordan Center has ever seen, fitting of the Kobe\u2019s he can be seen rocking. The influence on Dilione\u2019s game is clear, as the Penn State guard has begun to make a home in the midrange.</p>\n                <p>Over the last four games, the Fayetteville, North Carolina, Native has led the Nittany Lions in scoring in all but one game.</p>\n                <p>The junior has been a real iron man of sorts for Penn State, only trailing freshman Kayden Mingo in minutes per game for Penn State, while being one of four players to play all 26 games. That continued over this last stretch, where Dilione played all 40 minutes against the Wolverines.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Emma Strickling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When you think of Bob Dylan, what comes to mind? Is it his \u201cinability\u201d to sing? Is it his songwriting prowess? Or is it the fact that Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet portrayed him in a movie last year?</p>\n                <p>Love him, hate him, or are completely unfamiliar with him, there\u2019s no question that Bob Dylan is one of the most significant figures in music and culture. Throughout his lengthy career, he\u2019s created roughly 40 studio albums and has received several accolades, including 10 Grammys, an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and, most notably, the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016.</p>\n                <p>But if you dig through all the work he\u2019s done, there\u2019s one project that doesn\u2019t get enough recognition: his radio show.</p>\n                <p>Debuting in May of 2006, \u201cTheme Time Radio Hour\u201d was a show hosted by Bob Dylan. It aired on the SiriusXM channel Deep Tracks and ran until April 2009. Although the show no longer runs on the platform, recordings can be found via YouTube.</p>\n                <p>With every episode, the mood is set by its signature \u201cnighttime in the big city\u201d introduction read by actress Ellen Barkin. It\u2019s poetic and oftentimes moody, describing the atmosphere of life in a big city and the people in it. It can be spoken with chatter, jazz music and the sound of rain in the background.</p>\n                <p>After the ambience has been set, enter the host, Bob Dylan. Each episode, he introduces a theme around which each music selection is centered. Some of the themes that have been used include, but are not limited to, wedding, the moon and days of the week.</p>\n                <p>The song selection isn\u2019t one that\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s an eclectic mix of tunes, mostly featuring songs from the mid-twentieth century, possibly the music that inspired a young Dylan while he was in Minnesota. In between each song, Dylan provides facts about the artists as well as poetry related to the theme and even his own legendary commentary.</p>\n                <p>While this might seem obscure and irrelevant now, its value is something that continues to last.</p>\n                <p>The show highlights the work of artists who have contributed to the music scene and might not be as well-known today as they were at the time of their artistry. Much like a memory, their work and their own image can fade away if not kept alive. The show acts as a reminder of the music that has helped to shape music into the way it\u2019s now.</p>\n                <p>It provides the listener with the experience of the evolution of music and the people who helped lay the foundation for certain genres. For example, one artist who has been featured on \u201cTheme Time Radio Hour\u201d is Sister Rosetta Tharpe, who is considered to be the godmother of Rock n\u2019 Roll and is ranked number six on Rolling Stone\u2019s \u201c250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Now I\u2019m not saying this show saved her from disappearing from history; her talent and music can stand on their own. But it\u2019s through a show like Dylan\u2019s that her music reaches a broader audience and further broadens their musical horizons.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s an engaging space, one that you can often leave with more information than you came with, either about the theme of the episode or about a musical artist. It\u2019s a new take and isn\u2019t some redundant and dull commercial type of radio.</p>\n                <p>In terms of Dylan himself, the show is an opportunity for him to showcase another side of himself. He has been known to adopt many personas throughout his career. It\u2019s hard to say where the distinction between fabrication and reality lies. While the DJ version can seem like yet another mask in a closet full of them, Dylan\u2019s wit and interest in music seem to be qualities that are genuine, providing a more personal look into the enigmatic artist.</p>\n                <p>Much like Bob Dylan, \u201cTheme Time Radio Hour\u201d is another singular entity. While it might only exist through YouTube now, the value of the show still lives on. Wannabe radio show hosts can try and select music to a theme while inserting their own commentary, but only Dylan\u2019s essence can deliver a show of such caliber.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Lily Dorf | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>As the season of love comes to a close, many college students are mourning the crushes and long-lost loves that never came to be. Dating in college is no easy challenge. However, for two students, the near impossible became a reality.</p>\n                <p>Keerthana Rajamohan and Ansh Ahuja have been together for three and a half years, and started dating during Rajamohan\u2019s first year when a mutual friend introduced them.</p>\n                <p>The two met in-person during a night out, and the rest is history. Rajamohan, a fourth-year student studying supply chain management, said she easily recalls how they fell in love.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe just got along right off the bat,\u201d Rajamohan said. \u201cHe is very respectful and such a great gentleman. Honestly, I've never met anyone like him before, so I was hooked.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For Ahuja, the moment he fell for Rajamohan was straight out of a romantic comedy.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI remembered that I was just walking around the Palmerton \u2014 literally in circles \u2014 on the phone with my mom and talking about this girl,\u201d Ahuja said. \u201cI told my mom during my junior or senior year of high school that I don't think I could get into a relationship because I love myself too much, (and) it sounds a little narcissistic, I know. But the fact that I was pacing around, contemplating this, I hung up the phone, and I kind of knew that I really wanted to do this because I wouldn't have even considered this if I was really hesitant about it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ahuja graduated with a degree in labor and human resources in spring 2025 and the two are now long-distance.</p>\n                <p>Rajamohan\u2019s friend, Danielle Bocchieri, has seen the couple through all of their stages and describes their relationship as \u201csupportive.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think that they both do a really good job putting their personal lives first and foremost, and then using the relationship to kind of just support them and help them grow and be the best version of themselves,\u201d Bocchierri, a fourth-year student studying biology said.</p>\n                <p>For many, the idea of having a relationship in college isn\u2019t possible, from schedules not lining up to hours of studying and other priorities taking hold. However, Rajamohan sees it differently.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think that being in college has definitely made us stronger and I think that we are both focusing on ourselves, but also being there for one another,\u201d Rajamohan said. \u201cWe both have our lives. He has his job and I have school.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ahuja said he\u2019s happy he was able to experience a college love story, despite there being stigma around college relationships.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI wanted a deep and meaningful personal relationship with someone who I truly like and I truly love,\u201d Ahuja said. \u201cSo I'm glad that I got to experience, I guess, the unpopular experience in college.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rajamohan and Ahuja said they\u2019re always there for each other. The pair know if a trip to see one another doesn\u2019t work out, they\u2019ll still end the day with each other over the phone.</p>\n                <p>When talking about the challenges of long distance, Ahuja said they support each other as people first, not just another person in the relationship.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI didn't want her to come to college, get into a relationship and be solely focused on the relationship,\u201d Ahuja said. \u201cRather, she came to college for a reason, as did I. So again, we're really supportive of \u2026 each other's hobbies, our goals and our aspirations.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ahuja said he doesn't view their relationship as a chore.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it's about perspective as well,\u201d Ahuja said. \u201cI don't view this relationship as something I have to do. Rather, it\u2019s something I get to do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>On Dec. 20, 2025, Maggie Mendelson took the hardwood court holding a basketball just 14 days after finishing her Penn State volleyball career.</p>\n                <p>Mendelson became the first two-sport athlete for Penn State since 2019 \u2014 when Mac Hippenhammer played both football and baseball for the school \u2014 when she announced her decision to join the Lady Lions on June 25.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I was going through recruiting, my parents told me not to let anyone force me to do something I didn\u2019t want to,\u201d Mendelson told The Daily Collegian. \u201cI think it\u2019d be a really cool opportunity if I could play two sports, and nobody ever told me I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While the North Ogden, Utah, native finished her career playing both volleyball and basketball in Happy Valley, it wasn\u2019t that straight of a path for the two-sport star.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGrowing up, I always played a lot of sports like volleyball, basketball, softball, tennis, track and kind of just did it all,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cMy dad also played basketball and baseball in college, so playing multiple sports was just running in the family.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mendelson was ranked 32nd in the nation in basketball and fourth in volleyball, giving her an opportunity to play either sport collegiately.</p>\n                <p>When she went to Nebraska, her coaches gave her the chance to play both sports, which she did her freshman year.</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-5 forward played in 22 games with the Cornhuskers, averaging 2.0 points and 2.2 rebounds per game. On the volleyball court, she appeared in 14 matches and recorded 47 kills.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I went to Nebraska, I decided to play volleyball and basketball just because they had a great plan,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cIt just felt really welcoming and open.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After her first year in both sports, Mendelson put her basketball career on the side, focusing on her more dominant sport in volleyball.</p>\n                <p>Mendelson saw a slight decrease in playing time her sophomore year, playing just 26 sets. Following Year 2, she entered the transfer portal and landed at Penn State in 2024.</p>\n                <p>In her first year with the blue and white, Mendelson played a career-high 127 sets in 37 matches, recording 242 kills.As the season progressed, Mendelson\u2019s efforts as a leader became apparent, helping the Nittany Lions to several big wins en route to an NCAA tournament appearance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a phenomenal leader,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said.</p>\n                <p>Following the conclusion of the regular season, the Nittany Lions earned wins in the NCAA first round, second round, regional semifinal and regional final before taking the court against Nebraska in the NCAA semifinals.</p>\n                <p>Shocking the volleyball world, Mendelson and Penn State engineered a reverse sweep against the Cornhuskers, clinching an NCAA championship appearance. After sweeping Louisville earlier in the season, the Nittany Lions won the national championship 3-1 amidst coach Katie Schumacher-Cawley\u2019s cancer journey.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat volleyball did to win that national championship, I think it still gives everybody chills,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cFighting through adversity and being a phenomenal leader and having their team play with so much joy and so much passion on that floor for that jersey.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions ended their season victorious, and in the months to come, Mendelson announced her decision to rekindle her passion for basketball and compete in both sports for the 2025-26 season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m so excited for Maggie,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cShe\u2019s high level, not only on the volleyball court, but the basketball court as well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mendelson took the volleyball court for her senior season, and despite not earning another national championship, made her mark on the program\u2019s history.</p>\n                <p>After seeing her success on the volleyball court, the Lady Lions were excited for her to join them on the basketball court later that season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think she\u2019s got a live, active body, in terms of energy,\u201d general manager Jason Crafton said. \u201cShe runs the floor very well, she\u2019s long. She\u2019s just a high-energy player that\u2019s a competitor.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 volleyball season ended on Dec. 6 with a shutout loss to Texas in the NCAA first round, and within a few days, Mendelson was already in the Bryce Jordan Center practice gym, looking to earn playing time on the court.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(The transition) has been pretty difficult, I\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a completely different sport. The physicality is something that I\u2019ve definitely lost touch with for the past couple years, just because there\u2019s the net between you in volleyball, so now I\u2019m definitely getting bruised up.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite the tough transition back into the game, Mendelson earned her first minutes on Dec. 20 against VCU and appeared in the starting lineup for the first time the following day.</p>\n                <p>While she recorded only eight points in nearly 30 minutes, her playing time was highlighted by her on-court leadership that helped motivate the Lady Lions in a difficult loss.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think I really try to bring my winning mindset to practice every day and just make sure that I\u2019m putting myself into the most competitive mindset so it feeds off onto everybody else,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cI think that if you\u2019re around winners all the time, a winning mindset starts to become natural.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Over the past month-and-a-half of action, Mendelson\u2019s time on the court has decreased slightly, and she\u2019s only scored seven total points through the last nine games.Regardless, Mendelson said she\u2019s grateful for the opportunity to play two sports.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a really cool opportunity for me to be a role model for a lot of young kids who are always told to just choose one,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cI just want to be a role model to those kids, that you don't have to choose one, you don't have to limit yourself, because there's a lot of opportunities for you to follow your dreams to the fullest extent. I always just want to be a role model and live out my dreams and really become the best person and athlete that I can be.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With her first year with the Lady Lions coming to a close over the next few weeks, Mendelson will have the opportunity to suit up for Penn State one last time next year and bring success to her squad.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been to where we\u2019re trying to get,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI have zero doubts that she\u2019s going to come in here and help the program from Day 1.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE SPORTS COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Penn State wrestling Black history through Collegian reporting",
    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State introduced its wrestling program in 1908 and has since become one of the most storied programs in the sport\u2019s history. However, much like the program\u2019s success, its history of trailblazing Black athletes is a more recent trend.</p>\n                <p>For the first 80-plus years of the program, there were no records of a Black national champion. This is due to the sport as a whole taking a long time to become more inclusive throughout the 20th century. As the demographics of the sport changed, the Nittany Lions were the home of history for Black athletes both in college and beyond.</p>\n                <p>In 1992, Penn State welcomed the man who would be their first Black national champion in Kerry McCoy. The heavyweight entered the program as a coveted prospect, having only lost one match in his final two years of high school and competing internationally before arriving at Rec Hall.</p>\n                <p>McCoy\u2019s sophomore year in 1994 saw him rise to the top of the nation, becoming Penn State\u2019s first Black national champion, and its first wrestler to win a title in his sophomore season. By the end of his collegiate career, McCoy won two national championships, three Big Ten titles, and went on an 88-match winning streak. He later qualified for two Olympic rosters, including a fifth-place finish in 2000.</p>\n                <p>But McCoy is also known for his status as an advocate for inclusion in the sport of wrestling. He began this ambition while he was in high school, and has continued to speak on diversity in wrestling throughout his career.</p>\n                <p>As the millennium crossed into the year 2000, the landscape of wrestling began to shift into the modern diverse demographic seen today. Penn State employed trailblazers in the decade, including one of the most unique stories in college sports history in paraplegic wrestler Rohan Murphy who lost both of his legs at birth.</p>\n                <p>Murphy dreamt of becoming an athlete in his youth and in ninth grade, he tried out for wrestling. After receiving training from former NCAA, UFC and WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, Murphy saw success in his senior year before attending Penn State.</p>\n                <p>When Murphy asked to join the Penn State wrestling team, coach Troy Sunderland met him with skepticism. He invited him down to Mount Nittany where he directed his team to run to the top as their first day of training. Murphy crawled up the mountain, reaching his teammates in 90 minutes.</p>\n                <p>The New York City native managed a 5-15 record against able-bodied opponents in the Big Ten, and since graduating, became a power lifter and motivational speaker seeking to inspire youth going through similar struggles for himself.</p>\n                <p>In 2008, Penn State celebrated its second Black champion, Phil Davis. Known as \u201cMr. Wonderful,\u201d Davis was the first Black Nittany Lion to become a four-time All-American between 2004-08. It took him until his senior year to secure his elusive national title.</p>\n                <p>Immediately after winning his national title, Davis transitioned to mixed martial arts, where he made even more of a name for himself. The Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, native won the Bellator light heavyweight championship in 2016 and continued competing in the sport until 2025. Davis set the precedent for future Nittany Lions like Bo Nickal, Carter Starocci and Greg Kerkvliet to take their skills into MMA.</p>\n                <p>The 2010s marked over 100 years of the Penn State wrestling program, where it saw the start of the dynasty it has become. Since Cael Sanderson took over in 2011, the Nittany Lions have revolutionized wrestling with a diverse group spearheading the legacy.</p>\n                <p>Two years into Sanderson\u2019s tenure, the first pair of Black teammates to win national championships together in blue and white occurred. Ed Ruth and Quentin Wright won individual titles in 2013. It was the second national title for each of them, with Ruth going on to win a third in 2014. After his 136-3 college career ended, Ruth joined McCoy in his advocacy for the sport of wrestling.</p>\n                <p>Ruth also set off a run of success at the 174-pound weight class for Black athletes at Penn State, as after he graduated, Mark Hall made an impact at the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Hall was the first Black freshman to take home a national championship trophy to Happy Valley. Hall graduated in 2020, giving up the 174 pound spot to Starocci, which led a trio of history makers for Penn State in the first half of the decade.</p>\n                <p>Starocci, Kerkvliet and Aaron Brooks accomplished historical feats that seemed mathematically impossible as recently as 2019. Due to the COVID-19, Starocci and Kerkvleit were able to become five-time All-Americans.</p>\n                <p>Brooks and Starocci combined to become the first teammates to win four-individual national titles in the same lineup. Brooks went on to win a bronze medal in the 2024 Olympics, while Starocci remained with Penn State to become the only wrestler in history to win a fifth National Championship.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Collegian Business Division",
    "description": "<p>The blankets of snow will be melting before we know it, welcoming golfers to hit the greens. Here in State College, that means going to <a href=\"https://mtviewcountryclub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mountain View Country Club in Boalsburg</a>.</p>\n                <p>Although Mountain View once may have only been known for traditional, outdoor golf, the club is leveling up with two brand new golf simulators and two professional-grade racing simulators.</p>\n                <p>If your golf skills aren\u2019t up to par and you want to get some practice in before the season starts, or you just prefer the idea of staying indoors, Hacktivist Happy Valley is the place for you.</p>\n                <p>Just a flight of stairs down from <a href=\"https://mtviewcountryclub.com/theview/\" target=\"_blank\">The View</a> restaurant, sits the Hacktivist Happy Valley lounge where the simulators are housed. Complete with couches, multiple TVs and high-top tables, this space is perfect for a casual gathering with friends and family or for a more upscale social for a club or organization.</p>\n                <p>Hacktivist Happy Valley Lounge</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not just your ordinary golf practice space either. Its warm, welcoming ambience creates a sense of comfort that will make you want to come back again and again. Open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., Hacktivist Happy Valley is a space for all Penn State students, faculty and staff to unwind and de-stress.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHacktivist Happy Valley is social, welcoming and reflects where hospitality is heading, which is towards experiences that bring people together in meaningful ways\u201d Charles Creek, the Food and Beverage Director for Wyndham Garden and Mountain View Country Club, said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to offer something that feels fresh for Happy Valley, while honoring the tradition of Mountain View County Club.\u201d</p>\n                <p>If you\u2019ve never used golf or racing simulators before, there\u2019s no need to worry; they don\u2019t require any experience. Hacktivist Happy Valley gives everyone, no matter the skill level, the opportunity to take a break from the stress of school and work and just have an enjoyable time.</p>\n                <p>With additional interactive games such as mini-golf programmed into the golf simulators, and many extra features on the racing simulator, there\u2019s a ton of different options to choose from so that everyone can get involved, no matter their interests.</p>\n                <p>The View</p>\n                <p>You can also order food and beverages from The View restaurant through a kiosk in the lounge, making the area the ideal place to hang out, grab a bite to eat and have a great time. The View offers delicious options including shareable appetizers and elevated comfort food. One of Creek\u2019s personal favorite dishes is the Loaded View Chips (piled high with toppings).</p>\n                <p>For students who may be on a budget, there are plenty of food deals that won\u2019t break the bank. There\u2019s also themed days such as Burger Night Wednesday and Wing Thursday.</p>\n                <p>Creek mentioned that Hacktivist Happy Valley is a social lounge first and a golf practice area second. It\u2019s a place for people to get together and just have fun.</p>\n                <p>\u201cUltimately, Hacktivist Happy Valley and The View are about connection,\u201d Creek said. \u201cWe wanted to create a space where people can step away from routines, share a great meal, enjoy a little friendly competition and leave feeling like they experienced something memorable.\u201d</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Twenty years ago, a $5,000 check marked the beginning of the Pink Zone, an annual partnership between the Pennsylvania Pink Zone and Penn State.</p>\n                <p>On Sunday, the 20th anniversary of the Pink Zone game was held during the Lady Lions\u2019 matchup against Northwestern.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is a wonderful event,\u201d Tammy Miller, the Pennsylvania Pink Zone president, said. \u201cThe main goal of today is to recognize survivors.\"</p>\n                <p>Including a pre-game ceremony with survivors walking the \u201cpink carpet\u201d and a halftime dedicated to recognizing survivors, Sunday\u2019s game featured moments to honor those who've experienced breast cancer.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions\u2019 game was also full of big moments, as they defeated Northwestern 81-71 for their second conference win of the year to stay alive in postseason play.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we were able to get a win in front of them tonight because it means so much more than playing a game of basketball, and the fight of their life is so inspiring to us,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to give them a little joy today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After starting hot with a 22-13 first quarter, Penn State\u2019s success continued into the second half, extending the lead by five points.</p>\n                <p>During halftime, the breast cancer survivors took over the court with signs displaying how long they\u2019ve been cancer-free. For some, it was just a few months, but for others, it was 65 years of survivorship.</p>\n                <p>The hundreds of survivors in attendance totaled 1,932 years, seven months and 20 days of breast cancer survivorship.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really fun game to look forward to. We look forward to it every year,\u201d Moriah Murray said. \u201cWe\u2019re really playing for something bigger than ourselves, and we love getting the crowd engaged. Just seeing all the survivors and everyone fighting really gives us the energy going into the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For the Lady Lions, it was more than just the survivors in attendance, but people who were close to them.</p>\n                <p>Per freshman Tea Cleante\u2019s Instagram, her grandmother was diagnosed a few months ago with breast cancer.</p>\n                <p>For Maggie Mendelson, women\u2019s volleyball coach Katie Schumacher-Cawley was the one she was playing for. After being diagnosed with breast cancer on Sept. 24, 2024, Schumacher-Cawley led Mendelson and the Nittany Lions to a national championship, becoming the first female head coach to earn the honor.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSince Maggie is on our team, we get to see coach Katie,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s so special to play again for something bigger than ourselves, especially someone that we know so close in coach Katie, who\u2019s an amazing person.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After the lead was cut to just nine points in the third quarter and even closer throughout the fourth, Penn State closed out the game on a 7-0 run in front of thousands of fans and survivors.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sisterhood here,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSome people in here will be diagnosed next week, some people were diagnosed a year ago, and some are going to be 35-year survivors. It\u2019s the sisterhood that obviously, you\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State welcomed Northwestern for its annual \u2018Pink Zone\u2019 game on Sunday afternoon. The matchup was a battle of two teams at the bottom of the conference standings fighting for a spot in the Big Ten Tournament.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI just want to highlight the 20th anniversary of the pink zone,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said. \u201cAnd it's so awesome to play for survivors and play for something bigger than yourself.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions escaped the Wildcats comeback, winning 81-71.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was extremely proud of our composure in that fourth quarter,\u201d Kieger said.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern won the jump, but after a missed layup from Tayla Thomas, Gracie Merkle grabbed the rebound for Penn State as the ball found its way to T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante for two points to get the scoring started</p>\n                <p>Senior guard Caroline Lau answered with a three-pointer on the other end to get the Wildcats on the board, but then it was all Lady Lions.</p>\n                <p>Penn State exploded for an 8-0 run to take a 10-3 lead just about three minutes into the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>After a 1-for-2 effort on the free throw from Merkle gave the Lady Lions an 11-5 advantage, scoring went silent on both sides for about two minutes until Lau hit her second three-pointer of the day to make it a one-possession game.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern couldn\u2019t threaten anymore, allowing the blue and white to go on another scoring run, this time for seven unanswered points to take an 18-8 lead with three minutes left in the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>Penn State completed its stellar opening frame with a 22-13 edge behind nine points from Kiyomi McMiller. Defense was the story of the Lady Lions\u2019 first quarter effort, recording four steals and scoring 11 points from the seven Wildcats\u2019 turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Moriah Murray got the party started in the second frame with her second three-pointer of the game. Lau attempted to match her on the other end, but instead, McMiller snagged the rebound and found Merkle on the other end for two points.</p>\n                <p>\u201cToday, we put four quarters together, which is something we've been talking about,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cSo we're trying to stack days, trying to stack practices. We're trying to stack film sessions and just keep teaching, keep getting better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The blue and white kept the game in its hands, exploding for a 9-0 run to start the quarter. The Wildcats, on the other hand, started the second quarter 0-for-8 from field-goal range. The drought was broken by an and-one from forward Grace Sullivan.</p>\n                <p>Penn State answered with another deep ball from Murray to take a 34-16 lead with five minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>Sullivan scored the next four points of the game, all from the charity stripe, but Northwestern couldn\u2019t extend its run after McMiller went 2-for-2 in her first trip of the day to the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>After a two-point jumper from Casey Harter for the Wildcats, both teams went scoreless for the last three minutes of the half, giving the Lady Lions a 36-22 lead.</p>\n                <p>McMiller led all scorers with 13 points, as Penn State built off Northwestern\u2019s 18% first half shooting percentage.</p>\n                <p>Penn State picked up right where it left off, scoring six unanswered points to start the third quarter. The Wildcats answered with four straight points from Kat Righeimer.</p>\n                <p>After Nyla McFadden recorded her first points of the game on a fastbreak layup, Righeimer continued her strong quarter with an and-one on the other end.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions responded with five straight points to go up 49-34, but back-to-back threes from Harter and Xamiya Walton helped Northwestern chip into the lead.</p>\n                <p>With just under three minutes to play in the third, McMiller put Penn State up 53-40, but three foul shots from Righeimer put the Wildcats within 10.</p>\n                <p>Following a Lady Lions\u2019 turnover, Sullivan posted a 1-for-2 effort from the line, but McMiller got three points back on the other side.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern outscored Penn State 5-2 in the final 30 seconds to make it a 58-49 game heading into the final frame.</p>\n                <p>Merkle scored the first points of the quarter, but five points from Lau brought the Wildcats within six.</p>\n                <p>A fastbreak layup from McMiller was outdone by a three from Righeimer as Northwestern kept creeping closer. The Wildcats made it a one-possession game for the first time in a long time, with a layup from Lau.</p>\n                <p>However, the Lady Lions held their own, going on a 6-0 run to take a 69-59 lead with five minutes left.</p>\n                <p>A three-pointer by Walton and a pair of free throws from Lau put Northwestern within five once again, but a couple of trips to the foul line helped conserve Penn State\u2019s lead as the blue and white held a 72-66 edge with under two minutes remaining.</p>\n                <p>The Wildcats got two points of their own from the charity stripe to cut the lead to four with a minute left. Merkle immediately matched with a layup on the other end.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern wasn\u2019t done yet, down six with 43 seconds left, Sullivan came up with an and-one to make the score 74-71.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt got away from us a little bit there on a couple of those silly turnovers, but we weathered it,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe got composed and we bounced back, which was really good to see.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In the bonus, McMiller went 2-for-2 from the foul line to regain a two-possession lead as the Wildcats called a timeout to receive the ball on the sideline.</p>\n                <p>Cl\u00e8ante came up big for Penn State on the defensive end, drawing a charge to give the Lady Lions the ball back.</p>\n                <p>McMiller hit two more foul shots with 30 seconds left to give herself a fourth-straight 30-point outing and just about seal the deal for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State travels to New Jersey for its second meeting of the season against Rutgers, with tipoff set for 4 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Felsberg I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State was fresh off a 9-3 win against GCU, ahead of Game 3 in the MLB Desert Invitational against Kansas State. That game saw strong pitching, keeping the Antelopes scoring to a minimum.</p>\n                <p>As Penn State took on Kansas State Sunday afternoon, the Nittany Lions saw quite the role reversal, losing 24-5 in seven innings.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions started the game in the field, with freshman Isaiah Shayter pitching. The first inning saw no offensive action on either side. Kansas State had one hit, but a groundout, along with a strikeout and Robby Bolin got caught stealing at second.</p>\n                <p>Penn State second baseman Jayden Davis knocked a double in his first at-bat, but the Nittany Lions weren\u2019t able to get a run under their belts, with designated hitter Michael Anderson grounding out, along with center fielder Cohl Mercado and third baseman Bryce Molinaro striking out swinging.</p>\n                <p>The second inning is where the bats came alive and each team capitalized. Redshirt sophomore Micah Kendrick got his first hit of the season, a double to right field. This spark of momentum allowed both redshirt senior Kyan Lodice and junior Dee Kennedy to score.</p>\n                <p>After conceding two runs, Penn State\u2019s Joey DeMucci knocked a single to reach base. Following his hit, bases were loaded. Shortstop Preston Yaucher gets an RBI, sending right fielder Jack Porter to get Penn State on the board.</p>\n                <p>Following the second inning, Penn State\u2019s scoring began to gradually decline, whereas the Wildcats kept going strong. Bolin and Grant Gallagher each got on base and scored following Shintaro Inoue\u2019s single base hit.</p>\n                <p>As the game entered the third inning, Penn State regained a short moment of momentum, with a Davis single, Anderson walk and Porter double, allowing Davis to score the blue and white\u2019s second run.</p>\n                <p>Things began to heat up in the bottom of the fourth, and Kansas State coach Peter Hughes was thrown out of the game. Following this confrontation, Penn State scored their third run following Mercado\u2019s single to center field.</p>\n                <p>It seemed as though Penn State would go on a run at any moment to close the gap between the two offenses, but just when the Nittany Lions were able to score, Kansas State shut it down with a double play to end the fourth inning.</p>\n                <p>As the fifth inning crept in, Kennedy continued to lead the Wildcats in an offensive domination, with a home run hit over the left field wall. With this, Penn State continued to dig itself a hole. Scoring didn\u2019t stop there for Kansas State, as sophomore Ty Smolinski\u2019s hit allowed AJ Evasco to earn the Wildcats\u2019 eighth run, Penn State still frozen at four.</p>\n                <p>At the bottom of the sixth, left fielder Jesse Jaconski earned his first home run of 2026, and gave Penn State its fourth run of the matchup.</p>\n                <p>The seventh inning was Kansas State\u2019s sixth straight inning with scoring, and seemingly wiped out Penn State\u2019s chances of a late-game revival. Kennedy continued to dominate, hitting a grand slam to left field. This home run was Kenedy\u2019s third homer of the weekend, and second of the day, along with his 13th RBI.</p>\n                <p>Penn State seemed as though it couldn\u2019t catch a break, regardless of its two outs. A shortstop error allowed Kansas State\u2019s Cadyn Karl and Nick English to score, and the Wildcats lengthened their lead to 20 runs, 13 of them coming from the top of the seventh inning.</p>\n                <p>The bottom of the seventh inning was where the Nittany Lions saw their last look of offensive life with a hit from Davis. While Davis grounded out, Justin Turcovski scored Penn State\u2019s fifth run. The offense was short-lived, as Avery Smith struck out looking and Porter grounded out, concluding the game at 24-5 in the seventh inning by mercy rule.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will play Richmond at 1 p.m. Friday at Pitt Field in Richmond, Virginia, for a nonconference matchup.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Team USA and Team Sweden are playing to see who\u2019ll face the winner of the reigning Olympic champions from Beijing 2022, Team Canada, who faces Team Switzerland in the other semifinal game.</p>\n                <p>American dominance</p>\n                <p>Team USA has been the team to beat all tournament long. Currently, the Americans are on a four-game shutout streak, most recently defeating Team Italy, 6-0, in the quarterfinal game.</p>\n                <p>In the preliminary games, Team USA defeated Team Czechia, 5-1, before stringing together a series of 5-0 victories over Team Finland, Team Switzerland and Team Canada.</p>\n                <p>The Americans, having only allowed a single goal, rank as the top penalty kill in the tournament with a perfect success rate on all eight of their disadvantages.</p>\n                <p>Team USA, backed by Boston Fleet (PWHL) goaltender Aerin Frankel, outscored its opponents 26-1 through five games. Frankel, having played in three of the five games, paces all goaltenders with a .978 save-percentage and .033 goals-against average.</p>\n                <p>Caroline Harvey, a senior defenseman for the Wisconsin Badgers of the WCHA, currently leads the tournament with nine points. Her seven assists lead the statistics.</p>\n                <p>Hannah Bilka and Team Sweden\u2019s Thea Johansson stand at the top of the tournament\u2019s goal-scoring charts with four goals each.</p>\n                <p>Tessa Janecke is the lone Nittany Lion to represent Team USA in Olympic ice hockey this year and has performed aptly in her role as the fourth-line center. While Penn State\u2019s captain hasn\u2019t scored thus far, she\u2019s contributed four assists in five games, with her most recent helper coming in the quarterfinals.</p>\n                <p>Team USA has five players tied for third with four assists each, including Janecke, Abbey Murphy, Laila Edwards, Britta Curl and Megan Keller.</p>\n                <p>Swedish streak</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden\u2019s 2-0 victory over Team Czechia was deemed an upset, as the Czechs placed third in Group A, posting a 1-2-1 record.</p>\n                <p>The leaders of Group B are on a three-game shutout streak and have only allowed two goals in total in the tournament, outscoring its opponents 20-2.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden possesses the second-ranked powerplay in the tournament, with a 31.3% success rate. On the other end of the ice, it has the third-ranked penalty kill with an even 90%.</p>\n                <p>Hanna Olsson leads Team Sweden with seven points in the tournament, scoring three goals and adding four assists, tied for second in the tournament. She is closely followed by Johansson, who\u2019s tallied six points.</p>\n                <p>Goaltender Ebba Traff Svensson ranks second, right behind Frankel, with a .976 save percentage and a 0.50 goals-against-average through four games played.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has one current player and one alumna listed on Team Sweden\u2019s roster. Nicole Hall, a sophomore at Penn State, has yet to register a point. Meanwhile, Jessica Adolfsson, Class of 2021 and member of the Ottawa Charge (PWHL), scored her only goal of the tournament in Team Sweden\u2019s 6-1 victory over Team Italy in the preliminary round</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPIC COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>After a busy January on the recruiting trail for Penn State, the February dead period has arrived.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a recap of all the action the last few weeks.</p>\n                <p>Junior Day</p>\n                <p>Penn State hosted its second Junior Day of the Matt Campbell era during the final weekend in January. Recruits watched the men\u2019s hockey team take on Michigan State in Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>That weekend also brought the Nittany Lions\u2019 first 2028 commitment under Campbell, landing a pledge from 2028 cornerback Deonte Flemings. He was unranked when he committed but is now a 3-star in the 247Sports composite rankings.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019s the No. 132 player nationally, No. 12 cornerback and No. 3 player in Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Three-star 2027 defensive lineman Stanley Montgomery was also in attendance. He was committed to Syracuse at the time of the visit, but backed off his pledge after Junior Day.</p>\n                <p>Montgomery, who plays for Archbishop Ryan High School in Philadelphia, was visited twice at school by the staff. The first time was by defensive line coach Ikaika Malloe and edge rushers coach Christian Smith. The second group of visitors were Campbell and running backs coach Savon Huggins.</p>\n                <p>There were also a trio of former Iowa State priority 2027 targets in attendance in 4-star linebacker Case Alexander, 4-star interior offensive lineman Will Slagle and 3-star linebacker Blake Betton.</p>\n                <p>Alexander is the brother of Iowa State transfer and current Penn State tight end Cooper Alexander and son of former NFL tight end Stephen Alexander. Slagle was a former Cyclone commit. Betton locked in an official visit for the summer.</p>\n                <p>An offensive lineman who visited and has a connection to the current roster was 4-star 2027 offensive tackle Davis Seaman. He plays for Bishop Watterson High School in Ohio, which is where 2026 signee Pete Eglitis attended.</p>\n                <p>Other ranked visitors in the 2027 class included 4-star linebacker Tysir Young, 3-star running back Kelvin Morrison and 3-star athlete DJ Davis. Unranked prospects in the 2027 class who made the trip were defensive lineman Cahron Wheeler and a pair of cornerbacks in Ryan Drakeford and DeNairo Girton Jr.</p>\n                <p>Final lists</p>\n                <p>Recruits are starting to narrow down schools, so with a handful of prospects releasing their final group of schools, Penn State made the cut for some but also missed out on others in the 2027 class.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions made the top-4 schools for 3-star safety Zayvon Miller, top five for 4-star interior offensive lineman Kyler Kuhn, top eight for 4-star defensive lineman George Toia and top 10 for 5-star defensive lineman Marcus Fakatou.</p>\n                <p>Penn State didn\u2019t make the final four schools for 5-star interior offensive lineman Maxwell Hiller and 4-star linebacker Noah Glover.</p>\n                <p>Hiller\u2019s current finalists are Ohio State, Alabama, Florida and Tennessee. Assuming he takes an official visit to all of his top schools, the in-state talent will have one weekend open for Penn State to potentially re-enter the race.</p>\n                <p>Glover was a target for both the new and old staff, as he was re-offered by the Nittany Lions in January. The Haymarket, Virginia, native notably included Virginia Tech in his top-six schools after being re-offered by James Franklin in addition to Georgia, Notre Dame, Oregon, Miami and Texas A&amp;M.</p>\n                <p>Pittsburgh native Jimmy Kalis, who plays for Central Catholic High School dropped a top six of Ohio State, Georgia, LSU, Texas, Clemson and Miami, but reports from both Steve Wiltfong of On3 and Brian Dohn of 247Sports said that Penn State is still in play. He was re-offered by the new staff, and is the son of former NFL offensive lineman Todd Kalis.</p>\n                <p>Visits materializing</p>\n                <p>After the February dead period, next up for 2027 recruits are spring practice visits and then summer official visits.</p>\n                <p>4-star cornerback Kei\u2019Shjuan Telfair, cornerback Semjay Robinson, running back Gary Walker and safety Rico Jackson have all added Penn State official visits to their schedule.</p>\n                <p>The aforementioned players will join Betton, 4-star wide receiver Khalil Taylor, 4-star safety Gabe Jenkins, 4-star safety Malakai Taufoou, 3-star running back Aiden Gibson, 3-star athlete Jonathan Galette and 3-star cornerback Zachary Gleason Jr. as high schoolers to lock in visits for the summer.</p>\n                <p>On the spring visit front, a pair of 4-stars made plans to return to State College in defensive end Mekai Brown and offensive tackle Layton von Brandt.</p>\n                <p>Brown was re-offered by the new staff after an in-home visit with Smith, and was in attendance for the Nevada game this past year. Per Chad Simmons of On3, he will be in town on April 3.</p>\n                <p>The visit to Happy Valley will have somewhat of a familiar feel for von Brandt, a previous commit. He was visited at school by Campbell and Clanton, and also had an in-home visit with Clanton. The offensive tackle has the Nittany Lions in his top-8 schools and will visit on April 18.</p>\n                <p>Targets committing elsewhere</p>\n                <p>Penn State made a late push to add 4-star 2026 Michigan State commit Samson Gash on campus for a visit in the middle of January before the February National Signing Day period. Gash\u2019s dad, Sam, played fullback for the Nittany Lions. He was never offered by the old staff, but picked one up in December.</p>\n                <p>Despite the late efforts, the receiver stuck with his pledge to the Spartans.</p>\n                <p>In the 2027 class, 5-star running back Kemon Spell, a former Penn State commit, pledged to Georgia. The in-state tailback from McKeesport was originally slated to visit for the first Junior Day in January, but couldn\u2019t make it due to the snowstorm that weekend.</p>\n                <p>Spell ended up visiting Georgia the next weekend, where he committed to the Bulldogs shortly after. There was buzz leading up to Junior Days that the running back would re-commit to Penn State as multiple national recruiting reporters logged predictions for him to do so.</p>\n                <p>A handful of reporters logged predictions for him to end up at Notre Dame before his first commitment to Penn State, so this recruitment seemingly has a long way to go.</p>\n                <p>It wouldn\u2019t be a shock if Spell found himself back on campus for a Penn State visit as well as pursue trips across the country due to his pedigree.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s last game at the Houston Invitational brought about the classic intrastate keystone rivalry against Pitt on Sunday afternoon. While the Nittany Lions entered the game leading the series record 19-9, they lost 16-8 last year in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>It wouldn\u2019t take long for Penn State to get some revenge, as the offense and pitching stayed hot and the Nittany Lions picked up the lopsided 11-2 win over Pitt in five innings.</p>\n                <p>Both teams carried momentum into Sunday, with the blue and white on a three-game win streak and the Panthers on a two-game win streak. Coach Clarisa Crowell started junior McKenna Young on the bump, while Pitt gave the ball to sophomore Gwen Sparks.</p>\n                <p>The Panthers jumped on Young early in the first and pulled ahead with production from their top batters. Tieley Vaughn smashed a one-out double over the head of center fielder Natalie Lieto, and Calle Henne followed with a single up the middle. Cleanup Gracie Helton delivered an RBI single through the left side, putting Pitt ahead 1-0.</p>\n                <p>Though Henne also scored off a sacrifice fly, Young minimized the deficit to 2-0. However, the blue and white\u2019s bats would quickly strike back in the bottom half of the first.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Allison Oneacre and junior Brooke Klosowicz both drew walks and set up sophomore Macy Chamberlin for a pivotal early opportunity to knock in runs. The Wauseon, Ohio, native came through with two outs and smoked a two-run double to the right-center gap, tying the game at two.</p>\n                <p>After Young provided a quick shutdown inning, Penn State grabbed hold of the lead in the second. With one out, junior Kaylie Walters sneaked a single down the left field line. Lieto followed her by blasting a two-run home run over the center field wall, giving the blue and white its first lead, 4-2.</p>\n                <p>Sparks was unraveling, so Pitt turned to its bullpen and brought in freshman Amelia Long to stop the bleeding. Yet, Penn State\u2019s offense jumped on the right-hander just as fast. Oneacre, the blue and white\u2019s leader in home runs, added to her total again.</p>\n                <p>The Alpharetta, Georgia, native launched her sixth home run deep into left field, extending the Nittany Lions\u2019 lead, 5-2. Long couldn\u2019t slow down Penn State as she hit Kirsten Finarelli, then Klosowicz followed with the third home run of the inning. The Panthers soon found themselves down 7-2, and the blue and white showed no signs of slowing down.</p>\n                <p>A pair of two-out walks gave freshman Breanna Hanik a chance to drive in even more runs. The Oak Lawn, Illinois, native slapped a double to left field and scored junior Michela Barbanente from second.</p>\n                <p>The game continued slipping further away from the Panthers and they made another pitching change, this time bringing in left-handed sophomore Bekah Duck. However, she wasn\u2019t able to keep the deficit at six.</p>\n                <p>Duck walked Walters on just five pitches, and she didn\u2019t get help from her defense after shortstop Shelby Frazier muffed a routine groundball, plating both Cara Bohner and Hannik. The eight-run inning finally ended with Duck striking out Oneacre, but the Nittany Lions took a commanding 10-2 lead into the third.</p>\n                <p>While Pitt couldn\u2019t produce any offense in the top half of the third, Penn State added another run later in the inning. Klosowicz whacked a one-out single up the middle and scored off three straight walks.</p>\n                <p>Despite the blue and white\u2019s offense dominating, fans shouldn\u2019t overlook how well freshman Brevyn Kellepouris pitched in relief. The Olathe, Kansas, native picked up the win with two strikeouts and allowed no runs and just two hits.</p>\n                <p>With the victory, the Nittany Lions take a 7-2 record back to Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State travels to Orlando, Florida, for the SpaceU Classic, with its first game against Charleston Southern at 2 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>For the third time in a little over a week, Penn State took the field in coach Kayla Treanor\u2019s first season in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions battled Bucknell inside Holuba Hall, coming out with a 21-9 victory to keep their undefeated season going.</p>\n                <p>While Bucknell won the opening faceoff, Penn State\u2019s defense outperformed the Bison in the opening minute, as freshman Susannah O'Connell forced a turnover. Penn State\u2019s offense went right down the field and put its first goal on the scoreboard with a free-position goal from junior Delaney Radin.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTwo players for us that are freshmen and have made a huge impact are Susannah O\u2019Connell and Rocquette Allen,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing like leaders right now.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Less than 30 seconds later, freshman Rocquette Allen took advantage of the blue and white\u2019s quick start, scoring her eighth goal of the season and putting Penn State up by two.</p>\n                <p>After both sides exchanged defensive success, junior Kelly MacKinney found the net again for the Nittany Lions, followed by Maddie Greco\u2019s second career goal to give Penn State a four-goal lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy teammates always push me to be better every day,\u201d Greco said. \u201cDrive (helps me) always want to reach a different level every game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Through five minutes, the blue and white dominated the game, holding the Bison to zero shots on goal, three turnovers and just one draw control.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe difference in the first half was completely draw controls,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cEmma Kelley had 13 in the first half and was completely dominant.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Bucknell\u2019s first look of success came midway through the first quarter with the shot clock expiring, as leading scorer Megan Krestinski came away with a last-second goal.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions fired right back, though, as Tewaaraton Award nominee Erika Ho netted her first goal of the game. After a quick score from the Bison, Ho scored her second goal of the game to make it a four-goal game.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Ho\u2019s) an excellent leader and that just carries a presence on the field that you can\u2019t deny,\u201d Greco said. \u201cShe\u2019s just an awesome player and an awesome person.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State earned its third free position shot of the day, as Wainman capitalized on the opportunity for her sixth goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>After a pair of missed shots by the Nittany Lions and a green card on Ho, the Bison played man-up and earned their third goal of the game before Allen\u2019s ninth career goal brought the lead back to five.</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and Bucknell missed a pair of free position shots to open the second quarter, but sophomore Ellie Wisch scored at the 11:41 mark, followed by another goal from Wainman.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 hot stretch continued as Allen scored her third goal of the game and 10th of her career, followed by Bucknell\u2019s first goal in 13 minutes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hard work that you have to do every single day,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it without any of my teammates.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Graduate transfer Anna Salerno became the ninth player to score for the blue and white, as she scored the fourth goal of the season. The Bison closed the half with their first free-position goal, cutting the deficit to single digits.</p>\n                <p>Going into the second half, Penn State made a switch at goalkeeper, putting sophomore Arden Jansen in the net, recording her first career save one minute into the period.</p>\n                <p>\u201cArden is another really great goalie,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cWe have a great goalie group, and I\u2019m proud of Arden. I thought she played very well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Greco earned her first career hat trick with her fourth career goal, followed by Allen\u2019s fourth and fifth goals of the day.</p>\n                <p>With a majority of backups taking the field, sophomores Maggie Rezza and Porter Rhoades each scored their first goals of the season while the Bison earned a pair of goals to end the quarter.</p>\n                <p>Those garbage-time goals continued into the fourth period, as Bucknell cut the deficit to 11 points with a running clock. After another goal from the Bison, Wisch\u2019s second goal of the game, and Hannah Hoyt\u2019s first collegiate goal, the Nittany Lions emerged victorious to win their third game of the year.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions return to Panzer Stadium for a matchup with Pitt at 5 p.m. Wednesday.

    "description": "<p>No. 6 Penn State wrapped up three straight top-five series matchups on Saturday, heading home from Ann Arbor, Michigan, with two straight losses against a top-ranked Michigan team, the first one coming in shutout fashion.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions dropped Saturday\u2019s match to the No. 2 Wolverines 6-3, sealing the victory and the majority of the points possible in the series.</p>\n                <p>A high-scoring first period was the theme of the weekend between the two Big Ten opponents. Following a four-goal opening frame on Friday night, the scoring started just over seven minutes in during the rematch.</p>\n                <p>Michigan got on the board first, after freshman forward Cole McKinney redirected a shot from defenseman Luca Fantili out in front.</p>\n                <p>The Wolverines doubled their lead about four minutes later, when junior defenseman Ben Robertson walked around a defenseman and into the crease of goaltender Kevin Reidler. Forward Nick Moldenhauer was there to clean the puck up and put it into the back of the blue and white net.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were there to respond just over a minute later, however.</p>\n                <p>Junior Casey Aman found forward Reese Laubach \u2014 who opened Penn State\u2019s scoring just 58 seconds into Friday\u2019s game \u2014 in the slot, and he fired a shot past goaltender Jack Ivankovic to cut the deficit back to one to end the first frame.</p>\n                <p>The second period was less action-packed, but the physicality picked up.</p>\n                <p>A high hit on junior forward Aiden Fink led to a challenge from the Nittany Lion bench for head contact early in the period, but the officials found no penalty on the play.</p>\n                <p>The game\u2019s first trip to the box came a few minutes later, after Laubach was called for slashing just past the halfway point of the second period, and Michigan\u2019s nationally ranked No. 3 power play unit was quick to capitalize.</p>\n                <p>A tic-tac-toe passing play from senior T.J. Hughes to Moldenhauer led to a goal in the slot from forward Jayden Perron.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions got their own chance on the man advantage as the clock ticked down on the middle frame when freshman Adam Valentini was called for holding.</p>\n                <p>With about a minute to go in the second period, the blue and white couldn\u2019t generate much, but started the final frame still with the extra man.</p>\n                <p>Despite some good chances, the blue and white couldn\u2019t get one through Ivankovic on the power play, but got another chance a few minutes later.</p>\n                <p>A hooking penalty on defenseman Dakoda Rh\u00e9aume-Mullen sent Penn State back to the power play with about 12 minutes to go; however, the extra man was negated 50 seconds later when forward JJ Wiebusch was called for a slashing penalty.</p>\n                <p>4-on-4 hockey didn\u2019t lead to much, but Michigan made quick work of its shortened power play.</p>\n                <p>Wolverine sophomore Will Horcoff sent a shot towards the net, and a redirection from a Nittany Lion defenseman gave Reidler little chance of stopping the home team\u2019s fourth goal.</p>\n                <p>Michigan maintained its third-period dominance and continued to pile on the scoring. This time, Valentini found the back of the net after collecting a loose puck and beating Reidler down low.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions refused to quit, however, and when they were given their third power play of the night after Horcoff was called for slashing, they got their first goal since the first period.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Luke Misa found Laubach out in front, who stuffed the puck past Ivankovic and cut into the Wolverines\u2019 lead for his second of the night, and third of the weekend.</p>\n                <p>Star forward Gavin McKenna continued the late-game surge for the blue and white after his shot from distance made it through traffic and into Michigan's net, cutting its deficit back down to two goals.</p>\n                <p>Despite the late push, an empty net goal from Moldenhauer sealed the 6-3 game for the home team.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns home to Pegula Ice Arena for an 8:30 p.m. puck drop on Feb. 20 against Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>It seemed like everything went wrong in Penn State\u2019s 15-3 season opener loss to Air Force, but the Nittany Lions had another opportunity to win their first game of the season against Grand Canyon on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>This game proved different as Penn State clicked on all cylinders behind two huge offensive innings and won 9-2 over Grand Canyon.</p>\n                <p>While the blue and white didn\u2019t start hot at the MLB Desert Invitational, the Antelopes won their first game over Northeastern. Under sunny skies in Arizona, a pair of right-handers got the start on the mound, with sophomore Ben Hudson for the Nittany Lions and junior Nicholas Robb for Grand Canyon.</p>\n                <p>Penn State went down quietly for the first few outs in the first, but senior Michael Anderson recorded his first hit as a Nittany Lion through the left side. Though cleanup Bryce Molinaro lifted a ball deep into right center, center fielder Griffin Cameron tracked down the ball well for the third out.</p>\n                <p>While the blue and white left a couple of runners stranded in the top half of the second, the Antelopes broke open the scoring later in the inning. Cannon Peery smacked a leadoff single through the right side, and despite Hudson striking out the next two batters, Max Charles split the left-center gap.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore\u2019s two-out RBI triple gave Grand Canyon the early 1-0 lead. However, Molinaro prevented Charles from scoring with a diving play at third, throwing out Camden Bates across the diamond.</p>\n                <p>Similar to the first two innings, the Nittany Lions threatened with base runners, but couldn\u2019t drive them in. Redshirt junior Cohl Mercado drew a leadoff walk, and Molinaro dropped a two-out hit into right center, but Jack Porter flew out to center to end the threat.</p>\n                <p>After another quiet offensive start, the blue and white\u2019s bats finally came through in the fourth. Junior Spencer Barnett reached base with a walk, and with not much offense happening, Barnett was aggressive and stole second. A few batters later, redshirt senior Justin Turcovski delivered with a one-out RBI single to center, tying the game at one.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, Hudson kept dominating on the bump and kept the score knotted. Through four innings, the Medford, New Jersey, native recorded five strikeouts while allowing just two hits and one walk.</p>\n                <p>For the first time this season, the Nittany Lions took the lead in the fifth. The Antelopes pulled Robb for senior Elijah Higginbottom at the start of the inning, and the blue and white pounced. Senior Jayden Davis started the momentum with a one-out single to right.</p>\n                <p>A few batters later, Molinaro recorded his second hit of the day off a two-out single up the middle, advancing Davis to third. Porter didn\u2019t waste the prime scoring opportunity, lining a RBI single up the middle and giving Penn State the 2-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>The scoring didn\u2019t stop there as Barnett powered a ball to the warning track and over the head of center fielder Cameron. The Pittsburgh native\u2019s two RBI triple was the blue and white\u2019s first extra-base hit of the campaign.</p>\n                <p>With the lead at 4-1, the Nittany Lions continued pouring on the runs. Following a walk by freshman Avery Smith, Turcovski carried the momentum and plated both runners off a triple to right field, ballooning the Penn State lead 6-1.</p>\n                <p>Following the explosive five-run inning, both offenses were kept quiet until the seventh. Redshirt senior Ben DeMell ran into a bases-loaded jam with no outs. Grand Canyon\u2019s comeback push started with a routine fly ball error by first baseman Barnett, which allowed Bates to reach.</p>\n                <p>Troy Sanders batted a long single to center and moved Bates to third. Followed by a walk by Cameron, Bates scored off a sacrifice fly to center fielder Mercado. Coach Mike Gambino brought in sophomore left-hander Matthew VanOstenbridge to face the heart of Grand Canyon\u2019s lineup.</p>\n                <p>The Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, native retired the next two batters and minimized the damage with Penn State\u2019s lead still comfortable at 6-2. However, the Nittany Lions added more insurance in the next inning.</p>\n                <p>Penn State delivered a three-run eighth inning against senior right-hander Luke Moeller. Starting with a one-out single from Davis, Molinaro continued his monster offensive day with a two-out single to center. Porter then smacked a double into the gap in center and drove in both runners, pushing the Nittany Lions\u2019 lead to 8-2.</p>\n                <p>After Porter advanced to third off a wild pitch, Kevin Karstetter took advantage of a rattled Moeller and sneaked an RBI single up the middle. He was stranded on second after a stolen base, but the blue and white took a large 9-2 lead late.</p>\n                <p>Grand Canyon wouldn\u2019t score again as senior Dimond Loosli threw two shutout innings and secured the blowout victory for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State wraps up its time at the MLB Desert Invitational against Kansas State at 2 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After sweeping Saint Francis last weekend in a one-and-one home and away series that saw Mark Pavlik picking up his 700th career victory, Penn State took to the road to head for Princeton, New Jersey, to take on the Tigers.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions squeaked out a 3-2 victory last night after winning the first two sets but losing the third and fourth, narrowly avoiding the reverse sweep.</p>\n                <p>It was much of the same on Saturday, as Penn State blanked Princeton 3-0 to complete the series sweep and drop the Tigers to 2-6 on the season.</p>\n                <p>Penn State played Princeton three times last season, when the two teams split the regular season series. The Nittany Lions got the last laugh in the EIVA Championship, where they picked up a 3-0 victory before appearing in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white got on the board first after an error on the opening serve from Nolan Kelly and held the lead until an Andrew Werner service ace tied the set at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>With the Tigers right on the heels of the Nittany Lions, 6-foot-7 Owen Rose got up for a monster block that gave the blue and white a two-point lead.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt senior middle blocker was named a \u201cPlayer to Watch\u201d in the EIVA in the preseason after being voted second-team all-EIVA last season.</p>\n                <p>Princeton took its first lead of the afternoon after an Owen Mellon service ace put the Tigers up 12-11 and held on to the advantage despite trading points back and forth. A Sean Harvey kill recaptured the lead for the Nittany Lions as they went up 17-16.</p>\n                <p>Kills were flying left and right as the blue and white took turns with the Tigers putting points on the board, including five from Tristan Hassell and four from Princeton\u2019s Ambrose Engling.</p>\n                <p>Neither team could pull away, with the score tied at 25-25 after two more Engling kills kept the nonstop action tight.</p>\n                <p>Finally, Penn State pulled away after a wild series of events kept things rolling, but a Mellon attack error blocked by Gabriel Gaige gave the Nittany Lions the 30-28 victory in the first set.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers quickly got out to a 2-0 lead in the early running of the second set after back-to-back kills from Ethan Wells and another from Werner.</p>\n                <p>After the initial alternating scores, it was all Penn State as it went on a 6-1 scoring run, powered by several kills from Jaidyn Bethel and Hassell that put the blue and white up 10-6.</p>\n                <p>Kelly, already having a big game, picked up his sixth dig and 17th assist of the afternoon before adding an ace to that list, which brought the Tigers within two points of Penn State\u2019s lead.</p>\n                <p>Unlike the suspense in the first set, the second frame was looking like it belonged completely to the Nittany Lions as they pulled ahead to a 17-11 lead before it dwindled down to just three points after a couple of errors from Bethel and Gaige and an ace from Werner.</p>\n                <p>Despite Princeton\u2019s efforts, Penn State extended its lead to 22-19 as it was on the doorstep of winning the first two sets just like Friday night.</p>\n                <p>A Hassell kill put a wrap on the second set as the Nittany Lions grabbed the second set, winning 25-21. Princeton moved closer after a Rose service error, but it didn\u2019t matter.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers and Sam Shweisky went into the third set looking to do something similar to Friday night when they nearly pulled off the reverse sweep, but with the blue and white on the brink of closing out the weekend with a series sweep, it wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got on the board first in the third set thanks to a Michael Schwob kill, but Princeton immediately matched the score with another Engling kill.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions extended their lead to 5-1 before Engling picked up his 10th kill of the evening just as Hassell picked up his 14th, a new career high.</p>\n                <p>In a rhythm since the start of the day, Hassell notched his 15th kill to add on to a career day as Penn State moved up to a 15-11 lead before a media timeout.</p>\n                <p>A Rose ace made things even gloomier for the Tigers as everything was going the Nittany Lions\u2019 way \u2013 even an Engling error on his serve that did his squad no favors.</p>\n                <p>Pavlik and the blue and white took a timeout after Princeton worked its deficit down to just one point after a bad angle on the attack from Hassell made it 18-17 in the latter stages of the third set.</p>\n                <p>Princeton brought the score closer in the final moments of the third set after a score that the officials had to take another look at was followed by another Werner kill that tied the frame at 24-24.</p>\n                <p>Some last-minute theatrics saw Harvey notch another kill that was matched with one from Wells that made it a 26-25 Princeton lead.</p>\n                <p>Just like the first set, the two sides kept the action alive until a Gabriel ace sealed the deal for the Nittany Lions, as they picked up a 28-26 win in the third set to sweep the Tigers in the match and the weekend.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns home on Friday to kick off a THON weekend series with Harvard.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions split their two regular-season matchups with the Crimson last season and also picked up a 3-0 victory in the first round of the EIVA tournament when the two teams met again.</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s match is scheduled for 6 p.m., while Saturday\u2019s is scheduled for 3 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, love is in the air, and surprisingly, that sentiment enchanted the hardwood all the way in Eugene between the two squads at the bottom of the Big Ten \u2013 Oregon and Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, as Shakespeare wrote, \u201cSome Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps,\u201d and it was Oregon that struck down the blue and white with an ambush in the clash of opportunities. The Ducks broke a ten-game losing streak and won their first Big Ten home game with the victory.</p>\n                <p>It didn\u2019t appear to be unfavorable for the Nittany Lions entering, as it started its full first unit of Kayden Mingo, Freddie Dilione V, Dominick Stewart, Josh Reed and Ivan Juri\u0107, which at times hadn\u2019t appeared all together due to injury.</p>\n                <p>That unit immediately clicked and cruised to a two-possession lead after roughly six and a half minutes of play, but empty offensive possessions couldn\u2019t nurse the lead, and Oregon fought back just before the midpoint of the half.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white retaliated, with a quick grasp of the reins following a bad decision by Oregon\u2019s Wei Lin to pass before the shot clock, and a crafty Mingo layup.</p>\n                <p>Yet the Ducks' leading scorer, center Nate Bittle, drained back-to-back three pointers to grab the lead. Bittle started in his third game back from injury and spearheaded the Ducks\u2019 offensive barrage on Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white defense continued to allow more open looks despite Mike Rhoades's adjustments, as three consecutive Oregon possessions with a bucket gave the Ducks the lead with just over six minutes left before halftime.</p>\n                <p>The two units traded buckets for two minutes until the Ducks ballooned their lead to ten, and the Nittany Lions appeared more lively on offense in their attempt to level the score before half.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, at the break, Oregon led 38-32 via Bittle\u2019s game-high 12 points, followed by bench guard Dezdrick Lindsay, who started with an efficient ten points. The senior\u2019s season-high all year was 14 points against Creighton, ultimately breaking that figure with 16 total points at the end of the game.</p>\n                <p>For the blue and white, it was its own guard-and-big pairing orchestrating the offense, with freshmen Mingo and Juric scoring 11 and eight points, respectively, at the half.</p>\n                <p>Ball movement is where the Ducks built their edge, with a combined team total of ten assists to Penn State\u2019s limited total of four.</p>\n                <p>Early in the second half, the Nittany Lions made it a one-possession game with a reenergized defensive effort led by their press.</p>\n                <p>The two squads traded buckets from beyond the arc and at the foul line, as it appeared Rhoades\u2019 squad began to play with more urgency. That pace didn\u2019t translate, as the Ducks kept the speed advantage where it mattered: the rate of buckets.</p>\n                <p>Bittle converted both shots of a one-and-one attempt at the foul line, and a Juri\u0107 travel on the other end didn\u2019t help, as a slam by Sean Stewart of Oregon followed to give them the largest lead of the day at ten.</p>\n                <p>Takai Simpkins, who logged only two first-half points, largely led the offensive attack with 15 points throughout the midpoint of the second half. The sharpshooter anchored an efficient team shooting approach that outshot Penn State by over 20% from three.</p>\n                <p>The game got rather physical, as Juri\u0107 and Stewart each picked up their fifth fouls, leaving both units without a major presence down low aside from Bittle.</p>\n                <p>With just under five minutes left to play, Oregon expanded to a 15-point lead and only had to avoid a major catastrophe to bring home the win.</p>\n                <p>The Ducks prioritized wasting time on the clock, with slow ball movement and handles to drive the result home.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State, Mingo finished with a team-high 24 points, tied for a career best. While Oregon was led by Bittle and Simpkin\u2019s 22 points each.</p>\n                <p>Availability Report</p>\n                <p>The lone player joining redshirt Reggie Grodin on the sidelines is forward Tibor Mirtic, who should be returning soon, as he entered Saturday\u2019s contest as questionable due to a shoulder injury sustained in practice.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The blue and white return to Happy Valley at 6 p.m. on Wednesday for a clash with fellow bottom of the Big Ten team Rutgers in the Nittany Lions\u2019 \u201cAcademic Achievement Night and Faculty Staff Appreciation Night.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Love was in the air on the Valentine\u2019s Day regular-season finale for No. 4 Penn State and there was no better display of companionship than Katelyn Roberts and program history.</p>\n                <p>After having their hearts broken by Cassandra Kehler during overtime in Friday\u2019s matchup between the two AHA competitors, the Nittany Lions concluded their regular season on a high note with a 4-2 win.</p>\n                <p>With an assist on the game\u2019s first goal, Roberts became the sixth skater in program history to reach the century mark milestone and is the first African-American player to do so. Coach Jeff Kampersal was left speechless while putting together what Roberts means to the team.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I (have) words to describe the immense impact that she\u2019s had on the program,\u201d Kampersal said.</p>\n                <p>He further broke down Roberts not only by who she is on the ice as a player, but also by who she is off the ice as a person.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a power forward, great shot, really elite passer,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cOff the ice, she\u2019s the greatest connector of all time. I\u2019ve been coaching 30 years and she just brings everybody together. I can\u2019t speak highly enough of her.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kampersal and the Nittany Lions will go through a two-week hiatus as they await the results of the first two rounds of the AHA Tournament. As the regular season champions, Penn State has an automatic bye into the semifinal, where it will face the lowest remaining seed after the first round and quarterfinal round on Feb. 19 and Feb. 21, respectively.</p>\n                <p>It is a two-week break that Kampersal said would feature \u201cpure rest\u201d. While he plans to hold his regularly scheduled practices during the week, the Nittany Lions coach realizes he\u2019s working with a team that\u2019s missing three forwards to the Olympics and Mya Vaslet, who suffered an injury last Friday against Lindenwood. Her timetable to return is yet to be determined.</p>\n                <p>Kampersal explained that with the increase in demand out of his underclassmen during games, practices have been disjointed to accommodate the rise in production from some of the bottom-six forwards. He also explained the potential mental impact those practices have, as well as the impact from an academic standpoint.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe just kind of get in a bad mindset. Again, today the vibe was completely different,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cI think they had a big academic week, so just (the team) just kind of need rest, and then we\u2019ll get going the week after.\u201d</p>\n                <p>On the second power play opportunity for the Nittany Lions, Roberts sent a pass from the far corner to Kendall Butze, who ripped a shot from the faceoff dot. Her shot hit a body in front, and Abby Stonehouse tucked the puck in for the goal.</p>\n                <p>Approximately two minutes after getting on the board, Sophie Morrow handled the puck in the offensive zone and held until she found a clear lane. Once she did, Morrow\u2019s wrist shot went off the stick of Grace Outwater to extend the Penn State lead to 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Outwater\u2019s conference-leading 24th goal of the season came a game too late after her nine-game goal streak was snapped in the overtime loss on Friday. However, the sophomore started a new streak back on a line with Maddy Christian and Mikah Keller, a line that has been successful this season with a combined 51 goals this season.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white opened the second period with an extra skater after a Brac Kelley penalty for face masking toward the end of the first. They kept the momentum going with high-danger scoring opportunities, including a 2-on-1 chance for Roberts and Stonehouse, but Brenna McNamara held Penn State\u2019s lead at two in her ninth career start.</p>\n                <p>Across the ice in the other crease, Katie DeSa stopped each of the first nine shots she faced through the first 30 minutes of play until RIT entered the zone on a 2-on-1.</p>\n                <p>Tilli Ker\u00e4nen and Ireland Stein entered their offensive zone with Taya MacDonald as the only skater back for the Nittany Lions. DeSa stopped Ker\u00e4nen\u2019s initial shot with her glove, but couldn't contain it, as Ker\u00e4nen lobbed it over DeSa\u2019s glove for the easy goal from Stein.</p>\n                <p>The Penn State netminder redeemed herself with a set of spectacular saves while shorthanded after Roberts was assessed a penalty for interference, but the Tigers learned from their mistake and took advantage of the next power play they received just a minute later.</p>\n                <p>With McKenna Walsh in the box after a tripping call, Stein beat DeSa with a shot that erased Penn State\u2019s lead and tied the game at two late in the second period.</p>\n                <p>Butze was on the ice for a dangerous play in front of the Penn State bench between Roberts and Olivia Urbach. She decided the best way to retaliate was on the scoreboard with her fifth goal of the season to give Penn State a 3-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>The second line magic sparked again just 28 seconds into the third period on Christian\u2019s 19th goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>Outwater and Keller played catch while cutting toward the net until Outwater\u2019s backhand attempt was denied at the doorstep by McNamara. Just then, Christian, who tailed Outwater, put the rebound in the top shelf to recapture the Nittany Lion two-goal lead.</p>\n                <p>They would hold on to this lead with the aid of DeSa, who held the Tigers scoreless in the third period.</p>\n                <p>With this win, Penn State finishes the regular season with a 29-5 record, one that will still be impacted by postseason play. However, one record that is solidified is its conference record, which finished the regular season at 22-2, with both losses coming in overtime.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will host the best-of-three semifinal round against the lowest remaining seed, with Game 1 on Feb. 27 and the time of puck drop to be announced.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Following a dominant 14-1 victory over Lafayette on Saturday afternoon, Penn State had a quick turnaround facing co-host Houston Christian at the Houston Invitational. The Huskies remained winless on the season after falling to Pittsburgh and Michigan on Friday.</p>\n                <p>In a strong defensive outing, the Nittany Lions defeated the Huskies 4-1.</p>\n                <p>Junior Bridget Nementh got the start for Penn State in her third appearance of the weekend, as Houston Christian turned to sophomore Leah Hammack.</p>\n                <p>Hammack and the Huskies' defense quickly recorded two outs to start the opening frame. However, the Nittany Lions\u2019 young bats stepped up big once again.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Allison Oneacre singled up the middle, and was followed by back-to-back doubles from freshman Kirsten Finarelli and sophomore Macy Chamberlin, giving the blue and white an early 2-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Brooke Klosowicz worked a single to put two runners in scoring position for Cara Bohner, but instead Hammack recorded her second strikeout of the inning.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defense held momentum in the bottom of the frame, recording a 1-2-3 inning.</p>\n                <p>Houston Christian recorded a quick out to start the second, but back-to-back singles from Gabby Gradishar and Kaylie Walters put two runners on for Natalie Lieto. The Huskies escaped the jam by recording a double play.</p>\n                <p>Nemeth and the Nittany Lions\u2019 defense had another flawless outing in the bottom of the frame, forcing Houston Christian to go three-up, three-down.</p>\n                <p>In the top half of the third, Chamberlin recorded her second two-out double of the game, but the blue and white couldn\u2019t bring the catcher around to score.</p>\n                <p>Maddy Bailey got the Huskies on the offense going with a leadoff double in the bottom of the frame. Bailey advanced to third on a single from Hammack, but two strikeouts and a groundout prevented Houston Christian from getting on the board.</p>\n                <p>Hammack and the Huskies\u2019 defense posted their first clean sheet of the game, not allowing any Nittany Lions on base in the fourth to keep a tight 2-0 battle.</p>\n                <p>Ella Herrewig reached base after an error from Klosowicz at third, but Houston Christian couldn\u2019t find any further momentum, sending things back to Penn State for the top of the fifth inning.</p>\n                <p>Oneacre ripped a two-out double down the left field line for her second hit of the game, and was brought home on a single from Finarelli.</p>\n                <p>Finarelli reached third after an error from Hammack, but couldn\u2019t find her way home after Chamberlin grounded out to the left side.</p>\n                <p>In the bottom of the frame, the Nittany Lions recorded their third 1-2-3 inning of the afternoon, as Nemeth\u2019s statline stood at two hits, two strikeouts and zero walks.</p>\n                <p>Klosowicz extended Penn State\u2019s lead just three pitches into the sixth inning with a home run to left field for her third long ball of the season.</p>\n                <p>With one out, junior second baseman Michela Barbenente knocked the Nittany Lions\u2019 fifth double of the afternoon, but a lineout from Gradishar and ground out from Walters prevented any more runs from reaching the plate for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Defense continued to be the name of the game for Penn State in the bottom of the sixth, completing yet again another three-up, three-down inning that was topped off by a groundout to Nemeth.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions entered the final frame with their two, three, four hitters up and a chance to extend their lead.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Natalie Lieto started the inning with an infield single, but got out at second after a fielder\u2019s choice off the bat of Oneacre.</p>\n                <p>Following a strikeout from Finarelli and a groundout from Chamberlin, the blue and white couldn\u2019t do any damage, but still held a four-run cushion heading into the final chance for Houston Christian\u2019s offense.</p>\n                <p>Penn State recorded two quick outs, but a home run from senior Karlie Barba kept the Huskies alive.</p>\n                <p>Houston Christian couldn\u2019t do anymore damage, with Hammack grounding out to third base, completing the Nittany Lions' strong defensive effort.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will wrap up its Houston trip with a battle against in-state rival Pittsburgh at 1 p.m. Sunday.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>As the calendar turned to 2026 and the Big Ten wrestling season continued to play out, the eyes of the nation had Feb.13 circled as the potential best dual of the season between No. 1 Penn State and No. 2 Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>Up until Friday, the meet was expected to be a close one, before injuries turned the potential shootout into a celebration of Penn State wrestling, as 16,006 fans witnessed how far ahead of the rest of the country the Nittany Lions really are.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really thankful for everyone who showed up, the record crowd was awesome,\u201d Cael Sanderson said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the tickets were very cheap either.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The showcase ended with the breakout of Penn State\u2019s heavyweight that everyone in the Lorenzo Wrestling Center has been waiting to see.</p>\n                <p>Originally, No. 12 Cole Mirasola was facing the potential of having a dual-deciding bout against No. 3 Nick Feldman, but with Penn State leading Ohio State 33-5, Mirasola looked to claim victory all for himself.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI watched my teammates just do what they do,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cThis is what I live for, a sold out Bryce Jordan Center, I\u2019ve wanted to do this my whole life.\u201d</p>\n                <p>However, Mirasola was one of the few Nittany Lions that weren\u2019t favored to win. A portion of the crowd was skeptical of Penn State\u2019s heavyweight as well, with one fan quipping before the dual, \u201cwe can leave before the last match\u201d as his friends grew impatient in line. Mirasola has had many chances to defeat a top-tier heavyweight, but hadn\u2019t gotten the job done entering Friday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some losses this year, but I feel like I\u2019m right there,\u201d Mirasola said.</p>\n                <p>Feldman, meanwhile, is a national championship contender who has beaten common opponent AJ Ferrari of Nebraska twice this season. Mirasola fell to Ferrari at the last BJC dual.</p>\n                <p>The concern for Mirasola at heavyweight was him being undersized compared to the top of the class. However, according to Jeff Byers of the Penn State radio broadcast, Mirasola only gave up nine pounds to Feldman. The match would be a test of pure skill on the mat.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of story again,\u201d Sanderson said Wednesday. \u201c(Mirasola) just has to trust in his gameplan and what he does well, which is a lot of things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Regulation of the match went as many high pressure wrestling matches do, with the only scoring coming via escape. Feldman spent much of the match retreating from an aggressive Mirasola, narrowly avoiding a takedown in the final seconds.</p>\n                <p>Once the match hit sudden victory, Mirasola lost his patience and Feldman lost his footing. Mirasola got the takedown seconds into the extra frame, while Feldman laid on the ground in shock.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI knew the whole time that I had him,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cI looked at his face and he was gone.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The crowd that might\u2019ve doubted Mirasola stood and applauded him as he celebrated the 4-1 victory, and all doubts about his place in the lineup were put to bed as the night came to a close.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson spent weeks touting Mirasola\u2019s potential, but the proof hadn\u2019t arisen in results prior to Friday. After the dual, Sanderson gleamed pridefully as the wrestling world finally witnessed what he had been preaching all season \u2014 Mirasola is a threat at heavyweight.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHis ability to win scrambles and attack the legs as a big guy shows that he has a ton of potential,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe\u2019s very offensive-minded and will shoot right away, and we love that about him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The victory capped off the Big Ten Dual Meet Championship victory. Mirasola celebrated the seemingly annual achievement with his team.</p>\n                <p>That title isn\u2019t the only one the team is hoping to carry and after the win, Mirasola has more confidence in his ability to win a few titles of his own. The redshirt freshman had his defining moment in the Bryce Jordan Center, but bigger stages are still to come for Mirasola.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to win the national title,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cLosses aren\u2019t going to define me. I\u2019m really excited to see what happens for me.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

Penn State improved to 2-1 on the season while Princeton fell to 0-1.</p>\n                <p>First half</p>\n                <p>Penn State took early advantage of Princeton\u2019s young defensive core, keeping possession and continuing to drive to the net as the Tigers\u2019 defense failed to slide when their first defender was beaten.</p>\n                <p>Luke Walstrum kicked off the game with a goal 43 seconds in as he wrapped around the cage and beat his matched defender to free his hands for an overhand shot. Hunter Aquino, the reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year, delivered his first goal of the game less than a minute later to take a 2-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>After the second goal, the Tigers got the ball. Tucker Wade streaked down the center of the box and ripped an underhand shot under freshman goaltender Preston Hawkins\u2019 stick to cut Penn State\u2019s lead to one.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white elected to slow the pace of play on both sides of the ball, allowing Hawkins to routinely clear the ball and the offense to settle in. The switch worked as the Nittany Lions blazed on a six-goal run.</p>\n                <p>Hobart-transfer John Jude Considine drove hard towards the cage under tight coverage but beat goalie Ryan Croddick. It was followed by Kyle Lehman, shooting overhand through traffic.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Jack Iannantuono picked up a loose ball from Princeton\u2019s failed clearance and bounced a shot under Croddick\u2019s stick to take a commanding 5-1 lead. Walstrum followed that up, driving from behind the cage with a step on the defender. No slide came his way as he pinpointed the top right corner to take a five-goal lead with 5:39 remaining in the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>After Owen Fischer slashed Liam Matthews, Michael Faraone was credited with a man-up goal to end the quarter, as Finn Fox tried to swat down his interior pass but delivered an own-goal instead.</p>\n                <p>Nate Kabiri got Princeton off on the right foot in the second quarter, receiving a pass from his long-time teammate Colin Burns before sniping a shot over Hawkins\u2019 stick.</p>\n                <p>The majority of the second quarter was back-and-forth. Croddick made a series of saves as Princeton\u2019s defense limited Penn State to the outside, although the Tigers\u2019 offense experienced the same turbulence.</p>\n                <p>Iannantuono brought energy back to the Nittany Lions with 7:42 remaining in the half as he scored his second goal of the game while falling to his back to take an 8-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Faraone \u2014 after Matthews and Patrick Carragher nearly added their first goals of the day \u2014 capped off an intense possession with a wide-open shot to give Penn State its largest lead, 9-2, of the game with 2:21 left in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Kabiri ensured that the Tigers entered the locker room with the last goal as he bounced a tight-angle shot past Hawkins to cut the lead to 9-3.</p>\n                <p>Second half</p>\n                <p>After Hawkins made a chest save on the doorstep, Aquino took the ball from the top of the box and knifed through the defense before finding the bottom right corner of the net to take a 10-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>Hawkins and the Nittany Lion defense continued to shine, as All-American defender Alex Ross cleanly stripped Kabiri of the ball for his third caused turnover of the game.</p>\n                <p>Princeton had a trio of golden opportunities but all were turned aside by Hawkins. First, the netminder made a save but fell to his back before diving to make a stick save on Burns from point-blank range. Then, Hawkins made a foot save to keep the seven-goal lead.</p>\n                <p>However, Burns earned the Tigers\u2019 fourth goal of the game, firing a mid-range shot past Hawkins.</p>\n                <p>Chad Palumbo scored his first goal of the game on the man-up in the fourth quarter after Aquino took a 30-second penalty for pushing from behind. Peter Buonanno tallied Princeton\u2019s third-unanswered goal after driving past Will Costin. Wade carried the momentum on a four-goal run</p>\n                <p>Carragher stalled Princeton\u2019s energy with an individual effort, scoring a diving goal with one-second left on the shot clock. Aquino claimed a hat trick on a goal reminiscent of Matt Traynor\u2019s in last season\u2019s NCAA Quarterfinal, shooting one-handed while falling to the ground to take a 12-7 lead.</p>\n                <p>Matthews iced the game with 3:36 remaining in the game, scoring on a tight-angle shot to increase the lead to six. Hawkins closed out the game with 11 saves on 18 shots, for a .611 save-percentage.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are set to close their two-game road trip against Navy at noon on Saturday, Feb. 21, in Annapolis, Maryland.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Coming off a 1-1 Friday outing, Penn State returned to the field on Saturday morning to face in-state foe Lafayette in Houston. The Leopards went 0-2 in their opening slate of the Houston Invitational, falling to Incarnate Word and Houston.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions defeated the Leopards 14-1 in five innings.</p>\n                <p>Freshman right-hander Mackenzie Duncan got the starting nod for Penn State after earning the win against Houston on Friday night. The Leopards turned to sophomore right-hander Jordan Goedel.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions got first licks, and junior shortstop Kaylie Walters worked a four-pitch walk to get things going. Sophomore Natlie Lieto followed suit, but Lafayette recorded an out after Walters got caught stealing second base.</p>\n                <p>Freshmen Allison Oneacre and Kirsten Finarelli recorded the third and fourth straight walks of the inning, bringing up junior Michela Barbanente with bases loaded and one out.</p>\n                <p>The Leopards escaped the scare after a ground ball to Goedel resulted in a 1-2-3 double play.</p>\n                <p>Duncan walked sophomore Caroline Hall to start the bottom half of the first, but the Penn State defense stood tall, following with three straight outs.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions put two runners on in the top of the second, thanks to a walk from Cara Bohner and a single from Brooke Klosowicz, but with first and third and one out, Lafayette once again ended the threat with a double play.</p>\n                <p>Following two free bases and a double from senior catcher Maggie Klug, the Leopards loaded up the bases with just one out in the bottom of the second frame.</p>\n                <p>Duncan battled Olivia Catalina with a full count, with the Nittany Lion ultimately losing the fight to walk in the first run of the game. This called for coach Clarisa Crowell to go to the bullpen, bringing in sophomore Abigail Britton.</p>\n                <p>Britton only had to face one batter, with Hall grounding into a double play to end the inning.</p>\n                <p>Penn State answered quickly as Walters worked another walk, and scored from first on a double from Lieto.</p>\n                <p>Lafayette wasted no time bringing in a new arm, calling sophomore Makayla Lecky to the circle.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions brought in another run after Lieto advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on a sacrifice fly from Oneacre, giving the blue and white a 2-1 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Britton only needed four pitches in the bottom of the third, as the Penn State defense recorded its first 1-2-3 inning.</p>\n                <p>Klosowicz led off the fourth with a walk, and a sacrifice bunt from catcher Madison Seidel turned into another Nittany Lion run. Lafayette second baseman Kylee Sweet committed a throwing error, allowing Klosowicz to find her way home.</p>\n                <p>That wasn\u2019t close to the end of the fourth inning, scoring for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Following back-to-back two-out singles from Walters and Lieto, Oneacre drove one down the left field line for an RBI double.</p>\n                <p>Just moments after, Finarelli knocked a three-run home run for her second long ball of the weekend, breaking the game open to give the Nittany Lions a 7-1 edge.</p>\n                <p>The Leopards made their second pitching change of the day, bringing in freshman Andy Hegarty, who didn\u2019t allow any more damage.</p>\n                <p>Lafayette couldn\u2019t build off a lead-off single from junior third baseman Katie Harrington, keeping the blue and white\u2019s six-run lead intact heading into the fifth.</p>\n                <p>Penn State needed just two runs in the fifth inning to reach the run rule margin, and the Nittany Lions reached that mark in no time.</p>\n                <p>A single from Klosowicz and a walk from Macy Chamberlin brought up freshman Gabby Gradishar with a chance to record the first RBI of her collegiate career. Gradishar did just that, knocking an RBI double.</p>\n                <p>Gradishar was followed by an RBI single from Jordyn Jochims to extend Penn State\u2019s lead to 9-1.</p>\n                <p>Two straight walks from Hegarty allowed for another Nittany Lions run and forced another Lafayette pitching change.</p>\n                <p>Junior Parker Rowden entered to face Finarelli, who grounded into a fielder\u2019s choice, but still recorded her fourth RBI of the game.</p>\n                <p>A double from Barbanente and a fielder's choice from Jordan George brought in three more runs to give Penn State a 14-1 lead heading into the bottom of the fifth.</p>\n                <p>Britton didn\u2019t allow any Leopards on base in the fifth, completing the Nittany Lions' run-rule victory.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will have a quick turnaround, facing Houston Christian at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Following a 36-5 win over Ohio State, Penn State flocked to the center of that mat with each wrestler wearing either a blue or white jumpsuit.</p>\n                <p>Standing in the middle was 174-pounder Levi Haines, who hoisted the trophy for the Nittany Lions, clinching the regular season Big Ten title. Surrounding him were his teammates, who had their arms around each other and boasted beaming smiles.</p>\n                <p>The chemistry of the group has stood out in the 2025-26 campaign, and on Friday evening, it pushed Penn State to a blowout win over the previously undefeated Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a great team. Our culture is the friendship, and the camaraderie is \u2014 I don't think it's ever been anything close to what we have right now,\u201d Cael Sanderson said. \u201cI think a lot of it has to do with all the changes in college athletics, and the kids are coming here because they want to be here and they want to be a part of something special.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The buy-in from the coaches, wrestlers and strength staff is what Sanderson believes makes the team as great as it is. There\u2019s an endless support system stemming from the Lorenzo Wrestling Complex, and it shows year after year, with Penn State bringing home 12 national championships under Sanderson\u2019s reign.</p>\n                <p>A tight-knit group is the goal each season, and that\u2019s been on display with this year\u2019s bunch, with encouragement being at a premium from the wrestlers. In front of a sold-out crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center, one in which totaled 16,006 fans that set the NCAA wrestling indoor attendance record, that support was on display.</p>\n                <p>It pushed guys like No. 1 Luke Lilledahl over No. 2 Nic Bouzakis at 125 pounds, No. 4 Marcus Blaze past No. 2 Ben Davino at 133 pounds and No. 12 Cole Mirasola over No. 3 Nick Feldman at heavyweight.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're getting a lot of like-minded people that fit in with what we're trying to do,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cThey're close and they care about each other, and they want to see each other win. That's what makes your job fun as a coach, is seeing a team that cares about each other, and their parents want to see the other kids win and that kind of stuff. It's special.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The investment has made the program historically one of the most dominant dynasties across all collegiate sports. Sanderson has concocted a recipe that builds success year in and year out.</p>\n                <p>And it\u2019s entertaining for those who step into Rec Hall and the Bryce Jordan Center. In the steamrolling of the Buckeyes, Matt Campbell, Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics Pat Kraft and UFC fighter and former Penn State wrestler Bo Nickal were in the building. Kyle Snyder, who was an Ohio State wrestler and now wrestles for the Nittany Lion Wrestling Club, was sporting a Penn State hat as he watched from his seat.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s the daily grind filled with sweat equity for the wrestlers. There\u2019s the flash of what it takes to wrestle in the blue and white singlet. But as Mirasola explained, it starts with the coaches pouring everything they have into the wrestlers.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur coaching staff is the best in the world,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cCan't thank any of them enough for what they do for us. Love our coaches. Love our staff and love all of our team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Friday brought buzz to a dual that Penn State hadn\u2019t seen in a significant period of time. There was some noise that Ohio State could hang with the Nittany Lions, but despite being the No. 2 team in the country, Penn State showed there\u2019s a true gap between it and everyone else, proving why it\u2019s the No. 1 team nationally.</p>\n                <p>Next Friday, the Nittany Lions will host Princeton at 7 p.m. at Rec Hall in what will more likely than not be a tune-up match before heading into the Big Ten Championships at the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>The matchup against the Buckeyes gave Penn State a taste of what the postseason will feel like, but in the meantime, the wrestlers will ride the support of each other in pursuit of the greater goal \u2014 a Big Ten title and a national championship win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a close group, and a lot of obviously tough battles tonight, and our guys fought hard,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe're able to go find those points at the end, and really good matches. So, that's something we need to keep doing as we prepare for the postseason.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

The Lititz, Pennsylvania, native then retired the next three batters, bringing the Nittany Lions back to the batter\u2019s box, where they recorded another three outs.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened the top of the third with a ground out, but quickly fell behind as Fitzgerald recorded back-to-back base on balls.</p>\n                <p>Back at the top of the lineup, Zapp recorded the first of two outs, bringing Penn State back to bat.</p>\n                <p>After a groundout by Kevin Karstetter to start the bottom of the third, the Nittany Lions looked to score after a single from Nate Voss turned into a third-base opportunity after a stolen base and a balk by Air Force\u2019s Gaines Estridge.</p>\n                <p>Mercado started the top of the lineup with a walk, putting runners at first and third base.</p>\n                <p>However, Penn State\u2019s scoring opportunity was put to rest as Mercado was thrown out trying to advance to second base.</p>\n                <p>Air Force quickly responded to that threat with its own scoring run, which found success in the top of the fourth. While throwing no outs, Fitzgerald walked Burdine, who stole second base, and allowed another pair of runners on base as he ultimately scored.</p>\n                <p>Up 1-0, the Falcons took advantage of Fitzgerald\u2019s poor pitching and earned another run, leaving two on base as junior Kyle Emmons came on in relief of Fitzgerald.</p>\n                <p>Fortunately for Air Force, Emmons wasn\u2019t having any luck either, as a throwing error allowed T.J. Oster to score and made it a three-run game.</p>\n                <p>Emmons escaped the top of the fourth with a pair of outs, sending the Nittany Lions back to bat. However, Porter, Bryce Molinaro and Spencer Barnett each recorded an out, giving the Falcons another chance to score.</p>\n                <p>Junior Mason Horwat, who recorded four wins in his 11 starts this year, took the mound for Emmons and was walked all over by Air Force.</p>\n                <p>Horwat recorded one out before allowing three runners on base, each who scored and took a 6-0 lead to the bottom of the fifth.</p>\n                <p>With four innings down, Penn State only recorded one hit, and that abysmal record continued as just Voss made his way onto the base from a hit. Outfielder Justin Turcovski recorded a walk, but both were sent back to the dugout after a Mercado flyout.</p>\n                <p>With the Nittany Lions back on the mound, Horwat let another pair of runners find their way home as Air Force pulled ahead by eight runs. After two outs by Davis and Porter, Molinaro walked onto base, but Penn State was sent back with its third out.</p>\n                <p>Penn State tabbed its fourth pitcher of the night in freshman Ethan Bauerschmidt, who started strong with a pair of outs. However, the Falcons found their way back on the scoreboard after an error by Molinaro sent Trip Garrish home, followed by three more runners.</p>\n                <p>In the bottom of the seventh, the Nittany Lions scored their first two runs of the day off Karstetter and Voss. Through the two scores, Penn State only recorded one hit, but Air Force had a walk, a wild pitch and hit Voss with the pitch.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 attempted comeback continued with another run by Turcovski, but freshman pitcher Robert Brown III let in another four runs for Air Force, taking a 15-3 lead for the mercy rule.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>Penn State continues the MLB Desert Invitational with a 3 p.m. matchup against Grand Canyon on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>The opening game for Penn State at the Houston Invitational ended in a tough walkoff loss, but the Nittany Lions had a chance to get back in the win column against Houston on Friday night. For the second straight game, the blue and white faced an undefeated squad with the Cougars entering the contest at 6-0 after a win over Lafayette earlier in the day.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions clicked on all cylinders and ran away with a lopsided 10-2 win over Houston.</p>\n                <p>While Coach Clarisa Crowell opted to start an experienced pitcher in Bridget Nemeth, Houston started freshman London Park on the bump. The Nittany Lions broke through offensively with their first crack at Park in the game.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Allison Oneacre batted in all four runs for Penn State in its loss to Incarnate Word and she wasted no time picking up where she left off in the first. Sophomore Natalie Lieto walked on four pitches and Oneacre hammered a two-run home run deep into center, which gave the blue and white the early 2-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>After Nemeth shut down the Cougars quietly in the bottom half of the first, the blue and white\u2019s bats went right back to work in the second. Junior Brooke Klosowicz hit a dribbler up to Park, who opted to throw out Cara Bohner at second, but Klosowicz caught the Cougars\u2019 defense off-guard and advanced into scoring position.</p>\n                <p>With one out, senior Madison Seidel battered a single through the left side and drove in Klosowicz to extend Penn State\u2019s lead 3-0. Seidel turned on the jets and made it to second off the throw home, but a couple of groundouts ended the scoring.</p>\n                <p>While the Nittany Lions added on to their lead, Houston cut into their lead in its very next half inning. Despite having the count at 1-2, cleanup Makenna Mitchell drilled a double to the right-center gap, putting early pressure on Nemeth. Then Kylei Griffin walked on five pitches, making it second and first with no outs.</p>\n                <p>After Ronnie Esparza grounded out to second baseman Michela Barbabente, Leilani Garcia sent a ball back to Nemeth, who opted for the out at first, but in doing so plated Mitchell in from third. However, Nemeth kept the lead at 3-1 with her second strikeout to retire the side.</p>\n                <p>Houston went to its bullpen in the third, bringing in redshirt senior Paris Lehman to face the top of the blue and white\u2019s lineup. However, Penn State\u2019s freshmen continued producing huge offensive numbers. Lieto walked for the second time in the night and freshman Kirsten Finarelli launched a two-run home run deep into center, punching right back and making it a 5-1 game.</p>\n                <p>Crowell also turned to her bullpen and called upon freshman Mackenzie Duncan to face the Cougars\u2019 lineup in the third. While the Winter Garden, Florida, native started the inning off strong with a strikeout, Ariel Redmond blasted a high pitch far into left field to keep Houston in striking distance, 5-2.</p>\n                <p>However, Duncan locked back in and retired the next two Cougars. While the Nittany Lions couldn\u2019t drive Seidel in from second in their half of the fourth, Duncan collected two strikeouts in the bottom half of the inning and kept the lead at three.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State was shut down for a few innings, the bats came back alive in the fifth and poured on the runs. After loading the bases with three walks and just one out, Houston called upon senior Nicole Bodeux to face power hitter Klosowicz. The Johnsburg, Illinois, native delivered for the Nittany Lions with a two-run single to right and made the lead 7-2.</p>\n                <p>The scoring didn\u2019t stop there as a two-out wild pitch by Bodeux allowed Bohner to score from third, 8-2. The Cougars prevented any more runs from scoring, but they couldn\u2019t cut into the lead as Duncan and freshman Brevyn Kellepouris provided a joint shutdown inning.</p>\n                <p>It didn\u2019t take long for Penn State to pour it on even more in the sixth. After a few walks, Barbabente flared a one-out single to shallow right and scored Oneacre from second. With an error by first baseman Griffin, Finarelli advanced to third and then scored on another wild pitch.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white didn\u2019t score for the rest of the inning, but took a large 10-2 lead into the bottom half of the sixth. Kellepouris secured the victory for the Nittany Lions with three groundouts and Penn State improved to 5-2 on the season.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>Penn State continues its schedule at the Houston Invitational against Lafayette at 1 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Head coach Jeff Kampersal began his postgame statement in a common thankful mood; however, it quickly changed when discussing the game against RIT. In his lengthy, immediate comments on the 3-2 overtime upset loss, Kampersal didn\u2019t sugarcoat the reason he felt his team lost.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought it was a distracted vibe today,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cA couple of our teammates (are) playing games in Italy and not being necessarily locked in. I thought we were ready, but we weren\u2019t necessarily ready to play.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Before the puck dropped on Game 1 of the final regular season series, the Penn State bench looked short with three players in Italy for the Winter Olympics. Additionally, Mya Vaslet was ruled out of the game due to an \u201cupper body injury.\u201d With a smaller bench comes additional minutes on individual shifts, ultimately leading to tired skaters.</p>\n                <p>It took until the second period for No. 4 Penn State to record its first goal of the game against RIT. The early momentum for the Nittany Lions quickly shifted towards the Tigers after they were able to score two unanswered goals. RIT spent the majority of the second period in the lead.</p>\n                <p>However, Katelyn Roberts tied the game in the last seconds of the period. After a scoreless third period, overtime approached. Nearly four minutes into the overtime period, Cassandra Barnes found the net with her game-winning goal.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers were able to utilize power play opportunities to add to the scoreboard as one of their three goals came on the man-advantage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey have a dynamite power play,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cWe take too many penalties, so it caught up with us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions came into the game giving up the second-most penalties in the conference. While RIT leads the conference in power play goals with 35.</p>\n                <p>With one game left in the regular season and the playoffs quickly approaching, a loss like this gives Kampersal cause to call on his team to use it as an example of what they need to shape up.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe play good defense, but we give second chances because we try to make fancy backhand passes or we pass to the person we\u2019re supposed to be covering,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThat is what we have to shape up because we play a certain way and get away with it until we get out of the lead, and then we get smacked in the head for it. So, we got to go back to playing good habits.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions face a quick turnaround as they begin Game 2 against RIT on Saturday at 3 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

The duo each jumped 1.70 meters, finishing in fifth place.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s high jump, freshman Trip Campbell finished eighth out of 17 competitors, jumping 2.11 meters.

    "description": "<p>No. 15 Penn State opened its two-game series against Princeton with a 3-2 win after going the distance in five sets on Friday.</p>\n                <p>The first set opened with a kill from Sean Harvey, but the Tigers responded immediately to open up some back-and-forth scoring.</p>\n                <p>Gaige Gabriel and Matthew Luoma came up with a big block to pull the blue and white ahead 5-2. But again, Princeton responded by scoring the next three points to tie it.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions answered back, scoring the next four points with a kill from Jaidyn Bethel and a few blocks.</p>\n                <p>Up 9-6, Owen Rose responded to a Tigers\u2019 kill immediately with a massive kill of his own. Following the first service ace of the match from Luoma, the blue and white went up 11-7.</p>\n                <p>Kills from Luoma and Rose allowed the blue and white to keep a steady lead during the early moments. But Gabriel and Luoma's attacking errors allowed the Tigers to get back within two, making the score 14-12.</p>\n                <p>At 18-14, with Penn State leading after kills from Luoma, Gabriel and Bethel, the Tigers called their first timeout.</p>\n                <p>A kill and service ace scored the Tigers back-to-back points as they looked to diminish the Penn State lead, but it was too wide for any recovery.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions took the first set 25-19 with a kill from Tristain Hassell to close it.</p>\n                <p>The second set of play opened with back-and-forth scoring, but Penn State pulled away 6-3 after a kill from Gabriel and a block from Rose and Bethel.</p>\n                <p>Princeton\u2019s response was immediate, and the blue and white\u2019s lead was shut down with three back-to-back points from the Tigers, tying it up at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>From there, scoring went back-and-forth once more, with each point from either side seeing an immediate response from the other. But after kills from Luoma and Bethel, and an ace from Harvey, the blue and white pulled away 14-11.</p>\n                <p>But again, Princeton managed to shut down the lead in quick fashion, tying it back up at 15-15.</p>\n                <p>After a few more points, the Nittany Lions challenged a point that would put the Tigers back within one at 18-17. After a long pause to review the contested point, the point stood, closing the blue and white\u2019s lead by just one.</p>\n                <p>Penn State quickly took back a larger lead again after a Princeton service error and an ace from Rose, forcing a timeout from the Tigers.</p>\n                <p>After back-to-back points from the Tigers to get back within one at 21-20, the Nittany Lions called a timeout as the end of the set approached.</p>\n                <p>After a few quick points, Princeton called their second timeout of the set at 23-21, hoping to pull ahead and take the second set.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions, however, were quick to shut things down. The second set ended with a service error from Princeton, allowing the blue and white to take the set 25-22.</p>\n                <p>The third set opened with more back-and-forth scoring from both sides, and the score remained relatively close through several points. But four back-to-back points from the Tigers gave them an 8-5 lead.</p>\n                <p>After continuing to dominate with a 12-8 lead, the Nittany Lions called their first timeout of the set to regroup.</p>\n                <p>And regroup they did. The Nittany Lions came off the timeout and closed the lead to 13-11 with the help of some errors from Princeton and a kill from Luoma.</p>\n                <p>It wasn\u2019t long after that that the Tigers shut down any hopes of a Penn State recovery. After several points, they took a six-point, 21-15, lead and forced yet another timeout from the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was able to close the lead within two with an ace from Hassell and multiple kills, and after two long rallies, the Nittany Lions were within one at 23-22.</p>\n                <p>After a valiant effort from Penn State, the Tigers took the third set 25-23, forcing a fourth.</p>\n                <p>The fourth set opened in a similar fashion, with scoring remaining relatively close. But after three back-to-back points from the Tigers, they pulled ahead 12-9.</p>\n                <p>While Hassell and Rose were able to make some big kills, the lead stayed with the Tigers, 15-12, as a media timeout hit the court.</p>\n                <p>Tying things up after the break, the blue and white were back in it. But after Princeton retook the lead 19-16, Penn State called a timeout.</p>\n                <p>After more back-and-forth, Princeton took the fourth set 25-22, forcing a fifth and final winner-takes-all set.</p>\n                <p>The fifth set saw an early ace from Michael Schwob and big kills from Gabriel and Bethel to take an early lead 6-3.</p>\n                <p>Gabriel produced a number of crucial blocks, allowing the blue and white to take the lead by six at 9-3. And once the blue and white got going, it couldn\u2019t be stopped.</p>\n                <p>With the lead at 14-11, Penn State was looking at match point. And with his 22nd of the night, Harvey closed out the match with a kill.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions return tomorrow for a Saturday, Valentine's Day clash to close out the series against Princeton.

    "description": "<p>With four games left in the season, Penn State is eyeing every matchup as an attempt to get one step closer to the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>On Sunday, the Lady Lions will have another chance as they take on Northwestern at 4 p.m. in the Pink Zone game.</p>\n                <p>Despite historically dominating the Wildcats, this weekend\u2019s matchup may be one of the closest in the teams\u2019 history, as both squads sit at eight wins on the year.</p>\n                <p>All-time matchups</p>\n                <p>While the Lady Lions fell to Northwestern last year, they\u2019ve been historically dominant against the Wildcats.</p>\n                <p>Since the two started playing in 1979, Penn State has built a 42-13 all-time record. During the past seven seasons with coach Carolyn Kieger, Northwestern has won six times while the blue and white\u2019s come out victorious just four times.</p>\n                <p>Before Kieger\u2019s time in Happy Valley, the Lady Lions experienced 13 straight wins against Northwestern. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, Penn State had a similar experience, winning 12 straight matchups.</p>\n                <p>2025-26 Northwestern</p>\n                <p>Similar to Penn State, the Wildcats have been among the worst teams in the Big Ten, with an 8-16 record this season.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern started the season strong with seven straight wins, but lost seven straight games to end 2025. After defeating Rutgers and Wisconsin to earn their only wins of the conference season, the Wildcats have lost six straight heading into Sunday\u2019s matchup.</p>\n                <p>Despite the team\u2019s overall struggles, senior Grace Sullivan has been a star for the Wildcats, averaging 22.2 points per game.</p>\n                <p>As the second-lowest scoring team in the conference at 65.5 points per game, Sullivan averages over one-third of Northwestern\u2019s scoring on any given night.</p>\n                <p>Sunday\u2019s matchup</p>\n                <p>After Sullivan, only junior Casey Harter averages double digits with 10.1 points per game. In last year's contest with the Lady Lions, she recorded 10 points, with five of them coming from the charity stripe.</p>\n                <p>Of this year\u2019s Penn State returners, only Gracie Merkle, Vitoria Santana and Moriah Murray saw action against them, combining for 25 points.</p>\n                <p>It was a low-scoring matchup last year, just 69-63, and this Sunday\u2019s matchup could be similar with two of the lower-ranking teams in the conference.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State, the key to success will be limiting Sullivan. Without her, Northwestern could potentially be held to 50 or fewer points. But on the other hand, if Merkle, Murray and Kiyomi McMiller are held quiet, the rest of the Lady Lions will struggle to produce.</p>\n                <p>Pink Zone</p>\n                <p>While Sunday\u2019s contest should be a close contest between a pair of eight-win teams, it will also remember and celebrate those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPeople understand how big of a game it is, but I don\u2019t think people really understand that we really aren\u2019t playing for ourselves,\u201d Murray told The Daily Collegian. \u201cBefore the game, getting to walk through the practice gym and seeing all of the people who have fought cancer or are still fighting, it really means a lot to me and my teammates.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Organized by the Pa.

    "author": "Chase Fisher | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Sixth-ranked Penn State, after its last bye week of the regular season, traveled north to Ann Arbor for a top-six matchup against No. 2 Michigan on Friday, the first of two games at Yost Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Yost Ice Arena has been a haunted house for the Nittany Lions in the past, as heading into Friday\u2019s contest, they owned a 7-16 record in Ann Arbor since joining the Big Ten. However, they won three contests on the road against the Wolverines last season, including a series sweep in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>That success in Ann Arbor continued on Friday, but it resulted in just a tie in the NCAA standings. A back-and-forth thriller ended with a Michigan 4-4 shootout victory.</p>\n                <p>First period</p>\n                <p>Penn State was in full throttle offensively to begin Friday\u2019s matchup, which set the tone for the first period.</p>\n                <p>After the Wolverines cleared their defensive zone just 50 seconds into the game, left wing Matt DiMarsico reentered with the puck and kicked it out to right wing JJ Wiebusch at the right dot. Wiebusch patiently waited, then fed center Reese Laubach across the ice for a one-timer, putting the Nittany Lions in front 1-0.</p>\n                <p>After approximately nine minutes of back-and-forth play, Michigan finally struck back. Right defenseman Drew Schock skated into free ice by the left circle and fired a wrist shot, where right wing Garrett Schifsky tapped the puck into the back of the net off a rebound and past goaltender Josh Fleming, tying the game 1-1.</p>\n                <p>The programs exchanged two goals in the next four minutes following Schifsky\u2019s tally. Left defenseman Jackson Smith was the first to score, taking control of a Wolverine turnover in his offensive zone and sniping a goal from a tough angle by the bottom of the right circle.</p>\n                <p>His goal gave Penn State a 2-1 lead and moved him into first all-time in school history for the single-season record of most goals by a defenseman, scoring his ninth on Friday.</p>\n                <p>The glory and excitement didn\u2019t last for long, however, as Big Ten leading scorer T.J. Hughes scored on a 5-on-3 from another impressive angle. Hughes' goal was the last of a first frame that featured fireworks.</p>\n                <p>Second period</p>\n                <p>The second period began with Penn State fending off a multitude of penalties, which included killing Wiebusch\u2019s five-minute major and game misconduct that he took towards the end of the first frame.</p>\n                <p>After those hardships, the Nittany Lions retook the lead via a goal from an unexpected player \u2014 fourth-line center Nic Chin-DeGraves. The scoring opportunity stemmed from left wing Shea Van Olm generating a takeaway in the Wolverines defensive zone.</p>\n                <p>Van Olm skated towards the left dot and then fed Chin-DeGraves, where he roofed the shot past Michigan goaltender Jack Ivankovich to give Penn State a 3-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>However, a mere three minutes later, the Wolverines answered, just as they had the entire game.</p>\n                <p>Center Michael Hage, a Montreal Canadiens former first-round pick, skated around the right side of the boards and fed right defensemen Asher Barnett by the left dot, where he beat Fleming and tied the game 3-3.</p>\n                <p>Third period</p>\n                <p>Michigan took its first lead of the contest at the 10:21 mark of the third period, scoring a goal after a turnover from left wing Lev Katzin, which led to a 4-on-2 rush for the Wolverines.</p>\n                <p>Left wing Malcolm Spence led the high-danger opportunity, shooting the puck at Fleming, which was initially saved. Hughes swatted the rebound into the back of the net to give Michigan a 4-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>After six minutes of game time and seven combined penalties, Penn State responded on the power play.

    "title": "No. 1 Penn State wrestling wins Big Ten regular season title, snaps No. 2 Ohio State's undefeated record",
    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>No. 1 Penn State against No. 2 Ohio State received a lot of hype for multiple weeks leading up to the dual. However, with multiple Buckeye wrestlers out with injury, the dual became less intriguing for the national audience.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions continued their dual winning streak in front of an NCAA-record crowd of 16,006 fans with a 36-5 score over Ohio State. The win clinched the Big Ten regular season championship</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how the dual went down.</p>\n                <p>125 pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 2 Nic Bouzakis (OSU)</p>\n                <p>The dual kicked off with the most anticipated match of the night, No. 1 vs. No. 2. The wrestlers didn\u2019t give up any ground and traded attacks at each other but neither found any success.</p>\n                <p>Both earned an escape point and with a minute left in the seven-minute time, which made it look like it\u2019d go to sudden victory. As time was expiring, Lilledhal secured a takedown, but the clock hit zero before he fully got to Bouzakis.</p>\n                <p>After motioning to keep the match moving, Lilledahl got the takedown, and sent the sold-out BJC crowd into a frenzy.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got out in front 3-0.</p>\n                <p>133 pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 2 Ben Davino (OSU)</p>\n                <p>A similarly paced match occurred at 133 pounds. Marcus Blaze and Ben Davino sat at 1-1 as time expired in the normal seven minutes.</p>\n                <p>Sudden victory showcased more of the same \u2014 two highly touted wrestlers who\u2019ve faced each other in the past, not giving up a single inch. Tiebreakers would decide the match.</p>\n                <p>Blaze started on top and could only keep Davino down for nine seconds, meaning he\u2019d have to escape before nine seconds in the second tiebreaker. Blaze couldn\u2019t escape prior to the nine seconds, but grabbed Davino\u2019s leg and reversed him, keeping him down for the final seconds and pulled off the victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s lead doubled to 6-0.</p>\n                <p>141 pounds: No. 12 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 1 Jesse Mendez (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Things began to open up scoring wise at 141 pounds. Jesse Mendez, one of the favorites for the Hodge Trophy, completely outmatched Braeden Davis.</p>\n                <p>Mendez utilized a first-period takedown to get things started. An early escape in the second period put the Buckeye up 4-0. A second takedown, followed by three-nearfall points put Davis into a hole.</p>\n                <p>Davis couldn\u2019t control the overpowering Mendez who notched a final takedown in the third period to get the 18-2 tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 6-5.</p>\n                <p>149 pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. Brogan Fielding (OSU)</p>\n                <p>What was expected to be a top-10 matchup between Shayne Van Ness and No. 6 Ethan Stiles didn\u2019t happen. Stiles didn\u2019t wrestle and Van Ness took advantage of a backup wrestler in Brogan Fielding, who wrestled up a weight class.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lion led 3-0 with over a minute of riding time after the first period, before finding more offense in the second frame. Three takedowns and an escape put the top-ranked wrestler up 13-3 after the second period.</p>\n                <p>He capitalized on multiple stalling calls, and finished off Fielding with a takedown to win by tech fall, 20-5 at the 6:17 mark.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s lead extended to 11-5.</p>\n                <p>157 pounds: No. 4 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Daxton Chase (OSU)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke also faced a wrestler who wrestled up a weight class. No. 1 Brandon Cannon remained out of the lineup for Ohio State, and just like Van Ness, Duke took advantage.</p>\n                <p>The freshman showcased his offensive repertoire, taking down Daxton Chase five times in the opening period. Duke added another takedown and before taking down Chase a seventh time, grabbed his arms and put him on his back. Duke\u2019s pinfall gave Penn State a 17-5 lead heading into the intermission.</p>\n                <p>165 pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 16 Paddy Gallagher (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink continued his dominant season with his match against Paddy Gallagher. It was all Mesenbrink in the opening period, as two stall calls and one takedown gave him a 4-0 lead with 2:47 in riding time.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink escaped Gallagher and notched another takedown in the second period to extend his lead. He added a third takedown in the third period and despite pushing for a tech fall, had to settle with a major decision with a 12-2 victory.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink\u2019s victory extended Penn State\u2019s lead to 21-5.</p>\n                <p>174 pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. T.J. Schierl (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines took on an unranked wrestler in T.J. Schierl after Carson Kharchla was announced as the starter prior to the dual.</p>\n                <p>Haines held an 8-1 lead after one period with over two minutes of riding time, dominating Schierl. He continued that dominance into the second period, pushing for a fall. After a lengthy time holding Schierl on his back, the Buckeye returned to his stomach and the whistle blew.</p>\n                <p>Haines\u2019 four-nearfall points sealed the 16-1 tech fall, giving the Nittany Lions a 26-5 lead.</p>\n                <p>184 pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 8 Dylan Fishback (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh faced his former team for the first time in his career after transferring to Penn State in the offseason.</p>\n                <p>Dylan Fishback secured the first takedown of the match and held over a minute of riding time before leading 4-0 after his second-period escape. Welsh pushed for points following that, but couldn\u2019t find success until the third period.</p>\n                <p>After escaping Fishback\u2019s grasp, he notched his first takedown to knot things up at 4-4. Welsh released the Buckeye, giving Fishback the 5-4 lead before taking him down with under 30 seconds to go.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lion rode out Fishback and took the 7-6 decision over his former teammate.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s lead pushed to 29-5.</p>\n                <p>197 pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 10 Luke Geog (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr continued to prove he\u2019s in a tier of his own at 197 pounds.</p>\n                <p>An early takedown gave him the lead and he never looked back. He added a takedown in the second period to extend his lead to 7-0, still holding his shutout.</p>\n                <p>A third-period takedown sealed things, earning yet another top-10 win with an 11-2 major decision victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State extended its lead, 33-5.</p>\n                <p>285 pounds: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. No. 3 Nick Feldman (OSU)</p>\n                <p>A rematch of last season\u2019s heavyweight matchup during Penn State and Ohio State\u2019s dual, Cole Mirasola faced Nick Feldman, this time as the starter.</p>\n                <p>That result was a 10-3 decision in Feldman\u2019s favor, holding a significant size advantage on the smaller Mirasola.</p>\n                <p>This year\u2019s edition saw a much closer bout. With 1:30 remaining on the clock, the match sat at 1-1, with Mirasola coming close to a takedown on multiple attempts.</p>\n                <p>The heavyweights went to sudden victory before Mirasola finished on a takedown attempt, avenging his loss from last season to end the dual on a high note for the Nittany Lions with a 4-1 sudden-victory win.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took the dual with a dominant 36-5 victory.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey returned to Pegula Ice Arena for its final regular-season series against RIT, squaring off in Game 1 at 6 p.m. Friday.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019s perfect record on home ice fell as RIT rallied to defeat Penn State, 3-2, in overtime. Penn State falls to 28-5 on the season and 21-2 in the AHA.</p>\n                <p>Penn State played with a noticeably smaller roster than usual, with Tessa Janecke, Matilde Fantin and Nicole Hall representing their respective nations in the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games. Mya Vaslet was also scratched for her second-straight game, prompting coach Jeff Kampersal to move Danica Maynard from defense to left-wing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe had a distracted vibe tonight with some of our teammates playing games in Italy,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cWe weren't necessarily locked in.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The length of the first period flew by with limited scoring opportunities on both ends of the ice. Although the majority of the possession time was spent in RIT\u2019s zone, the Tigers\u2019 defensive unit controlled the netfront presence. On the other hand, Penn State was highly successful on the breakout and made key blocks to protect goaltender Katie DeSa.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were awarded their first power play with 13:12 remaining in the period. While Taylor Lum entered the zone with the puck along the wall, Addie Alvarez delivered a crushing body check, which resulted in a minor penalty.</p>\n                <p>However, the power play was unsuccessful as the Tigers routinely shut down all of Penn State\u2019s advancements.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 best opportunity of the period came with only 29 seconds remaining in the frame. Grace Outwater blazed through the neutral zone on a 2-on-1, dishing a pass to Maddy Christian, who fired a shot that goaltender Brenna McNamara saved with the shaft of her stick.</p>\n                <p>All it took was a small amount of \u201cpuck luck\u201d for Penn State to break the ice early in the second period.</p>\n                <p>Christian received a pass from Danica Maynard before taking it behind McNamara\u2019s crease. The Elk River, Minnesota, native performed a wraparound maneuver and tucked the puck between the short-side post and the goalie\u2019s skate to take a 1-0 lead with 16:17 remaining in the second period.</p>\n                <p>But the Tigers pounced quickly to tie the game just under four minutes later. Madison Buziak fired a shot from the blue line that bounced off a defender, splashing into the top corner of the net over DeSa\u2019s glove.</p>\n                <p>Katelyn Roberts was sentenced to two minutes in the penalty box for interference, and Penn State\u2019s first penalty kill of the evening didn\u2019t go according to plan. The Nittany Lions failed to clear the zone, and Ireland Stein tapped in the loose puck past DeSa to take a 2-1 lead with 8:48 remaining.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe need to handle adversity and stay out of the box,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cBecause that's in our losses. We're getting killed taking penalties and teams already make us pay. We haven't learned that lesson.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s second power play of the game, resulting from an interference call on Tilli Keranen, was unsuccessful as the Nittany Lions were unable to generate offense.</p>\n                <p>However, Roberts avenged RIT\u2019s previous power-play goal by netting one of her own. She took the puck from the top of the right face-off circle and sniped the top-right corner of the net to even the tides, 2-2.</p>\n                <p>To kick off the third period, Zoe Ziotas received an interior feed for a short breakaway on DeSa. She deked to the right of the goalie but was stopped on the doorstep to keep the score tied.</p>\n                <p>DeSa continued to shine when Leah Stecker took a cross-checking penalty with 15:57 remaining in regulation, making a series of desperation saves. Meanwhile, Abby Stonehouse had a shorthanded breakaway but came up empty.</p>\n                <p>Penn State went back on the penalty kill, as Outwater was handed a minor penalty for elbowing, but the blue and white dominated time-on-attack despite playing 5-on-4.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions spent the remaining regulation time on offense, pressing deep into RIT\u2019s zone. After a series of scoring chances, the buzzer sounded and the teams entered a 3-on-3 overtime frame.</p>\n                <p>Although Penn State controlled possession for the majority of the frame, Cassandra Barnes dealt the finishing blow, ripping a shot under DeSa\u2019s glove to hand the blue and white its first home defeat.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'm assuming our seniors will take care of it,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cI gave it to them pretty good at the end of the game, but they know that I don't play and hopefully they'll take care of it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Vaslet wasn\u2019t listed to dress due to an undisclosed injury.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to Pegula Ice Arena to close out its regular season with Game 2 against RIT at 2 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The quarterfinals of the 2026 Winter Olympics started off with a low-scoring game between Team Sweden and Team Czechia. The two Nittany Lions, Nicole Hall and Jessica Adolffson, advanced to the semifinals as they continued to represent Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Focus quickly shifted over to the two remaining Penn Staters, Tessa Janecke and Matilde Fantin, as Team USA faced the host country, Team Italy. Janecke, representing Team USA, contributed to the Stars and Stripes\u2019 dominance throughout the preliminary round as it entered the game undefeated through four games.</p>\n                <p>For Fantin and Italy, it has been the opposite. Italy entered the quarterfinal game against the USA with a record of 2-2. However, Fantin has made a name for herself by scoring three goals in her four games.</p>\n                <p>The Americans spent nearly the entire game in their attacking zone, leading to a 6-0 shutout victory over Team Italy.</p>\n                <p>The opening 10 minutes started as some would expect, with a dominant USA offense against a struggling Italy team. Gabriella Durante had to stand on her head as she was bombarded with continuous shots.</p>\n                <p>That was until Megan Keller broke the ice for the USA. Following a faceoff win in the offensive zone, Laila Edwards sent a pass over to Keller that was blasted to the back of the net in an instant.</p>\n                <p>A one-sided opening period came to a close after a sprawling stick save from Durante robbed Abbey Murphy with under 20 seconds to go. USA poured on 20 total shots in the first period, only finding the net once.</p>\n                <p>Team USA got its next two goals of the game off the stick of Kendall Coyne. The four-time Olympian found herself in the right spot at the right time on back-to-back goals.</p>\n                <p>Edwards soon followed with a goal of her own after a swift wrist shot from the high slot beat the right shoulder of Durante. Immediate \u201cUSA\u201d chants filled the arena following the fourth goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>The Americans were not done scoring. This time on the penalty kill, Britta Curl found the loose puck and scored on a wrap-around attempt. Italy followed this goal with its first shot on net in the period with seven minutes left on the clock.</p>\n                <p>Fantin had one of Italy\u2019s best scoring chances of the period as she found herself behind the defense. The Como, Italy, native\u2019s quick wrist shot was denied by the right pad of Gwyneth Philips.</p>\n                <p>The middle frame came to a close after a post-whistle scuffle between the teams ensued following a Hannah Bilka goal with over a minute and a half left. The Americans went into the final intermission ahead of Italy 6-0.</p>\n                <p>It was all said and done heading into the third period. USA continued to suffocate Italy in its defensive zone, leading to a late power play for the Americans.</p>\n                <p>Although Janecke was held off the scoresheet, the Orangeville, Illinois, native contributed to the offensive attack, totaling four shots by the end of the game. As with the first 40 minutes, the remaining 20 were spent in the attacking zone for USA as it added to its shot total.</p>\n                <p>By the final buzzer, the Americans tallied 51 shots to Italy\u2019s 6 in a dominant display of offense heading into the semifinals.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Janecke will meet fellow Nittany Lions Hall and Adolffson in the semifinals, as Team USA plays Team Sweden. No matter the outcome, a Penn Stater will play for a gold medal with their respective country.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After a successful 4-1 opening weekend, Penn State had a chance to carry its momentum into the Houston Invitational against Incarnate Word on Friday afternoon. While the Cardinals entered the game undefeated at 7-0 and had a chance to extend their winning streak.</p>\n                <p>While the blue and white entered the seventh up three runs, Incarnate Word rallied and plated four runs in the inning to walk off the Nittany Lions 5-4.</p>\n                <p>Both squads sent out right-handed pitchers in the circle. Coach Clarisa Crowell gave the ball to junior McKenna Young, while senior Bella Mitchell faced the Nittany Lions. Both pitchers had a handful of appearances in the young season before this game and delivered quality outings.</p>\n                <p>The first inning brought little offense for either lineup. Junior Michela Barbabente singled up the middle, but Mitchell swiftly retired the next two batters. However, it wouldn\u2019t take long for the blue and white\u2019s bats to get going as Penn State struck in the second.</p>\n                <p>One of the early storylines in the Nittany Lions\u2019 season is the impact of the freshmen offensively, and the narrative continued. Sophomore Natalie Lieto kicked off the inning with a hard double down the left field line, then freshman Allison Oneacre smashed a two-run home run deep over the center field wall and gave Penn State the 2-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Though the blue and white scored no more runs in the inning, the offensive pressure didn\u2019t stop there. Graduate student Cara Bohner walked on six pitches, and freshman Breanna Hanik also drew a one-out four-pitch walk as Mitchell seemed rattled. Following a sacrifice bunt, Barbabente had a chance at driving in both of them from second and third, but flew out to left field.</p>\n                <p>After gaining some cushion from her offense, Young ran into some trouble in the bottom half of the second. The Brodhead, Wisconsin, native walked leadoff Bryanna Fuentes on four pitches, and while she forced a groundout to shortstop Kaylie Walters, Dominique Guerra still reached first. With two outs, Carmen Uribe found a gap in left center, but Young struck out Aynsli Lawson with a runner in scoring position to end the inning.</p>\n                <p>It was the Oneacre game as she made more damage in the third. With the heart of Penn State\u2019s lineup due up, Incarnate Word brought in right-handed senior Sam Portillo in for relief. Lieto reached base on a fielder\u2019s choice, then advanced to second on a wild pitch.</p>\n                <p>With one home run already under her belt, Oneacre stepped in with more on her mind. The Alpharetta, Georgia, native blasted another two-run home run deep into left field, making the blue and white\u2019s lead 4-0. The top recruit of Penn State\u2019s 2025 class has shown early why she was ranked so high out of high school, with three homers already credited to her name.</p>\n                <p>While the Nittany Lions extended their lead in the top half of the third, the Cardinals got on the board in their half of the inning. Young walked Ayla Gonzales on five pitches, and with her team down four runs, she was aggressive and stole second. While Young struck out the next batter, she lost control and hit Jaisy Caceres.</p>\n                <p>Cleanup hitter Fuentes delivered with two outs and singled to right center, driving in Gonzales and bringing the Cardinals closer, 4-1. After Fuentes stole second, Young locked in and struck out Dominique to strand the runners in scoring position.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white were aggressive on the base paths in the fourth and had an opportunity to add more runs, but cleanup Brooke Klosowicz flew out to center and left Kirsten Finarelli stranded on second.</p>\n                <p>Crowell turned to her bullpen again and brought in freshman Mackenzie Duncan for the bottom half of the fourth. The Winter Garden, Florida, native ran into a small jam after she walked a few batters, but got Victoria Altamirano to fly out to Lieto in center.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions flashed some glove and kept Incarnate Word from scoring in the bottom of the sixth. After Duncan hit the leadoff batter, Prisais Quintero smacked a double to the left-center gap, but Lieto quickly rallied the ball to Walters at shortstop, who then threw out pinch runner Guerra at home. Prisas made it to third off the sequence, but sophomore Abigail Britton mowed down the next two Cardinals.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Jenny Robledo shut down the blue and white\u2019s bats over three innings, totaling two strikeouts and surrendering just one hit. While Penn State was quiet on offense, Incarnate Word made it a game in the seventh.</p>\n                <p>Gonzales started the rally with a leadoff single down the left field line, and Altamarino came up clutch and launched a two-run home run into deep center. With the lead now at just one run, Crowell turned to her most reliable arm, junior Bridget Nemeth. However, she couldn\u2019t stop the bleeding and Sydney Zenon hit a rocket into left field and tied the game at four.</p>\n                <p>The game was quickly unraveling for Penn State as Caceres doubled to left-center. The Cardinals now had the game-winning run on second with no outs after entering the last inning down three. With the game on the line, Crowell brought Young back in hopes of extending the game to extras.</p>\n                <p>However, Fuentes singled to center, which advanced Caceres to third and she was brought home for the game-winning run off a sacrifice fly, leading to a 5-4 loss for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State looks to bounce back against Houston for the second game of its doubleheader at 7 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State faces practically its greatest opportunity of the season on Valentine's Day, when the Nittany Lions get a chance to finally form results on their schedule that they could maybe say they love on its second-ever Big Ten West Coast road trip.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white found success on their first-ever trip to Washington. On the same day Seattle hosted the Super Bowl parade, Penn State marched to a late-game win, its second conference win of the year in spectacular fashion.</p>\n                <p>Now, Penn State hits the Oregon trail to face the Ducks in Eugene for the first time, and the outlook for the contest looks mixed, with little positive narratives entering, but still huge implications when both teams leave.</p>\n                <p>Finding gold on the west, falters on the fault line</p>\n                <p>The sunny skies of the Golden Coast have cast their rays in the new era of westward Big Ten expansion, as squads expand into new horizons, but for others, the lights have been too bright.</p>\n                <p>Last season, the first year that former Pac-12 units appeared on the Nittany Lions\u2019 Big Ten schedule, the blue and white dropped both of its games on the West Coast against UCLA and USC \u2013 both teams that beat it in Happy Valley this season.</p>\n                <p>In 2024-25, Penn State also fell to Washington. While it redeemed itself on that front this season, with the win in this year\u2019s edition of the clash with the Huskies marking its first against those new conference teams, the second rendition of the Oregon game appears to continue that trend.</p>\n                <p>Host Oregon hasn\u2019t had a good season; this time last year, it\u2019d just fallen out of the AP Poll before eventually navigating back a month later, and if it endured that fate this year, that would\u2019ve been comparatively tame to the struggles it's endured on the hardwood.</p>\n                <p>This season\u2019s Ducks are the lone squad currently with only one conference win after the Nittany Lions recently dumped them to be alone in that group. It gets even worse \u2013 Oregon is also the lone squad not to post a home or neutral-site Big Ten win, bad news for the Ducks, as a rejuvenated blue and white squad arrives in town.</p>\n                <p>On the contrary, Oregon needs to get its ducks in a row, with ten straight losses, the worst streak in the Big Ten, the scenery has been anything but verdant in the Evergreen State, as every result axed all growth it's attempted. The lone game among that stretch to be decided by one possession was the first of the streak, which was also their first game of the new year.</p>\n                <p>Misery loves company, and the Ducks can at least share criticism with a team like Rutgers, which is the only other Big Ten unit that hasn\u2019t yet courted a Quad 1 win.</p>\n                <p>While the narratives entering Eugene surely benefit Penn State, it still faces only a one-in-four chance of winning, according to ESPN.</p>\n                <p>Injuries, player personnel, analytics</p>\n                <p>Oregon arrives in this game extremely banged up, and it doesn\u2019t look like it will get any better; most of the four players listed as available in its last game against Indiana have been confirmed as likely to miss extended time. The lone one not to have any status to be confirmed, Miles Johnson, hasn\u2019t appeared all season.</p>\n                <p>Headlining the unit of absences for the Ducks is Jackson Shelstad. The junior averaged over 15 points, four assists and a steal per game through his 12 appearances, having not appeared since 2025.</p>\n                <p>While the Ducks won\u2019t have their flashy guard, they\u2019ll have their big man, as 7-footer Nate Bittle returns to Eugene for the first time in over a month after injuries nagged his season. The senior made his return to action from a foot injury two games ago, and over that pair of outings, Bittle averaged 19 points, 6.5 rebounds, four assists and 34 minutes.</p>\n                <p>The veteran center surely will be a problem for Penn State, as the Nittany Lions have struggled inside all season, but Bittle also brings shooting capabilities, averaging 33% from beyond the arc in his career.</p>\n                <p>Outside of that, the Ducks have other contributors also able to step up; Kwame Evans Jr. does it all, with double-digit scoring paired with team-high rebounding and a block and steal per game. While the junior forward is streaky from beyond the arc, he still has the most efficient field goal percentage among starters.</p>\n                <p>Picking up those misses from downtown is senior Takai Simpson, the last double-digit scorer on the squad, but he\u2019s seen his own mistakes come back to bite him, as he holds the No. 2 spot in the Big Ten for the most turnovers in a single game at seven.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white is the worst in the conference at rebounding, so the Ducks beat it there. But for two squads that remain almost equal in possession stats, the glass and turnover battles remain essential for getting extra looks.</p>\n                <p>Statistician Evan Miyakawa ranks Oregon as the team with the highest Big Ten pace adjust, meaning the Ducks perform better in games with more possessions and worse in games with fewer.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions appear almost fully healthy in this one, so Mike Rhoades has full tools at his disposal. The lone sidelined, Sasa Ciani, has already been reported as day-to-day, so a return is possible.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>The quarterfinals kicked off in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games in women\u2019s hockey. Penn State forward Nicole Hall and former defenseman Jessica Adolfsson qualified for the quarterfinals with Team Sweden from Group B to take on Czechia out of Group A in the first round.</p>\n                <p>The Swedes held off a late comeback effort from Czechia, advancing to the semifinals with a 2-0 score.</p>\n                <p>Sweden was undefeated in preliminary play and led the second group, while Czechia finished third in Group A, but automatically qualified as a member of the top group.</p>\n                <p>The matchup was about as even as the international rankings showed. Czechia entered the Olympic Games as the No. 4 team in the world, while Sweden was just below at No. 6.</p>\n                <p>However, the Swedes finished the 2022 Olympic Games in eighth place, with an opportunity to improve on that finish.</p>\n                <p>The battle was back-and-forth for most of the first period. Neither team could find the back of the net, with Czechia\u2019s Klara Peslarova shutting down any attempt from Sweden. On the other side, Ebba Svensson Traff was dominant in net, giving the offense an opportunity to thrive.</p>\n                <p>The shots in the first period were knotted at six, with neither team finding offensive momentum. The second period gave the first opportunity to the Swedes. While on a power play, Hanna Olsson found a wide-open net and broke the ice with a man-advantage goal.</p>\n                <p>Olsson\u2019s goal was assisted by Hilda Svensson and Maja Nylen Persson just 4:47 into the second period.</p>\n                <p>Czechia attempted to get the goal back, but four penalties in the middle frame ended any chance before the third period.</p>\n                <p>The third period saw more of the same, with neither team having any momentum. Halfway through the frame, it appeared Sweden doubled its lead. However, the goal was immediately waved off, and in turn was a penalty on the Swedes.</p>\n                <p>It was Czechia\u2019s greatest opportunity, and the unit fired shot after shot at the net. Some of them made it to the net, while a majority were blocked by the penalty-kill unit of the Swedes.</p>\n                <p>Another penalty came just minutes later, but once again, Sweden shut down the power play and maintained its 1-0 lead. After another great set of defensive plays, Svensson found herself fending off the defense with an empty net. The Ohio State product back-handed the puck into the net, giving the Swedes a 2-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>It was all she wrote from there, as Sweden fended off any last effort from Czechia, winning 2-0 and advancing to the semifinals. The Swedes are guaranteed to play for a medal no matter the result of their next game.</p>\n                <p>For the Penn State players, Adolfsson totaled 19:16 of ice time, finishing as a plus-1 on the game. As a fourth-line player, Hall saw minimal action, playing just under four minutes of game time. Despite this, the Nittany Lion duo will have a chance to continue the rise of Swedish women\u2019s hockey in the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Sweden will play the winner of Team USA and Team Italy in the semifinals. No matter the winner, the two Penn Staters will take on a fellow Penn State player, with Tessa Janecke on Team USA and Matilde Fantin on Team Italy.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 1 Penn State will host their biggest dual meet of the season at 7 p.m. on Friday at the Bryce Jordan Center against No. 2 Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>The Big Ten slate comes to a close with a test between two undefeated programs vying for the number one position in the country. While the Nittany Lions hold the talent edge throughout the lineup, the construction of a front-heavy Buckeyes\u2019 squad could put some pressure on Penn State if they come away with some bonus points between 125 and 141 pounds.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how the nation's two best teams stack up.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 2 Nic Bouzakis (OSU)</p>\n                <p>The opening bout will be the most anticipated of the dual. While Intermat ranks Luke Lilledahl No.1, the coaches poll has Bouzakis at the top of the class.</p>\n                <p>Both of these wrestlers have a lot in common, going back to their high school alma mater Wyoming Seminary. They both also have only lost to teammates this season, which do not count as officially NCAA losses.</p>\n                <p>Both wrestlers sit above a 60% bonus rate, with Bouzakis having three pins to his name compared to Lilledahl\u2019s one in 2025-26.</p>\n                <p>Bouzakis will have the strength advantage after dropping down from 133 pounds, but Lilledahl has the speed to counter that. The match will be fast paced as both are known for coming out of the gate hot in big matches.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 2 Ben Davino (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze and Ben Davino are very familiar with each other entering this top-five clash. These two have wrestled five times since 2016, with Blaze taking the three most recent matches. To add to the drama, Davino is the last wrestler to have defeated Blaze in folkstyle wrestling back in 2023.</p>\n                <p>Both men enter the bout undefeated. Blaze has more impressive numbers on the season, with an 88% bonus rate, while Davino has an extra year of college experience under his belt. This is the biggest coin flip of the dual.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 12 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 1 Jesse Mendez (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Jesse Mendez is the defending national champion and has been a machine at 141 pounds, making a deep weight class look shallow by scoring bonus points in 15 of his 17 bouts.</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis\u2019 style this season of being overly aggressive cost him in his bout against Nebraska\u2019s Brock Hardy, resulting in a pin and a misconduct point deduction for Penn State. Coming off of a skin issue, per Cael Sanderson, Davis will have to rethink his strategy to avoid gassing out against Mendez and not allow him to steal some extra points for the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 6 Ethan Stiles (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness pinned Ethan Stiles in the consolation semifinals of last season\u2019s NCAA National Championships. Since then, Van Ness hasn\u2019t lost a match.</p>\n                <p>For Stiles, his highest-ranked opponent on the season, Cornell\u2019s Jaxon Joy, pinned him. Stiles has shown a unique ground style that may slow down Van Ness\u2019 rapid scoring, but he is unlikely to secure many points against the Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 4 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Landon Desselle (OSU)</p>\n                <p>The 157-pound matchup was expected to be a top-five bout, but with No. 1 Brandon Cannon out with injury, PJ Duke gets an easier night inside the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Desselle is 6-5 on the year and hasn\u2019t shown any indication that he could challenge Duke on the big stage. This match is a bonus-point opportunity for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 16 Paddy Gallagher (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Countering Mendez for the Nittany Lions is their tech-fall machine Mitchell Mesenbrink.</p>\n                <p>Last season, Paddy Gallagher was scheduled to face Mesenbrink in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament. However, he injury defaulted before continuing through the consolation bracket.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink has scored bonus points for Penn State in all 17 matches he has competed in this season. With Gallagher previously falling to Iowa\u2019s Michael Caliendo during a rockier season, there is no indication that Mesenbrink\u2019s streak is at risk of falling on Friday.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 5 Carson Kharchla (OSU)</p>\n                <p>At 174 pounds, it sees an interesting style matchup between Levi Haines and Carson Kharchla. Watching these two compete separately, they both run a similar style on the mat.</p>\n                <p>Haines has only had three matches this season end in a decision, while Kharchla lacks momentum after a loss to Iowa\u2019s Patrick Kennedy.</p>\n                <p>Haines defeated Kharchla 6-4 last season, but Kharchla secured the first takedown. The nature of the similar styles and slower pace in these bigger matchups means this will likely be a close, low-scoring affair.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 8 Dylan Fishback (OSU)</p>\n                <p>This bout will have Rocco Welsh see his old team, as he left the Buckeyes to come to Happy Valley over the offseason. Since leaving Columbus, Welsh\u2019s bet on himself has paid off. He rose to be the No. 1 wrestler in the 184-pound weight class.</p>\n                <p>Dylan Fishback came to the Buckeyes from NC State after Welsh\u2019s departure and has been a steady hand in the scarlett and gray\u2019s lineup. He has four losses on the year, but three of them occurred in sudden victory. It is unlikely he\u2019ll let Welsh drag him down easily. Expect a close decision at 184.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 10 Luke Geog (OSU)</p>\n                <p>On paper, this looks like an easy win for Josh Barr, but Luke Geog has been on a recent tear with three straight major decisions entering the Bryce Jordan Center. However, Geog\u2019s track record of losses places him in a tier below the top of 197 pounds.</p>\n                <p>Barr is the top of the weight class, with a 100% bonus rate since returning from injury. This bout will be an opportunity for Penn State to shut down the Buckeyes\u2019 chances of pulling off the major upset.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. No. 3 Nick Feldman (OSU)</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola has had multiple chances to face the upper class and larger wrestlers in the heavyweight division, from Iowa\u2019s Ben Kueter to Nebraska\u2019s AJ Ferrari. Friday he gets another opportunity against Nick Feldman.</p>\n                <p>Feldman has two signature wins over Ferrari this season after entering the campaign as a national title contender. The Buckeye also defeated Mirasola 10-3 in a matchup last season. This bout should be closer with more matches under Mirasola\u2019s belt and should be as boring of a heavyweight match as can be expected in the Big Ten with the aggressive styles both men carry.</p>\n                <p>If the dual somehow comes down to the heavyweight bout, Penn State fans will be sweating this matchup closing the meet.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Brennan Kramp I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Whether it\u2019s a suit and tie, a cardigan or a band T-shirt, you never know what kind of outfit you\u2019ll get from your professor on any given day. Sometimes professors dress for authority, sometimes for comfort and other times to send a message. At Penn State, there\u2019s no one specific philosophy on styling up for a lecture, but there are certainly fitting points.</p>\n                <p>Patrick Higgins, a finance professor, said he wants to express his level of effort and work ethic through the clothing he wears.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA casual dress code can create a casual culture and could introduce some sloppiness,\u201d Higgins, a finance professor at Smeal, said. \u201cI take my job seriously, and I\u2019m communicating that by the way I dress.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Jan Reimann, a mathematics professor, has a much more laid back approach to his outfit choices, and said keeping it casual makes things go a little bit smoother between the student-teacher relationship.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m a person of authority by position, but I want [the students] to feel like I take this seriously, but I don\u2019t want them to be intimidated,\u201d Reimann, an associate math professor said. \u201cI don\u2019t try to dress up for classes \u2026 but, for example, I would not wear shorts and flip-flops to class.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Now, not everyone has to be in a classroom to attend class. Penn State\u2019s World Campus has the second highest attendance rate among all other campuses, just behind University Park. However, this does mean the parameters on dress codes is quite a gray area.</p>\n                <p>World Campus Professor Joshua Winskowski said his previous experience teaching high school in China helped him define his professional attire going into his first year as a collegiate professor.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMost of the other teachers over there didn\u2019t do that, they just dressed more casually,\u201d Winskowski, a professor of world literature, said. \u201cI found that presenting myself in a very formal way \u2026 could allow me to be relaxed and joke around and be playful, but people would still take me seriously.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said getting the feel of the classroom and the students can be a great indicator of how to either dress up or down.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf I thought it would help facilitate the class, I would dress more formally,\u201d Winskowski said. \u201cAnd if I thought dressing more casually would facilitate a better class, I would do that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While dress can sometimes have an effect, oftentimes it means very little to students. One professor can wear a pressed shirt and a bowtie without ever harvesting an intellectual environment and another can show up in jeans and a sweater pulled from the bottom set of a hand-me-down box their mom found and have every single eye locked on them.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I teach my first class, I\u2019ll probably go in with a button up and the tie, get the feel of the room and then I\u2019ll decide whether I want to keep doing that or whether we can just chill,\u201d Winskowski said. \u201cIf no one\u2019s paying any attention to what I\u2019m wearing, then I\u2019m not going to waste my time worrying about it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTET</p>",

    "author": "Skylar Williamson I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Every year, a new reality TV show takes over social media feeds and group chats. People start to create parasocial bonds with characters, live through their lives and sit on the edges of their seats each week while waiting for a new episode.</p>\n                <p>While scripted dramas and comedies cycle in and out of popularity, competition-based reality shows continue to draw loyal audiences season after season.</p>\n                <p>Reality game shows grew in popularity during the early 2000s with programs like \u201cBig Brother,\u201d a competition show where houseguests are put into a secluded, monitored house and participate in different games to avoid elimination, with one person winning the entire show.</p>\n                <p>Whether it\u2019s cooking, fashion, dancing or love-based, reality game shows are framed around competition, elimination and prizes mixed with drama and suspense, unlike traditional reality shows, which are completely based on drama.</p>\n                <p>According to Matthew Jordan, reality TV has sustained popularity for a long time due to a few different reasons.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey are cheap to produce, so they require little money for writers and actors,\u201d Jordan, the Department head of Film Production and Media Studies, said. \u201cThey also tend to cast characters who are sensational or outrageous, so they attract people who enjoy watching train wrecks.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In film production, budget is the most important aspect of creating new shows, so there is a lot more investment being put into reality television as a genre of film. Networks and streamers like Peacock are trying to find cost-effective ways to expand their libraries.</p>\n                <p>Cory Baker, who teaches a class on reality television this semester, said reality TV has been a positive solution to budgeting issues \u2014 especially for streaming services \u2014 over the last 40 years in American TV.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe streamers in particular spent so much money trying to build out scripted franchises when launching their platforms between 2019 and 2021, and there\u2019s some spender\u2019s remorse there,\u201d Baker, an assistant professor in media studies, said. \u201cI think the executives look at the success of library titles like \u2018Survivor\u2019 on Paramount+, or the growth of \u2018Love island\u2019 across multiple platforms, and realize audiences still love reality TV from wherever they\u2019re accessing it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Jordan said the idea of a reality show being a competition attracts viewers itself, with the \u201cvote off\u201d format many adopt helping to create a sense of suspense week to week for the audience.</p>\n                <p>Danielle DiLorenzo said all summer, she waited for the new episode of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d to air every night.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe fact that it came on most weeknights in the summer gave me something to look forward to, and I don\u2019t think I ever missed an episode,\u201d DiLorenzo, a first-year studying finance, said. \u201cAfter every episode, I made predictions about what was going to happen the day next and repeated this cycle all the time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The big question of reality television as a whole is what is real, and what isn\u2019t. The unknown is often another reason why viewers are infatuated with the genre, but also why they might hate it.</p>\n                <p>Baker and Jordan both said creating a live show using \u201creal\u201d people, rather than completely scripted actors, gives audiences a connection to the show.</p>\n                <p>\u201cContemporary audiences know that they\u2019re not seeing a one-to-one replication of what happened on the island or in the house because the show has been shaped and produced by hundreds of people,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a real pleasure in navigating that continuum of reality.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Baker also said each show is different, and sometimes the less \u201creal\u201d and more outrageous a show is, the better. In other contexts, the more a show feels like a documentary might be better for other audiences.</p>\n                <p>Angeline Korompis said one appealing trait of reality game shows is that they\u2019re fun to watch.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pure entertainment,\u201d Korompis, a first-year studying marketing, said. \u201cI like when a show is so insane that I can\u2019t take my eyes off of the screen, even if I know it\u2019s not completely real.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With the help of social media platforms, like TikTok, reality game shows will remain popular with younger generations. The blend of strategy, suspense, social psychology \u2014 and a couple attractive contestants \u2014 is the perfect mix for people\u2019s pleasure.</p>\n                <p>Even as television evolves, the basic appeal of competition remains constant. As long as audiences enjoy watching the drama of it all, reality game shows will continue to dominate the screens.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey\u2019re always popular with millions of people because they offer a great mix of predictability and unpredictability,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAll it takes is one really great game structure or a couple of great casting decisions for a reality TV series to take audiences by storm.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Veronica Figg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Bill Pickle\u2019s Tap Room finally released their highly anticipated burgers. The bar at 106 S Allen St announced the news last week on their Instagram.</p>\n                <p>I was excited to try them out, along with a few other new menu items that they had debuted. I started off with some of the new appetizers: Bill's Fried Pickles and Saucy Tenders.</p>\n                <p>Bill\u2019s Fried Pickles</p>\n                <p>The fried pickles were a new addition to their daytime menu. They were fried in a crispy batter and served with their house made \u201cJawn Jawn\u201d sauce. To my delight, the sauce was dairy-free.</p>\n                <p>The highlight of this dish for me wasn\u2019t the entree, but the sauce. It was creamy with just the right amount of tang.</p>\n                <p>The breading unfortunately overpowered the pickles due to their usually strong taste being subdued by the doughy breading which was greasy, but thankfully not enough to be soggy. However, the sauce brought enough flavor to the dish for me to enjoy it.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 5/10</p>\n                <p>Chicken Tenders with Sweet and Spicy Thai Sauce</p>\n                <p>I love chicken tenders, but this dish was not it. The sauce was a nice blend, being sweet with an aftertaste of sharp heat, but it overwhelmed the chicken to where I couldn\u2019t taste it at all.</p>\n                <p>The breading was crunchy, but too thick. When paired with the sauce, it made the chicken underneath disappear, and made for an unpleasant eating experience.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 3/10</p>\n                <p>The Billy G.O.A.T</p>\n                <p>The highly-anticipated burgers did not disappoint. I believe there are no words to describe how good The Billy G.O.A.T burger was, but as your food reporter I must try.</p>\n                <p>The Billy G.O.A.T burger comes with two beef smash patties, caramelized onions, smoked gouda, \u201cJawn Jawn\u201d sauce, lettuce and tomato, although I removed the gouda from my burger.</p>\n                <p>I felt like this burger perfectly describes the word umami \u2014 a savory taste that stays with you long after your last bite. This burger was so juicy and not greasy at all, and the \u201cJawn Jawn\u201d sauce elevated this dish immensely.</p>\n                <p>The sauce had a spicy kick that hadn\u2019t come out as much with the fried pickles, but paired well with the crunchy lettuce that added a needed texture to the soft burger. The tomato was refreshing on the burger patties, and while I couldn\u2019t taste the caramelized onions, it was still delicious.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 10/10</p>\n                <p>The Bucking Burger</p>\n                <p>Bill Pickle\u2019s Tap Room is known for their BBQ and they definitely deliver with this burger. The Bucking Burger comes with one BBQ smash patty, pulled pork shoulder, pepper jack, caramelized onions, spicy BBQ, onion straws and jalape\u00f1os. I removed the pepper jack on top, and they placed the jalape\u00f1os on the side.</p>\n                <p>They know how to make the perfect pulled pork, as it was juicy and just the perfect amount of spicy with the BBQ sauce. The patty and pulled pork made for an umami moment, with the juiciness of both creating a great savory flavor combination.</p>\n                <p>The onion straws were crispy and added a crunch to the juiciness of the burger. Unlike the previous burger, you can taste the caramelized onions that were crunchy and sweet. This burger was just as delicious, and I would recommend either for a night out with friends.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 10/10</p>\n                <p>Strawberry Lemonade</p>\n                <p>All those burgers made me thirsty, so I ordered a strawberry lemonade to try. I knew this drink was superior because I don\u2019t even really like lemonade, and I ordered two glasses of it.</p>\n                <p>I loved this drink \u2014 it was sweet and had a strong lemon flavor, which is par for the course with lemonade. The strawberry blended well, creating a drink that was so good I got a refill.</p>\n                <p>Rating:10/10</p>\n                <p>Veronica\u2019s Food Sensitivity Corner</p>\n                <p>As a student who was recently diagnosed with a dairy sensitivity, I\u2019m always on the lookout for foods that fit my new dietary needs. I\u2019m also aware there are other students who may have similar needs as well.</p>\n                <p>All of Bill Pickle\u2019s Tap Room\u2019s smoked meats and table side sauces are gluten free. They also have gluten free buns, corn tortillas and wraps, along with a vegetarian menu which features the Birria Fried Plantain Tacos.</p>\n                <p>Birria Fried Plantain Tacos</p>\n                <p>These tacos were incredible, and came with fried plantain, al pastor seasoned sauteed onion/peppers/pineapple, pickled red onion and lime crema served with a side of vegan consume. With my order, I removed the lime crema.</p>\n                <p>The sweet plantains and crispy onions mixed together in a wonderful sweet and crunchy flavor combination, and the flour tortillas were crispy with a great crunch. There was a little bit of a kick, but the sweetness of the plantains made for a well balanced sweet and spicy bite. You can\u2019t taste the pineapple or peppers as much, but I loved every bite.</p>\n                <p>Rating:10/10</p>\n                <p>Final Thoughts</p>\n                <p>I will definitely be returning to Bill Pickle\u2019s Tap Room the next time my family comes to town, so they can experience the wonderful burgers themselves.</p>\n                <p>Bill Pickle\u2019s Tap Room is open Tuesday to Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to midnight or later and Mondays from 4 p.m. to midnight or later.

    "description": "<p>Following a heartbreaking loss to No. 14 Villanova in Holuba Hall, Penn State will have a chance to bounce back on the road against Princeton on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The No. 15 Nittany Lions suffered a 14-13 overtime loss to the Wildcats last weekend despite leading by a pair of goals late in the fourth quarter. Performances from midfielder Nick Lucchesi and attackman Colin Michener fueled the Villanova upset, combining for seven points in the matchup.</p>\n                <p>Despite losing to the Wildcats for the first time since 2023, several Nittany Lions delivered strong performances. Hunter Aquino and Chase Robertson scored hat tricks, and freshman attackman Jack Iannantuono put up four points to tie Aquino for the team lead.</p>\n                <p>Saturday will mark the blue and white\u2019s third consecutive season to feature a matchup with the No. 3 Tigers, with last year\u2019s result paralleling its defeat to Villanova. Princeton beat the Nittany Lions 11-10 in another overtime loss that was played inside Holuba Hall.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers are yet to take the field in 2026, as Saturday\u2019s meeting with Penn State will serve as both their season and home opener.</p>\n                <p>Princeton went 13-4 last season, compiling a 5-1 record in the Ivy League. Its only losses in conference play came to eventual national champion Cornell, which beat the Tigers in both the regular season and the Ivy League tournament.</p>\n                <p>After beating Towson 22-12 in the opening round, the Tigers\u2019 2025 campaign came to an end in the NCAA Quarterfinals with a 19-18 loss to Syracuse.</p>\n                <p>This season, they\u2019ve been voted as the favorite to take the Ivy League title, claiming 12 of the 14 possible Ivy League first-place votes.</p>\n                <p>Two Princeton seniors, attackman Chad Palumbo and goaltender Ryan Croddick, were named to the Tewaaraton Preseason Watchlist, with the former being selected as a preseason first-team All-American by Inside Lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>In addition to the already-named Palumbo, attackman Nate Kabiri should be a tough matchup for the Penn State defensive unit. The junior recorded 61 points and a team-high 29 assists in 2025, and is primed to improve those numbers with the departure of Princeton's all-time leading goalscorer, Coulter Mackesy.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers lead the all-time series with the Nittany Lions, holding a 4-1 record that dates back 35 years. Penn State\u2019s lone win against Princeton came in 2023, a 13-12 victory in which TJ Malone put up a team-leading six points and midfielder Ethan Long scored five goals.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Annie Gleba | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 16 Penn State returns home to Rec Hall at 2 p.m. Saturday for a Big Ten matchup with No. 15 Minnesota for the Nittany Lions\u2019 Senior Day. This meet follows the blue and white's narrow loss to No. 11 Michigan State, 197.125-196.725.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is now 4-2 overall with a 3-1 conference record. There are two Big Ten meets remaining before the start of the tournaments. This makes Saturday\u2019s contest an important opportunity to keep developing the Nittany Lions\u2019 strength and scores.</p>\n                <p>Now, Penn State will have to lean on some of its more experienced upperclassmen to restart its momentum and finish out conference play on a high note. Senior leaders will be important in matches within stronger categories of both teams, like floor.</p>\n                <p>One of the Nittany Lions\u2019 consistent top scorers is Dani Latronica. Some of the sophomores\u2019 highest scores were a 9.9500 on the bars and a 9.9250 on the beam. She\u2019ll be a key contributor on Saturday in keeping those categories strong for Penn State, particularly on the bars, where cleaner landings could create a separation in the scoring.</p>\n                <p>On vault, Ava Piedrahita held the top score on her team with a 9.9250. The senior brings experience that will be critical in an event that has been Penn State's lowest-scoring rotation this season.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State, the strongest performances have come on the balance beam and floor. Beam has been a stable score for the Nittany Lions, while the floor has shown strong performances. There will need to be improvements to the vault for the blue and white to achieve a higher overall score than Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota is coming into this matchup just above Penn State, being ranked No.15. They sit with a record of 4-3 overall, being split in conference play at 2-2. They have key wins over top programs, such as No. 8 Arkansas and No. 9 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Like Penn State, one of the Golden Gophers' best events is floor, making for tight competition. However, the Nittany Lions need to improve in the bars and beam events, creating potential scoring opportunities for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>An athlete to watch out for in Minnesota is Jordyn Lyden. The junior holds two top scores for her team, earning a 9.9250 on the bar and a 9.9500 on a floor routine. Lyden\u2019s ability to deliver a high-performing floor routine could be a major threat to the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>With both teams having similar strengths and weaknesses and the ranking difference of just one, the Senior Day meet could be one of the closest scores we\u2019ve seen this season, potentially decided within a few tenths, allowing for very few flaws in the routines.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

Right off the bat, Roban elevated his game and made himself one of the best runners in the nation.</p>\n                <p>In just his second collegiate race, Roban earned his first victory in the 600 meters with a 1:16.91. A week later, he won his first 800m in 1:47.01 at the Sykes &amp; Sabock Invitational.</p>\n                <p>As the postseason rolled around, Roban earned a silver medal in the 800m at the Big Ten championship before finishing third at the NCAA Indoor championship. That success was echoed in the outdoor season, as he earned another bronze medal at the NCAA championship while setting the No. 4 time in school history.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTalent-wise, he\u2019s world-class,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known that for a long time, since I started coaching him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Entering his second season with the blue and white, Roban had high expectations following his flashy freshman year. With the help of his coaches, he started right where he left off with similar times in the 600m and 800m.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt shows that he\u2019s bought into what coach Foster is trying to do here with that event group,\u201d head coach John Gondak told the Collegian. \u201cHe\u2019s putting in the time and the effort.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Roban didn\u2019t medal at either the indoor or outdoor NCAA championships in his sophomore season, he secured podium finishes at the conference championships, setting the No. 2 mark in the indoor 800m and the No. 3 mark in the outdoor 800m.</p>\n                <p>However, Roban\u2019s biggest accomplishment in 2024 came when he represented his country, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, at the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pride and joy because my country is pretty small,\u201d Roban said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me making a name for myself and putting my country out there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Roban ultimately fell just short of an Olympic semifinals appearance in the 800m, but became the first Nittany Lion in school history to represent Penn State in the Olympic 800m.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think to see someone have the success that he\u2019s having and is from where you\u2019re from, I think it really opens the doors for young people to see what\u2019s possible,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI know he\u2019s super proud of who he is and where he\u2019s from.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Roban entered his junior year, things didn\u2019t go as planned during the indoor season. The 2024 Olympian missed the entirety of the 2025 indoor season due to an injury, but returned for the outdoor schedule.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI trust the program so much that I could get back in two weeks no matter how much time I miss,\u201d Roban said. \u201cIf I got two weeks or more, that\u2019s enough time to run fast.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After setting a personal best in the 1500 meters and a near personal best in the 400 meters to kick off the 2025 outdoor season, Roban climbed the ranks in the record book once again.</p>\n                <p>Roban set the No. 2 time in Penn State history at the 2025 Florida Relays as he ran 1:45.26 for second in the event.</p>\n                <p>Insert art: Penn State track and field, Roban relay</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe wants to make this a professional career for him,\u201d Gondak said. \u201cHe\u2019s putting himself in a great position to do that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Roban\u2019s outdoor season didn\u2019t live up to the hype with a first-round exit in the NCAA championship, his best time of his career came soon that summer.</p>\n                <p>On Aug. 18, Roban ran the second-fastest 800m in NCAA history at the NACAC Championships in the Bahamas, recording a time of 1:42.87 while representing his home country.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe coaches here are so supportive,\u201d Roban said. \u201cThey encourage you to compete outside the NCAA, if it\u2019s making a national team or representing their country. They will help as much as possible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Coming off his record-setting race, Roban joined an elite group of mid-distance runners at Penn State and continued to let his dominance shine.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s really becoming much more from where he was as a freshman,\u201d Gondak said. \u201cNow he\u2019s becoming a great leader on the team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In the team\u2019s first home meet of the season, the mid-distance squad recorded four of the top-10 1,000-meter performances in NCAA history. After months of practice with the elite squad, Roban finished second in the race to set the No. 8 all-time mark in NCAA history in 2:18.72.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEver since we have gotten closer, it\u2019s not even like a squad anymore,\u201d Roban said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like brotherhood for us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With half the indoor season still to come and Roban\u2019s final outdoor season on the horizon, the senior star has a lot on his mind in his last dance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFor me, my main goal has always been running faster than I did and being one of the best in the world,\u201d Roban said. \u201cRight now, I think I\u2019m pretty close to that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE TRACK AND FIELD COVERAGE</p>",

In 2024, Penn State won 22-8 in the season opener, with 11 different athletes scoring, including six goals from Nittany Lion legend Kristin O\u2019Neill.</p>\n                <p>Bucknell has only hosted 10 of the 22 contests in its season history, but even on home turf has come away unsuccessful.</p>\n                <p>In program history, the Nittany Lions have dominated with only one shutout in 1979.

Against Youngstown State, she scored three goals and recorded five assists, tallying a team-high eight points.</p>\n                <p>While the Penguins had no answer for Bucknell\u2019s attack, junior Bella Crowley stood out in net for the Bison.</p>\n                <p>The Ridgefield, Connecticut, native recorded eight saves compared to six goals scored, posting a 57.1% save percentage.</p>\n                <p>The Bison have their home opener on Friday against UMBC before traveling to Happy Valley for Sunday\u2019s contest.</p>\n                <p>Sunday\u2019s matchup</p>\n                <p>Both teams appear to be high-scoring squads this season, making Sunday\u2019s matchup an offensive showcase.</p>\n                <p>While they\u2019ve only played one game, Bucknell scored 20 goals this season.

    "author": "Lexi Cannan | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Valentine\u2019s Day feels unavoidable once February hits. One minute it\u2019s a normal week.; the next, everything is red, pink and overly romantic.</p>\n                <p>It happens fast. Couples take over your feed, restaurants fill up and someone asks about your Valentine\u2019s Day plans. It feels like you missed a group chat you were never added to. At that point, closing Instagram feels like the right choice.</p>\n                <p>If you\u2019re single, the move is simple. Stay in and do your own thing. No pressure to make plans or pretend you care more than you do. Put on something you\u2019ll actually enjoy and let it just be another night.</p>\n                <p>Here are some movie picks if you\u2019re single on Valentine\u2019s Day and keeping it low-key.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLegally Blonde\u201d</p>\n                <p>This is not a love story. This is a confidence story. Elle Woods gets dumped and immediately decides to level up instead of spiraling. She goes to law school, proves everyone wrong and somehow stays positive the whole time.</p>\n                <p>Watching \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d when you\u2019re single actually feels good. Elle doesn\u2019t sit around waiting for someone else to change their mind. She focuses on herself, figures things out and keeps moving forward. That mindset hits when everyone else seems ahead.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s funny, comforting and weirdly makes you believe in yourself. It reminds you that getting dumped is not a personality trait and being single is not a failure, which is exactly what you want on Valentine\u2019s Day.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBridesmaids\u201d</p>\n                <p>This movie is about having your life kind of fall apart. \u201cBridesmaids\u201d feels very real. Everyone is stressed, insecure and trying to keep it together. That reminder alone makes the movie worth watching.</p>\n                <p>It makes being single feel way more normal. No one in this movie has anything figured out, and that\u2019s honestly reassuring.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s loud, awkward and chaotic in the best way. At the very least, it reminds you that things could always be worse \u2014 and that sometimes, laughing at the mess is the healthiest option.</p>\n                <p>\u201c10 Things I Hate About You\u201d</p>\n                <p>This one works if you don\u2019t mind a rom-com and want something easy and funny. \u201c10 Things I Hate About You\u201d doesn\u2019t revolve around chasing love.</p>\n                <p>Main character Kat Stratford is sarcastic, independent and very clear about not changing herself for anyone. The romance is there, but it\u2019s not the whole point. The movie focuses more on confidence and independence.</p>\n                <p>Watching it single doesn\u2019t feel annoying or sad. The humor carries the movie, and the characters don\u2019t act like being in a relationship is the only thing that matters. Kat doing her own thing is honestly the best part, and it\u2019s an easy and familiar watch.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAnyone But You\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cAnyone But You\u201d is a great pick if you want something popular and don\u2019t feel like thinking too much. You can scroll, snack, miss scenes and still not be confused. Easily one of the better rom-coms being released lately.</p>\n                <p>Every scene is hilarious in its own way. You\u2019re not watching for it to be realistic, you\u2019re just watching to laugh and stay distracted.</p>\n                <p>Bea and Ben, played by Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney respectively, are dramatic, stubborn and always doing the most. Watching their mess makes being single on Valentine\u2019s Day pretty peaceful.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCrazy, Stupid, Love\u201d</p>\n                <p>A comfort choice if you\u2019ve ever watched your friends give terrible relationship advice. It\u2019ll make your dating life feel less embarrassing. Everyone in the film thinks they know what they\u2019re doing until they don\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>The story jumps between relationships, which keeps it interesting. Each storyline brings its own awkward moments and bad decisions that keeps things moving. By the end, all the different threads come together in a silly but satisfying way. It\u2019s perfect if you want reassurance that you\u2019re doing just fine.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\u201d</p>\n                <p>The whole movie is basically two people lying their way into the worst relationship possible.</p>\n                <p>Journalist Andie is doing everything wrong on purpose to scare advertising executive Ben away. Ben stays because he\u2019s committed to winning a bet with coworkers over the chance to represent a lucrative account. Neither of them can quit, which makes every date more ridiculous than the last.</p>\n                <p>The chaos just keeps getting worse. There\u2019s clingy behavior, dramatic fights and fake vulnerability, while both of them think they\u2019re winning the whole time.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s funny because both of them fully commit to the mess and makes being single feel like the better option.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "title": "\u2018I\u2019m really privileged to be here\u2019 | DL coach Ikaika Malloe embracing new life at Penn State",
    "author": "Lexie Linderman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>There\u2019s plenty about Ikaika Malloe that\u2019s unorthodox.</p>\n                <p>For starters, he\u2019s a Hawaiian living in State College, and he posts \u201cHappy Aloha Friday\u201d on X each week. His name means \u201cwarrior,\u201d and his coaching style focuses on beating offensive linemen at their own game.</p>\n                <p>Malloe is unlike any defensive line coach Penn State has had. Growing up in Oahu, Hawaii, and playing college football at Washington, he\u2019s only lived on the East Coast once, so he\u2019s just now learning about and realizing the national reach his new program has.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn my mind, I was like, I'm hoping to just get a couple guys from the West Coast. And as I'm flying (out west), people are calling me like, \u2018Make sure you stop by our school. We got a guy.\u2019 ,\u201d Malloe said Feb. 4. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, your guy\u2019s committed.\u2019 (They said) \u2018I know, but he's not at Penn State.\u2019 So the power of Penn State goes nationally, and I didn't have that respect for it at the time, and now I do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Malloe joined the Nittany Lions after four seasons at UCLA, serving as defensive coordinator the last two. He left the Bruins after their 0-3 start to 2025, openly admitting he felt the blame for the poor beginning should fall on him instead of DeShaun Foster, who was fired three days before his departure.</p>\n                <p>But 105 days after he and UCLA parted ways, Malloe still didn\u2019t have a job. His former employer, D\u2019Anton Lynn, wanted to change that. Three days after Lynn was hired to be Penn State\u2019s defensive coordinator, he called Malloe to once again be his defensive line coach.</p>\n                <p>Lynn and Malloe only worked together for one season at UCLA in 2023, but the impression Lynn made stuck with Malloe at the time, and he was one of two key reasons the Hawaiian decided to make the cross country move.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI had so much respect for him because of how young he was, and he was put in a role to lead, and he actually went the other way to follow,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cHe's very humble. He walks behind the scenes. He doesn't take credit for anything. And his whole concept is, \u2018can I find something to fit you?\u2019 As opposed to, \u2018I got to go find all these guys to fit me.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>Further, Malloe felt Penn State was the right place for him because of Matt Campbell. Malloe immediately fell in love with Campbell\u2019s message and coaching style, as it reminded him of his former boss Chris Petersen.</p>\n                <p>Petersen was the head coach at Washington for six seasons. Malloe worked under the College Football Hall of Famer as his defensive line coach for four of those years and took plenty of lessons with him, such as to embody integrity in every aspect of coaching.</p>\n                <p>But quite possibly the biggest thing Malloe learned from working with Petersen was how to build relationships with his players.</p>\n                <p>Indianapolis Colt Laiatu Latu has said on multiple occasions that he views Malloe as a father figure, following him from Washington to UCLA after the Huskies forced him to medically retire.</p>\n                <p>A few of Malloe\u2019s other former players have expressed similar sentiments \u2014 although maybe not to the degree of Latu. It\u2019s something he prides himself on, and it\u2019s a promise he makes to each player he coaches.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you come here to Penn State, that's one thing for sure you will have is, I'm going to give you everything I've got,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cI want to make sure that you as a parent will respect that. I'm going to try to treat your son just like that's my own.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Malloe is still settling into his new life in Happy Valley, but the one thing that will never change for Malloe is who he is and how he coaches. Penn State is already getting a taste of that.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is one of the elite, elite schools, and I'm really privileged to be here,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Student Farm Club (SFC)\u2019s food justice project team held its second annual food justice summit on Thursday in the HUB-Robeson Center.</p>\n                <p>Matthew Koah said he hoped the summit would introduce attendees to what food justice is and provide them with the pathways that would allow them to get involved.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI want (students) to be able to work together and use their voices to come up with changes they want to see at the university and the community,\u201d Koah, a fourth-year studying plant science, said. \u201cI want them to work together to think about how they can implement the changes that they think that they need and I think even going beyond brainstorming and planning behind how we can create change at the university.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The summit saw Penn State Executive Vice President and Provost Fotis Sotiropoulos address attendees as a keynote speaker.</p>\n                <p>In an interview, Sotiropoulos said he saw food insecurity as an obstacle to student success at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>He said he hoped attendees left the summit feeling energized with new ideas about how they can advance food justice.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAt every opportunity, we have to introduce our students to these bigger issues and make it very clear how they can play a big role in being the change that we need everybody to drive forward,\u201d Sotiropoulos said. \u201cEvents like this make a difference in that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Following Sotiropoulos's speech, a panel of student leaders took to the stage which included Student Farm Executive Director Annie Stasney, Students United Against Poverty President Jeremy Lynn and Food Recovery Network President Emmanuel Kraft.</p>\n                <p>Sarah Landauer, a community outreach specialist with the Sustainable Food Systems Network (SFSN), which includes the SFC, said it was important to include figures like Sotiropoulos as a way to show that there is support for food justice within Penn State\u2019s administration.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAs students, we can obviously have a voice in this movement, but when we get that buy-in from higher-level administration, it pushes it through university policy and more people are going to come and listen to us,\u201d Landauer said.</p>\n                <p>She said the inclusion of student leaders was also a way to allow for students to voice their visions for change in their community.</p>\n                <p>The summit concluded with a group brainstorming session and workshops led by several Penn State and State College organizations.</p>\n                <p>Raymond Yan, who also attended last year\u2019s summit, said he believed the SFSN had brought in the right stakeholders from both Penn State and the Pennsylvania state government who are able to best make a difference in combating food insecurity.</p>\n                <p>He said the summit is a good way for students to begin getting involved in advocating for food justice.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you're someone who's working on anything related to food insecurity or hunger, this is the place that you have to be,\u201d Yan, a fourth-year studying agricultural and biorenewable systems management, said. \u201cThese issues are relevant to all students, no matter if you're just coming in or are about to graduate because, even after you graduate, these issues are gonna continue.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>The last time Penn State hit the floor, it fell 81-70 to No. 13 Michigan State, but led for the majority of the game. The Lady Lions got another chance against a ranked opponent, hitting the road for a Thursday night matchup against No. 20 Maryland.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions couldn\u2019t build off a strong first half, falling to the Terps 81-62.</p>\n                <p>Maryland wasted no time, winning the jump and going on an 8-0 run to start the game. Penn State broke the run with two points from Gracie Merkle immediately after she came off the bench.</p>\n                <p>After two minutes with no points from either side, freshman T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante drove through three Terrapins to get the layup from the left side.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions' run continued with a three-pointer from freshman Nyla McFadden to cut Maryland\u2019s lead to one.</p>\n                <p>The Terps held onto their lead thanks to back-to-back two-pointers from Mir McLean outweighed a layup from Merkle.</p>\n                <p>Maryland took a 14-9 lead with just over three minutes to play in the first quarter, but five straight points from sophomore guard Kiyomi McMiller tied the score.</p>\n                <p>McLean hit another two for her sixth points of the quarter, but was matched by an and-one from Merkle on the other end. The 6-foot-6 center hit her foul shot, giving Penn State its first lead of the game and a 17-16 advantage at the end of the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>The second quarter scoring started quickly, with both teams combining for six points in the first minute.</p>\n                <p>Five straight points from McMiller were outmatched by six straight from the Terps\u2019 Oluchi Okananwa, giving Maryland a 26-24 lead with six minutes to play in the half.</p>\n                <p>Okananwa netted her eighth points of the quarter to give the Terps a 30-26 lead, but back-to-back buckets by Cl\u00e8ante and McMiller tied the game for the fifth time of the night.</p>\n                <p>Merkle joined the party with two straight layups, extending Penn State\u2019s run to 8-0 while also giving the Lady Lions their largest lead of the night.</p>\n                <p>Maryland ended the second quarter on an 8-0 run of its own to take a 38-34 lead into the locker room.</p>\n                <p>McMiller and Merkle combined for 23 of the blue and white\u2019s first-half points.

    "author": "The Daily Collegian Baseball Staff",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s February, and the baseball season is upon us. While the MLB\u2019s Spring Training is set to begin in just a few weeks, Penn State baseball\u2019s start is under two days away.</p>\n                <p>After losing five starters to the MLB Draft, the Nittany Lions will seek a chance to follow up past success with fresh faces. The satisfactory 33-23 output last season is behind Mike Gambino and the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>With the turnover and the new season, how likely is Penn State to replicate or surpass its previous record?</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s our staff\u2019s picks.</p>\n                <p>Dominic Megats: 33-22</p>\n                <p>This season will speak volumes on how well Gambino can scout, recruit and utilize the transfer portal to fill voids that were left by departing players. With 13 freshmen and several additions from the portal, solidified depth can carry Penn State a long way.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions begin their season in Arizona for the MLB Desert Invitational. This is where I believe Gambino will test players at different positions and see his pitchers in live games. By the end of the weekend, the skipper will have his lineup and rotation figured out. However, I think Penn State loses a game due to its learning curve.</p>\n                <p>From there, the blue and white will have several non-conference matchups under its belt. One that will pose the greatest challenge to Penn State will be Texas Tech. I think the Red Raiders will get the best of the Nittany Lions in two out of the three games in that series.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will have a favorable record heading into conference play once the middle of March rolls around. Iowa and Oregon pose some threats in Big Ten play. Both teams finished in the top three of the conference last season and ranked top five in offense.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will return to the Big Ten tournament having finished the season with a 17-13 conference record. Roster depth and new arms in the bullpen will take Penn State to the point it was at last season in the tournament.</p>\n                <p>Sam Simonic: 34-21</p>\n                <p>With a largely reshaped roster, Penn State will enter a new era with a chance of national contention. First, the Nittany Lions should have their sights set on making a run in the Big Ten Tournament.</p>\n                <p>For years, they\u2019ve been so close yet so far, and I believe Penn State will likely finish in the upper echelon of the conference and have a real shot to compete and win. Luckily for Gambino and his squad, the schedule appears favorable as the blue and white won\u2019t need to face the likes of UCLA, Michigan, USC or Indiana, all of whom finished last season as respectable teams in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Nevertheless, the Nittany Lions will play some interesting matchups early on, having to face Air Force, Grand Canyon and Kansas State before heading to Richmond to face the Spiders.Penn State has an intriguing blend of veterans, largely led by its outfield. Faces like Bryce Molinaro at third and Nate Voss behind the dish can also make a difference and give Penn State the edge in close games.</p>\n                <p>While I like Penn State to win a close one against Kansas State, I believe it will drop one on the road to an Atlantic 10 foe. From there, the Nittany Lions will play a three-game series against Indiana State, which will serve as another test. I like Penn State to drop a game there.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will face Texas Tech on the road, marking its first real test. I could see the Nittany Lions losing all three road games. The blue and white will bounce back against St. John\u2019s and Georgetown before losing a game against Iowa, beating West Virginia and sweeping Purdue.</p>\n                <p>Only Illinois, Nebraska and Oregon will serve as its upcoming Big Ten challenges and Penn State will go 5-4, losing two to Oregon and two to Illinois.</p>\n                <p>Finally, the Nittany Lions will close their regular season with a loss to West Virginia and a sweep against Minnesota. They will also lose one against Washington, defeat Pitt, and lose one on the road against Maryland.</p>\n                <p>I see the Nittany Lions going as far as the semi-finals in the Big Ten Tournament and following up last season with a slightly better year.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Beres: 35-20</p>\n                <p>Penn State enters its third campaign under Gambino, and this season will show if the Nittany Lions can finally break through. After two straight trips to the Big Ten semifinals, which included a Big Ten Championship game appearance in 2024, the blue and white are teetering on the edge of making the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2000.</p>\n                <p>With many transfers and incoming freshmen, Gambino\u2019s squad is filled with many new faces. I have Penn State winning games over Air Force and Grand Canyon, but also dropping a game against a tough Kansas State team at the MLB Desert Invitational.</p>\n                <p>After the opening weekend, the Nittany Lions continue their long slate of nonconference games. I predict the blue and white to win multiple series over Richmond, Indiana State and St. John\u2019s, before traveling to face Texas Tech. While this will be a challenging road test for Penn State, the Red Raiders finished 20-33 last season, so I have the Nittany Lions taking two of the three games.</p>\n                <p>The hardest Big Ten matchups will be against Iowa and Oregon. I ultimately have the blue and white dropping both series, but the Nittany Lions are more likely to pull off the upset against the Hawkeyes since the series is played in Happy Valley. I have Penn State finishing the regular season anywhere from six to eight in the conference, with a chance to make another run in the Big Ten Tournament and potentially earn an NCAA Tournament berth.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Felsberg: 33-22</p>\n                <p>Penn State baseball\u2019s season begins Feb. 13, against the Air Force Academy in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>\n                <p>Gambino has received 11 new players to join his squad since last season, including three top 25 prospects from the Northeast. These signings made Penn State one of two schools in the Big Ten with the most Prep Baseball Report Top 200 signings.</p>\n                <p>These new additions will change up a lot of the formation within the squad, as the new players have positions ranging all over the field.</p>\n                <p>Penn State concluded its 2025 season in the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament against Nebraska, losing 5-3. The Nittany Lions will travel to Lincoln to play the Cornhuskers this season to begin April. This game will be a competitive one, as Nebraska has lost two key players, and only has one returning starter, whereas Penn State is coming in with a reshaped team.</p>\n                <p>Looking earlier into the season, Penn State will go on a nonconference run until mid-March, in which I believe it should dominate. A large portion of these teams, including Air Force and Texas Tech, are squads that the blue and white have never seen, or haven\u2019t seen in over a decade.</p>\n                <p>As Penn State looks towards conference play, the games should get more competitive. Aside from Nebraska, the Nittany Lions will also see in-state rival, Pitt. The Panthers dominated Penn State last year, winning both of their matches by large margins.</p>\n                <p>Regardless of Penn State\u2019s wins and losses this season, I believe that with these alterations and a pretty even mix of familiar and old rematches, that Penn State will see a similar record to last year.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Content warning: This story discusses sexual misconduct. Resources and support are available through Penn State\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services.</p>\n                <p>As sexual misconduct awareness and education grow, both on and off-campus advocates are pushing for a deeper understanding of what consent means.</p>\n                <p>The National Library of Medicine reports college students often lack a clear definition of consent. The Pennsylvania Coalition to Advance Respect, an organization founded in 1975 to end sexual violence, defines consent as specific, voluntary, ongoing and coherent. It must be communicated for every activity and can be revoked at any time.</p>\n                <p>Yvette Willson said there\u2019s a need for increased education around consent.</p>\n                <p>Willson, the director of Relationship Violence Outreach, Intervention, and Community Education Center (R-VOICE), said practicing saying a firm \u201cno\u201d is important.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done a horrible disservice to girls,\u201d Willson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taught them: be nice, don\u2019t hurt somebody\u2019s feelings, and as a result, we\u2019ve taught (them) that their own desires, own wants are not important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sophia Mills said R-VOICE utilizes the \u201cF.R.I.E.S.\u201d consent model when discussing consent: freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic and specific.</p>\n                <p>Mills, associate director of R-VOICE, said the organization also designed animal stickers in an effort to normalize talking about consent. \u201cElephants for equality,\u201d and \u201cCats against cat calling\u201d are a few of the phrases featured on the stickers.</p>\n                <p>Sarah Allison said coercion, or one merely being unsure about a situation, are nuances that contribute to common misconceptions regarding consent.</p>\n                <p>Allison, a Centre Helps hotline counselor, said she often works with people who are unsure whether or not they gave consent. Acknowledging that uncertainty and allowing them room to understand some things may have been nonconsensual validates their situation.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay if you\u2019re unsure,\u201d Allison, a fourth-year studying psychology, said. \u201cIf you\u2019re uncomfortable, then I don\u2019t think that\u2019s consent.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Allison said while there are resource fairs students can attend, not everybody discovers them in time. She added the stigma behind seeking help often results in survivors feeling fearful of not being believed, which also prevents people from seeking out resources.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you have any doubt at all or any worry at all about something that happened to you, it\u2019s always okay to go get help,\u201d Allison said.</p>\n                <p>She said it\u2019s important for a person to separate themselves from any situation that makes them uncomfortable and to trust themselves in what they believe is best for them.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI encourage people to understand that they are individuals,\u201d Allison said. \u201cYou have emotions. You have feelings. You have thoughts, and all of that matters.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Education and discussion within the classroom lead to students having a better understanding of consent, according to Jennifer Pencek.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe all love to think we know about consent,\u201d Pencek, the executive director of Center Safe, said. \u201cHow are you making sure that what's going on is actually okay with them? And even if they're like, \u2018yes, let's go,\u2019 but someone is incapacitated, or someone is drunk or high, there's no consent.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Centre Safe offers protection orders from those who retaliate against the reporter.</p>\n                <p>Pencek said she\u2019d like to see more open discussion about the importance of consent. She also said it\u2019s important to offer support by listening to people and not bombarding survivors with an interrogation.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just making consent approachable,\u201d Pencek said. \u201cStop making it seem like it\u2019s way more complicated than it really is.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS CONTENT</p>",

You have to dig for it, you have to scuba dive.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While a momentary hiatus during Hons\u2019 semester abroad disrupted the band\u2019s initial momentum, Fez was still able to amass a crowd that screamed in excitement at the sound of the first few notes of each song.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was a little worried when I was in Vienna that \u2018Okay, it\u2019s over when we come back,\u2019\u201d Hons said. \u201cBut, people like it. We played at Webster\u2019s last week and had people saying they were glad we were back. So it felt nice that we have some kind of backing in the community.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite being separated for a semester and not playing consistently, through the members\u2019 long-lasting relationship they were able to jump right back into the scene.</p>\n                <p>\u201cComparatively, to a lot of other bands, I think we\u2019ve had a pretty easy time maintaining everything,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe all have a brotherly relationship, I would say, and it helps us be productive and keep good communication.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Fez most commonly plays at local house shows or venues downtown, such as The 8Ball or Manny\u2019s, but the members hope to eventually book a gig in New York City to take their music beyond State College\u2019s borders.</p>\n                <p>The band is also dedicated to ensuring the trio is enjoying the music they are creating, taking pride in handcrafting their own sound, collaborating with each other and being able to share their melodies with various audiences.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything to take away from our stream of consciousness it\u2019s that number one we like to have fun. Number two, we like to have a good time and number three, there\u2019s a little bit of something for everybody,\u201d Hons said.</p>\n                <p>While Fez plans to further expand as a band, it recognizes the importance of its foundation built in the trio\u2019s Pennsylvania upbringing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some really great memories over the course of the past three years we\u2019ve been performing gigs together,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI think that I value that more than any of the money that we\u2019ve made. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re making thousands of dollars, but I really enjoy it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

Hughes, who recorded three points on nine shots against Penn State in November, leads that offense with a Big-Ten best 40 points. His 27 assists also pace the conference, with teammate Michael Hage\u2019s 25 helpers a close second.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Hughes) is very cerebral. He has really good vision on the ice, but his skills are excellent as well,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe's a really good guy. He's a talented player who has a nose for the net. I enjoyed having him on our bench. I don't like it so much when he's on the other bench. He's a very good player.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Jack Ivankovic, Michigan\u2019s starting goaltender, saved 49 of the 53 shots he faced in his two starts against Penn State this season.

Coach Mike Gambino led the blue and white to another successful season last year, with a 33-23 record and a second straight Big Ten semifinals appearance.</p>\n                <p>Now entering their third season under Gambino, the Nittany Lions have a chance to carry their momentum from the last two years and make another run in the Big Ten Tournament, while also possibly earning an NCAA Tournament bid for the first time since 2000.</p>\n                <p>The road to the postseason starts with the blue and white\u2019s season opener against Air Force at 8 p.m. on Friday. Then the Nittany Lions face Grand Canyon at 3 p.m. on Saturday, with the opening weekend wrapping up against Kansas State at 2 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Air Force</p>\n                <p>There isn\u2019t much history between the two squads, with only one prior meeting before Friday\u2019s contest. While the Falcons look to have a bounce-back season after a rocky 2025 campaign, in which they finished 20-34, which was second-to-last in the Mountain West.</p>\n                <p>The squad finished bottom three in batting with a cumulative .281 average and also tossed an overall 7.17 ERA. However, senior Walker Zapp returns after being one of the only bright spots in Air Force\u2019s lineup last season.</p>\n                <p>The catcher stuffed the stat sheet and finished with the team\u2019s third-best average at .330, along with the second-most hits, home runs and RBIs. The Auburn, Alabama, native also reached base efficiently with a .999 OPS.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions should have an advantage in both hitting and pitching in this matchup, with a veteran-led outfield and an experienced pitching staff. Despite Ryan DeSanto heading off to MLB, the blue and white still returned some of its star pitchers.</p>\n                <p>Senior Dimond Loosli had an impressive first season at Penn State, posting a 3.82 ERA and allowing 34 hits and 17 runs over 33 innings. The Walnut Creek, California, native will likely be a shutdown reliever in the Nittany Lions\u2019 bullpen.</p>\n                <p>Grand Canyon</p>\n                <p>The Antelopes face Penn State for just the second time after they swept the series in 2018. Before leaving for the Mountain West, Grand Canyon finished fourth in the Western Atlantic with a 31-27 record.</p>\n                <p>In 2025, the Antelopes ranked in the middle of the conference with a team .295 average and 6.37 ERA. While Grand Canyon lost its two biggest bats in Josh Wakefield and Zach Yorke to the MLB draft, junior Cannon Peery will wreak havoc in the batter\u2019s box.</p>\n                <p>Last season, the first baseman finished with a .317 average, with 53 hits and 38 RBI in 167 at-bats. After many of the Antelopes top hitters left the squad, they will need solid offensive production from Peery.</p>\n                <p>On the other side of the ball, senior Elijah Higginbottom will anchor the pitching staff. The right-handed pitcher posted the team\u2019s third-best ERA last season at 4.32. Additionally, Higginbottom held a 6-0 record with 42 strikeouts over 50 innings.</p>\n                <p>This is another favorable matchup for the Nittany Lions, but they will need offensive production from one of the lone infield returners, Bryce Molinaro. The redshirt junior finished with a .267 average, 60 hits, 13 home runs and 61 RBI in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Kansas State</p>\n                <p>The Wildcats and the Nittany Lions have played four previous times, with Kansas State holding a 3-1 record over Penn State. This will be the biggest test of the weekend for the blue and white as the Wildcats enter the new season fresh off an NCAA Tournament appearance.</p>\n                <p>Kansas State finished sixth in the Big 12, with a 32-26 record, and reached the conference championship game, where it lost to Houston. Despite ranking near the bottom in the Big 12 offensively, the Wildcats can rake. The squad finished with the third-most home runs in the conference with 97, so power is one of their strong suits.</p>\n                <p>While Kansas State lost a lot of its power hitters, such as Seth Dardar, Maximum Martin and Keegan O\u2019Connor, sophomore AJ Evasco spearheads the lineup. The infielder posted the team\u2019s third-best average at .311, tied for fourth-most in home runs with 11 and held the third-most RBI with 52.</p>\n                <p>Pitching wasn\u2019t a strong suit last season, but junior Adam Arther was reliable with a team-best 2.45 ERA, with 15 strikeouts and he allowed just 20 hits over 25.2 innings. The left-hander might provide Penn State with some trouble offensively if he faces the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>The key for the blue and white will be limiting the power hits for Kansas State, while also providing its pitching staff with runs, so less pressure is on them.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL CONTENT</p>",

Despite recent wins, the Nittany Lions have still had their issues in the serving department.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s Owen Rose has 13 service aces on the year, with Gaige Gabriel trailing just behind with nine. But these aces have been a rarity in recent matches. Against Saint Francis, the Nittany Lions only put up five aces in two games.</p>\n                <p>In six matches this season, the Tigers have tallied 27 service aces, while the blue and white have 41 in 10 matches.</p>\n                <p>Kills, however, remain a strong point for the blue and white, especially for Sean Harvey.</p>\n                <p>With a team total of 407 kills on the season, the redshirt sophomore is currently responsible for 114 of those. But Princeton\u2019s Owen Mellon is No. 19 in the NCAA in kills per set, whereas Harvey trails at No. 39.</p>\n                <p>Mellon currently has 72 kills on the year, averaging about 3.60 per set. And while Harvey has more, he averages slightly less with 3.35 per set.</p>\n                <p>A few of the young stars on the team have been notable in the last few matches. Both Tristan Hassell and Jaidyn Bethel have remained consistent and played with increased confidence in recent matches.</p>\n                <p>With Hassell at 39 kills and Bethel trailing only by two at 37, the two underclassmen have shown great potential and made a big impact on the court.</p>\n                <p>Defense could be the blue and white\u2019s key to success in this matchup.</p>\n                <p>So far this year, Rose currently has 37 blocks on the year, with Gabriel trailing yet again with 30. The two middle blockers provide consistent support when shutting down the opposition's attacks, working well both individually and as a unit.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, Rose ranks No. 18, which is two places under No. 17 Tristan Whitfield in the NCAA in blocks per set. Whitfield currently has 22 blocks on the year in four less games than the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Ryan Merk\u2019s defensive effort can\u2019t be ignored either. With 76 digs on the year, the redshirt senior makes a big difference when it comes to keeping play alive. He currently sits at No. 19 in the NCAA in digs per set.</p>\n                <p>Princeton\u2019s libero, Roan Alviar, has 38 digs in four fewer matches. He ranks significantly lower in the NCAA in the very same category, coming in at No. 41.</p>\n                <p>With both competitors looking to log a few more wins this weekend, the matchup will be one to keep an eye on.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

The Cougars faced Houston Christian and Fairfield twice, while giving up just four runs.</p>\n                <p>Houston coach Chrissy Schoonmaker has made a perfect start to her first year as the Cougars\u2019 head coach, securing the program\u2019s 800th win.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Ariel Redmond had herself a productive weekend offensively and defensively.

    "description": "<p>With its sweep against Lindenwood, No. 4 Penn State closed the book on its road games this season. Eight total Nittany Lions found the back of the net against the Lions. Katie DeSa broke her own single-season shutout record with her 10th in the 5-0 win in Game 2 against Lindenwood.</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns home to close out its 2025-26 regular season in front of its crowd at Pegula. For the fifth-straight year, the Nittany Lions will conclude their season with a series against RIT.</p>\n                <p>Scouting the Tigers</p>\n                <p>This is the second series of the year between the two conference teams. The programs met at the end of November, where the Tigers kept it close in both games. It took a late third period goal from Danica Maynard in Game 2 for Penn State to earn the road sweep.</p>\n                <p>Following the series, the Tigers won five out of their next six games. They continued to maintain a steady record, putting them at third place in the AHA with a 10-12 conference record.</p>\n                <p>Sophia Bellina has been the go-to netminder throughout the season, recording a .915 save percentage and 2.54 goals against average. The senior made 76 total saves in the previous meeting with Penn State.</p>\n                <p>What stands out when looking at RIT is its power play unit. Led by Emma Pickering, who is currently tied for the most power play goals in the conference with six, the unit has proved its efficiency through its consistent passing and ability to open shooting lanes.</p>\n                <p>In their most recent game against Syracuse, the Tigers scored half of their four goals on the power play, adding to their conference-leading 34 power play goals. RIT not only shines on the man-advantage in the AHA, but sits at second in the nation in power play percentage.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, the Nittany Lions rank in the top 11 nationally in penalty figures. If Penn State is unable to stay out of the penalty box, the Tigers could use their successful unit to add to the scoreboard throughout the series.</p>\n                <p>Outstanding Outwater</p>\n                <p>Grace Outwater can\u2019t stop scoring. The Picton, Ontario, native has scored a goal in the last nine straight games. Outwater continued to hold down her position at right wing against Lindenwood; however, she found a bump up to the first line in Game 2. With the adjustment, the sophomore recorded two goals, ending a three-goal weekend.</p>\n                <p>Outwater leads the AHA in goals and is now top five in the nation with 23. She also holds the most goals scored by a sophomore in program history heading into the final regular season series.</p>\n                <p>Protect the house</p>\n                <p>Penn State has the opportunity to accomplish something it hasn\u2019t been able to since the 2020-21 season. If able to earn a conference sweep against RIT to close out the regular season, the Nittany Lions will finish with an undefeated record at home as they currently sit at 13-0.</p>\n                <p>In addition, a 15th home win would tie the program record for total home wins. This was only done once before as Penn State finished last season with a 15-2 home record. However, RIT poses a tough opponent as they are fighting for positioning in the AHA as the playoffs quickly approach.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Apparently, even love columns need a little break or maybe it was just me?</p>\n                <p>Normally, I write about hearts skipping a beat, those pesky butterflies in your stomach and all that drama that comes with dating and romance.</p>\n                <p>But today, I\u2019m trading candlelight dinners and wine glasses for sweatpants and binge-watching Heated Rivalry. Because let\u2019s be honest, some of the best love stories don\u2019t involve kissing or sex at all.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m talking about platonic love, the kind that survives your weirdest texts, your bad moods, endless tears and unhinged rants.</p>\n                <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, romantic love is beautiful. It\u2019s exciting and can oftentimes be intoxicating in the best way. Falling for someone, building intimacy, choosing someone who chooses you.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m not here to downplay that kind of love, because when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s really good.</p>\n                <p>But somewhere along the way, the larger society has placed romantic love on a pedestal. That friendships can sometimes just be placeholders until the \u201creal thing\u201d shows up.</p>\n                <p>And that\u2019s where we get it wrong.</p>\n                <p>While romantic relationships may come and go, friendships are often the steady threads that hold us together in between. They\u2019re a constant. They exist without any expectations; you\u2019re accepted exactly as you are. No pressure to perform.</p>\n                <p>Your best friend is someone who knows all your quirks and flaws and somehow, instead of running for the hills, they learn to love them too. Because that\u2019s what makes you, well, you.</p>\n                <p>We rarely acknowledge that friendships are often the relationships that catch us when romance falters. Friends are the ones who stay when things end. The ones who pick up the pieces and remind us of who we are and were before the heartbreak.</p>\n                <p>And sometimes, they\u2019re the very reason we continue to believe in love at all.</p>\n                <p>This past weekend, I left campus for a little getaway. Two days without my bestie shouldn\u2019t feel like anything, and yet it does. That\u2019s how I measure love, not by grand gestures or memories shared, but in how quickly I run back. And more importantly, how safe it feels when I get there.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m her best friend and she is mine.</p>\n                <p>I know myself and how much love I carry for my bestie. And yet, somehow it still isn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s always more to give. And the funny thing is, none of this is romantic. It\u2019s simply the pure joy of having someone who truly gets you.</p>\n                <p>So, I may not have found the guy I want to marry or the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. But I have found the person that I will walk through all seasons of life with.</p>\n                <p>She\u2019s the kind of person I can tell everything to, the one who makes life feel lighter. Everyone deserves that kind of love and person in their life. I\u2019ve found that rare soul who tolerates my extreme nonsense and still shows up with a smile. And I hope you all find someone brave enough to do the same.</p>\n                <p>Until next time, I\u2019m sending you all lots of love this Valentine\u2019s Day.</p>\n                <p>Yours truly,</p>\n                <p>Miss Behave</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

The act is a show of respect to his opponent and the fans who keep the sport relevant.</p>\n                <p>Despite being told the actions aren\u2019t standard in college, Van Ness continued to break the mold as a show of sportsmanship since arriving to the NCAA, no matter the outcome of his matches.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s something you do whether you win or lose, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem with it,\u201d Van Ness said. \u201cBut if you only do it when you win, it\u2019s not about respect at that point.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Fortunately for Van Ness, he does a lot more winning than losing. He sits undefeated on the season, and has lost just three matches since returning from a long-term injury in 2024.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness\u2019 key to success is a rampant pace that keeps opponents from getting balanced on their feet. By the time they are prepared to counter an attack by the No. 1 ranked 149-pounder, he already has their leg picked.</p>\n                <p>For the middle segment of the 2025-26 campaign, Van Ness didn\u2019t keep up his pace early in matches, giving up the first takedown on multiple occasions. That trend came to a halt in Maryland on Jan. 24.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State was racing a snowstorm in their dual against the Terrapins, the Somerville, New Jersey, native took on Carter Young. Young exploded out of the gate, jumping out to a 7-0 lead behind a takedown and near fall. Van Ness still trailed entering the second period, where he mounted the comeback, en route to a 31-15 tech fall.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI made mistakes early on but just kept focusing on getting the next point,\u201d Van Ness said.</p>\n                <p>When Van Ness arrived in Happy Valley, he didn\u2019t have that same mindset. While continuing his respect ritual, despite his coaches being opposed to it, the junior still carries the other lessons his coaches taught him his freshman year.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I was in high school, I would go down a lot in big matches,\u201d Van Ness said. \u201cI was nervous and now I don't make that happen.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Getting past those big match hiccups is a benefit of wrestling in the Big Ten. Penn State\u2019s home is the premiere wrestling conference in the nation, accounting for the last 18 national championships.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness wanted to face the best competition in the country in order to be best set to make a run at a national championship. Now, as the top-ranked wrestler in the class, he controls his own destiny towards his ultimate goal.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGoing against all these great teams going into nationals is the best preparation,\u201d Van Ness said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Rocco is the name of Matt Campbell\u2019s youngest son, but he\u2019s not the only Rocco present in the life of Penn State\u2019s new head coach.</p>\n                <p>The other is Rocco Becht, a three-year starting quarterback for Campbell at Iowa State who has followed him to State College.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI believe Penn State football is integrity, character, class, excellence, grit. He embodies every one of those traits,\u201d Campbell said of Becht last week. \u201cAnd so to me, I felt like that was such a critical opportunity for him to finish his career with us, and with the start of Penn State football, to get somebody that I truly believe embodies what the excellence of this football program stands for both on and off the field.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Last year, Becht tore his labrum in his left shoulder, which is his non-throwing shoulder, but still played the whole season. Campbell said he was \u201cshot up\u201d every Tuesday and Wednesday the last four weeks of the season just to play and give the Cyclones a chance to win.</p>\n                <p>Campbell called him \u201cone of the greatest leaders\u201d he\u2019s ever been around, and other coaches who went from Iowa State to Penn State matched that sentiment.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI love the inspiration he provides our team, because he won't be outworked,\u201d offensive coordinator Taylor Mouser said. \u201cHe wants to do whatever he can to help the team win. He lives with the linebackers. He's always with different guys. He's throwing with different guys. He lives in the training room. Just being around that guy provides confidence in everyone because of what he brings and who he's about.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mouser mentioned Becht\u2019s willingness to do what it takes to win isn\u2019t just on the football field. He talked about Becht getting after it playing spikeball at Campbell\u2019s house as well as on the golf course, though Mouser jokingly insisted Becht cheated at golf.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not just Becht that\u2019s driven. He has the ability for others to rally around him.</p>\n                <p>\u201cRocco, he's an incredible connector of people, and that's what we look for at quarterback,\u201d quarterbacks coach Jake Waters said. \u201cYou have to connect people, wherever people are from on the offense, you got to connect them. You got to sit with a different guy at dinner every night. You got to connect (offensive) lineman, receiver, tight end, running back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Waters mentioned that Becht is a quarterback with \u201ctight end blood.\u201d His dad, Anthony, played tight end in the NFL, having a career last 11 years across time with the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Arizona Cardinals and Kansas City Chiefs.</p>\n                <p>Waters also said former Jets\u2019 quarterback Chad Pennington, who was teammates with Anthony, has helped him handle game-week preparation.</p>\n                <p>So when did the Iowa State coaches realize Becht was special? Both Mouser and Waters mentioned a 2024 comeback win over UCF at home on Oct. 19. Mouser said Becht \u201ctruly put the offense on his back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite throwing a pair of pick sixes earlier in the contest, Becht orchestrated a game-winning drive in under two minutes and crossed the pylon on a 1-yard rushing touchdown to push the Cyclones 38-35 over the Knights.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTo go back and have such mental toughness to go \u2018all right, now I'm gonna do whatever it takes. I got to run to win,\u2019\u201d Waters said. \u201cAnd he made some really good throws, and to win a two-minute drive with I don't even know how many seconds left in the game on a QB sneak to go win it, told me all I need to know.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Waters said Becht will be able to start doing some things come halfway through spring ball following his injury, but the confidence in him to replace Drew Allar is clear from the coaching staff.</p>\n                <p>They believe in what he\u2019s capable of as a quarterback and a leader, and believe there\u2019s no doubt he has what it takes to be the field general the Penn State offense is looking for.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe checks all the boxes from a character standpoint,\u201d Mouser said. \u201cI have a daughter, if she married someone like Rocco, it would be the win of the century. He\u2019s got great character.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Guy Gadowsky addressed the media on Wednesday ahead of Penn State\u2019s series against the Michigan Wolverines this weekend.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky spoke on Gavin McKenna, Michigan and reflected on program history as he spoke.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he said.</p>\n                <p><a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/men_hockey/guy-gadowsky-confirms-gavin-mckennas-status-before-weekend-series-against-no-2-michigan/article_6790517d-aeb5-4a86-806d-f5016a3f88dd.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gadowsky opened by confirming that McKenna will remain a full participant for the Nittany Lions going forward.</a> Past that confirmation, Gadowsky refused to comment on other questions regarding McKenna\u2019s charges.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI hope you understand it\u2019s an ongoing legal matter, so it\u2019s inappropriate for me to comment on it,\u201d Gadowsky said.</p>\n                <p>Injuries</p>\n                <p>The first news of the press conference was the announcement that forward Alex Servagno had surgery for an injury that will keep him out for the rest of the regular season at minimum. The injury occurred on the Friday before the Beaver Stadium game, and saw Casey Aman step in at forward for Penn State. Gadowsky said Aman will retain that role moving forward.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe coaching staff has full confidence in (Aman), we\u2019re not waiting to see how he does,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s stepped in at forward in the past and done well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky stated that Aman\u2019s experience as a forward means there isn\u2019t much adjustment needed for the junior defenseman. The focus was on the physical differences between defensive and offensive forechecking, and Gadowsky stated that Aman can handle the change.</p>\n                <p>No updates were provided on Charlie Cerrato or Braedon Ford. Cerrato is expected to miss the rest of the regular season, while Ford is out \u201clong term.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Michigan</p>\n                <p>After addressing the elephant in the room, Gadowsky addressed the Nittany Lions' upcoming trip to Ann Arbor, Mich. Penn State split with the Wolverines in November. Gadowsky\u2019s takeaway from the previous series revolved around the Wolverine\u2019s lethal power play. The coach had multiple plans to avoid that problem.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s two ways to handle that,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cPlay disciplined hockey and be prepared.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky didn\u2019t have much new to say about the matchup between elite teams. Every time a new challenge arises, Gadowsky speaks on the strength of the Big Ten and the depth of talent throughout the conference. He continued to recite that sentiment on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>When asked about the schedule during the bye week, Gadowsky revealed that the team spent every day on the ice training for Michigan. They used the time to let the thrill of the Beaver Stadium game wear off and get back to work. Rather than focusing on time off, Gadowksy pushed his team to view their scheduling gauntlet as a positive.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe look at it as a great opportunity,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cPeople talk about, at the end of the year, if you\u2019re battle tested or not; there\u2019s going to be no question the Big Ten teams are battle tested.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Beaver</p>\n                <p>The final topic Gadowsky dove into is the program's history, brought out by the Beaver Stadium game on Jan. 31. He shared his perspective from the bench, seeing 40,000 people in the east-side bleachers behind him. He also expressed gratitude for the school putting the event together, while remaining amazed by the outcome.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe Super Bowl had what, 68,000 people?\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cWe had 75,000.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While speaking on the alumni to show up at the event, Gadowsky discussed the program's accomplishments over the past year. Between a Frozen Four appearance and the Beaver Stadium game, there isn\u2019t much left on Penn State hockey\u2019s list of accomplishments.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBefore we even played our first game as an independent, we made a checklist of every goal,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cFirst NCAA win, first Ross win, first playoff win, all the way down to the Frozen Four.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The only item left to check off the list for Gadowsky: A national championship.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>For the final time in the regular season, Penn State will wrestle in the Bryce Jordan Center, and it\u2019s the biggest matchup of the season.</p>\n                <p>The No. 1 Nittany Lions will wrestle No. 2 Ohio State at 7 p.m. on Friday in a battle of two undefeated squads.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what Cael Sanderson said at his weekly media availability ahead of the dual.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State</p>\n                <p>In November, Buckeyes\u2019 head coach Tom Ryan called out Penn State for not wrestling at the National Duals invitational, saying how it was a \u201cshame\u201d and it\u2019s a \u201cbit of a sign of how they see things and do things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson wasn\u2019t asked about Ryan\u2019s comments earlier this year, only offering his thoughts about the national duals, saying how it wasn\u2019t really a consideration for the Nittany Lions to wrestle it. On Wednesday, however, he offered praise for Ryan and his team.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOhio State's always a great program. Coach Ryan's done a phenomenal job, very consistent every year,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cThey're the title contender and they have an awesome program all the way around. We're excited to compete against a very good team up and down the lineup.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite the highly anticipated matchup, the mindset is still the same for Penn State, whether it\u2019s Ohio State or the looming postseason.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's pretty much the same energy in here, year-round, and same perspective,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cYour next match always seems like a big match, and it is always the most important match, but it's going to come and go quickly and we're going to be on to the next one. So it's more about development, being who we want to be, and then making sure we're training in the right direction.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh</p>\n                <p>Two years ago, Rocco Welsh was taking the mat for his freshman season as a Buckeye. During that campaign, he lost to former Nittany Lion Carter Starocci in the 174-pound national title matchup.</p>\n                <p>After redshirting the following year, Welsh transferred to Penn State and is currently the No. 1 wrestler at 184 pounds. On Friday, the Pennsylvania native will face his former team.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe recruited Rocco. He committed pretty early in the process. (Pennsylvania) kid, I mean, he's pretty similar,\u201d Sanderson said of Welsh from when he recruited him to where he is now. \u201cHe's a hammer, tough (Pennsylvania) kid. Just consistent, tough wrestling with a lot of events. Shows he loves wrestling.I think like anyone that has high aim and high goals that are coachable, they're going to keep getting better, but he was pretty stinking good in high school.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As far as facing his former team? Sanderson inferred that Welsh isn\u2019t concerned.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Penn State wrestler and part of the family. He\u2019s good,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>141 pounds</p>\n                <p>The week after Braeden Davis lost to Brock Hardy of Nebraska, Sanderson told the media Davis \u201cburned\u201d his hand leading up to the matchup in an injury related to a \u201cplugged-in scooter.\u201d</p>\n                <p>This past weekend, Davis was inactive against Michigan, with Nate Desmond filling in for him.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t wrestle Davis last week, he had a skin issue last week, so Desmond was ready to go and he stepped up and did a great job,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>The skin issue was unrelated to the burning of his hand, as Sanderson called it \u201csomething different.\u201d After missing the dual against the Wolverines, Sanderson implied that Davis will be the starter against Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to give his best effort and go compete hard,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe\u2019s shown what he\u2019s capable of. We have to keep inching along and he\u2019s going to be ready to rock here at the end.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink</p>\n                <p>Sanderson couldn\u2019t really tell what happened during Mitchell Mesenbrink\u2019s matchup against Michigan. All he saw was him and his opponent, Justin Gates, \u201cflying around with elbows and knees.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe got hit pretty good and got a pretty, pretty nasty cut,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cAnd to his credit, was able to just keep his composure and go get that next takedown and win the match.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink ended up with a 20-5 victory over Gates. Despite the brutal blow, there was no concern from Sanderson as far as his status moving forward.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou have to be careful with it. Obviously, they have face masks you can wear and kind of hope that it will take care of it,\u201d Sanderson said. But, at the end of the day, it is what it is. You got to go forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State opened the season with a victory over Richmond last year, kickstarting the Kayla Treanor era in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>On Wednesday afternoon, that momentum continued as the Nittany Lions defeated UMass 17-9 inside Holuba Hall.</p>\n                <p>After a pair of freshmen took the starting lineup on Saturday, only four-star attacker Rocquette Allen earned that spot against the Minutewomen.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions weren\u2019t messing around as things got underway Wednesday afternoon, as Julia Basciano forced an early turnover, giving fellow transfer Anna Salerno a shot at the net. After her first shot attempt was high, Salerno capitalized on her second goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>Over the next three minutes, Penn State went 3-for-3 shooting, as Kelly MacKinney, Erika Ho and Allen each extended its lead.</p>\n                <p>During that stretch, the Minutewomen struggled to get anything going offensively with three shots \u2014 only one on goal.</p>\n                <p>After a quieter, four-minute period where the Nittany Lions didn\u2019t score, the action picked right back up as MacKinney put No. 2 of the day in the back of the net, putting the blue and white up by five.</p>\n                <p>Allen\u2019s freshman year success continued as she recorded her fourth goal in two games with an assist from the recent Tewaaraton award nominee Erika Ho.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions took a dominant 6-0 lead into the second quarter, which was quickly extended by a goal from Emma Kelly less than a minute into the period.</p>\n                <p>The Minutewomen entered a man-down situation after both Katie Onderdonk and Katie Peterson were issued green cards, which Allen capitalized on with her third goal of the game as she moved to the team\u2019s leading goal scorer.</p>\n                <p>Both sides exchanged fire through the middle of the second quarter, but it was Penn State that came out again in the winning column as Ho recorded goal No. 2 of the day.</p>\n                <p>After 17 minutes of silence from UMass\u2019 offense, Brigid Manning scored the team\u2019s first goal after a yellow card on Susannah O\u2019Connell. However, Penn State\u2019s offense kept swinging and scored its 10th goal of the game off a shot from Delaney Radin.</p>\n                <p>UMass came out of the break with a bit of momentum, scoring on its first shot from Oderdonk. It scored its second straight goal six minutes later, before Allen pushed Penn State\u2019s lead back to eight points.</p>\n                <p>Both teams exchanged goals again within just a minute of each other, as MacKinney earned her first hat trick of the season. After a foul on UMass\u2019 Lil Hancock, Ho recorded a hat trick, as she capitalized on the free position shot.</p>\n                <p>However, the Minutewomen continued the Happy Valley shootout as Ava Connaughton trimmed the deficit, followed by another goal from Brigid Welch.</p>\n                <p>After five goals from UMass in the third quarter, the Nittany Lions took control of the fourth quarter with another goal from Radin, assisted by Ho. However, that was quickly matched by another free-position goal from the Minutewomen.</p>\n                <p>Following a foul from UMass\u2019 Marisa Gatz, Salerno tabbed her second goal of the day, off a free position goal. Less than two minutes later, Allen scored her fifth goal of the day and seventh on the season, to make the score 16-7.</p>\n                <p>UMass added another two goals down the final stretch \u2014 capped off with another Penn State goal \u2014 as the Nittany Lions rode to the victory column for the second straight game.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions stay home and will take on Bucknell at 11 a.m. on Sunday.

    "description": "<p>Penn State didn\u2019t just have 10 wrestlers compete against Michigan on Friday, but also had ties to many other events happening around the world.</p>\n                <p>The Zagreb Open, state championships and collegiate dual seasons headlined the Nittany Lions\u2019 competing not just around the nation, but around the world.</p>\n                <p>Zagreb Open</p>\n                <p>The Zagreb Open had two Nittany Lion Wrestling Club members compete. Current Penn State wrestler Tyler Kasak, representing the USA, continuing his freestyle season while redshirting the collegiate season. He was joined by NLWC member Roman Bravo-Young.</p>\n                <p>Bravo-Young returned to the NLWC after wrestling under the Cowboy Wrestling Club with Oklahoma State. Representing Mexico, Bravo-Young kicked off the open with a victory over India\u2019s Atish Todkar at 57 kilograms.</p>\n                <p>It appeared as if Bravo-Young and Olympic silver medalist, Spencer Lee, were on a collision course to the finals after Bravo-Young\u2019s 12-2 victory over USA\u2019s Anthony Knox. He made it into the finals to face Lee with a 10-0 win over Iran\u2019s Milad Jahangir Valizadeh.</p>\n                <p>With a highly anticipated matchup with Lee, it ended quickly with Bravo-Young having to injury default partway through the match. He ended with a second-place finish.</p>\n                <p>Kasak competed at 70 kilograms, wrestling Austria\u2019s Alexander Seiwald in the first round. He dominated with an 11-0 victory before falling in his next match to India\u2019s Abhimanyou Abhimanyou 10-0. Kasak\u2019s journey came to an end there, not earning a spot in the repechage.</p>\n                <p>High school state championships</p>\n                <p>With high school seasons quickly coming to an end, Penn State commits are in the midst of postseason competition. Clinton Shepherd competed in the IHSAA Regional Tournament in Indiana. Shepherd rolled through his competition at 150 pounds, winning by fall in 1:21, an 18-2 tech fall in 1:28 and a fall in the finals in just 20 seconds. He\u2019s listed as the No. 8 recruit in the 2027 class per FloWrestling and the second-highest rated Penn State commit.</p>\n                <p>In Pennsylvania, Landon Sidun competed in the 3A PIAA State Championship Duals. Sidun, a part of Norwin\u2019s program, defeated his first opponent by fall in just 24 seconds. Norwin won once again in the semifinals, this time against Council Rock South. He wrestled up to 127 pounds, from his usual 121 pound spot, and won by tech fall in 2:16.</p>\n                <p>Sidun and Norwin faced fellow WPIAL high school, Franklin Regional, losing 29-24. Sidun earned his team six points, winning by forfeit as Franklin Regional didn\u2019t put a wrestler against the No. 2 prospect in the 2027 class.</p>\n                <p>Also in the 3A bracket was State High, and 2027 commit James Whitbred. The future Nittany Lion won by tech fall over Franklin Regional\u2019s Jordan Perks at 160 pounds.</p>\n                <p>Similar to Sidun, Whitbred wrestled in a different class in the second match, wrestling at 152, except State High was in the consolations. Once again, Whitbred won by tech fall despite his school\u2019s loss.</p>\n                <p>The two Pennsylvania wrestlers will compete in the individual tournaments that end in March in Hershey, Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Transfers</p>\n                <p>Just one of the three Penn State transfers who are now with former Nittany Lion David Taylor at Oklahoma State competed in the Cowboys\u2019 dual against Little Rock. No. 7 Alex Facundo at 174 pounds won by fall against unranked Bronson Baxter.</p>\n                <p>Facundo has bounced back from a rough first couple weeks of the season, holding a 13-4 record on the year.</p>\n                <p>No. 12 David Evans at 149 pounds also competed over the weekend. He faced an unranked Devon Harrison in Utah Valley\u2019s dual against North Dakota State. He won by tech fall, 18-3, as the clock hit seven minutes.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Before its season began, Penn State went on a team retreat to Philadelphia, and used it as a moment to be together as a team without worrying about softball.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen you have moments with your squad where it\u2019s literally just enjoying each other's company and not having to talk about softball,\u201d coach Clarisa Crowell said in Wednesday\u2019s media session. \u201cI think that trip really just helped us grow together and build relationships.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the team's trip was their inspiration from the Rocky franchise.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey just really bought into the story of Rocky, in the state of Pennsylvania, especially in Philadelphia, Rocky is like a real person,\u201d Crowell said. \u201cHe was just a blue-collar, tough, gritty guy, which is honestly the makeup of our team, and how our team has won here at Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Winning is what the Nittany Lions did in their opening weekend, going 4-1, and showed their grittiness by battling out two extra-inning victories.</p>\n                <p>Penn State showed its toughness and fighting edge in all aspects of the game. At the plate, the Nittany Lions posted a .441 team slugging percentage. Additionally, five players finished the weekend with a .250-plus batting average.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white also showed how it can get things done in the circle, after going five arms deep in its rotation. The staff posted a 1.46 ERA and combined for 42 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis year we\u2019re going to win games because we\u2019re going to be well-balanced,\u201d Crowell said. \u201cThere are going to be games where it\u2019s going to have to be pitching and defense, and there\u2019s going to be games where we\u2019re going to have to rely on the bats.\u201d</p>\n                <p>To keep the Rocky theme that Penn State has embodied, in Rocky IV, the Italian Stallion takes on Russian Ivan Drago on Christmas Day in 1985. Rocky was a severe underdog heading to face Drago on his home turf in Moscow.</p>\n                <p>For the first six rounds or so, the match is all Drago, and it looks like Rocky will go down without an easy fight, but then the Pride of Philadelphia finds his momentum as Drago starts to wear down.</p>\n                <p>Rocky never stops fighting and takes Drago to 15 rounds and comes up with the improbable underdog victory, without ever giving up.</p>\n                <p>Now consider Penn State\u2019s eight-inning victory over BYU. After three innings, the blue and white had just one hit as opposed to the Cougars\u2019 four, and found themselves down 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Penn State continued to struggle offensively. Heading into the seventh inning, BYU held a 3-1 lead and out-hit the Nittany Lions 7-5. However, Penn State never stopped fighting and recorded two hits and two runs to send the game to extras.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions ultimately broke through in the eighth inning with an RBI single from Kirsten Finarelli to win the game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo matter what the score is, they\u2019re going to keep fighting to the end,\u201d Crowell said.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not just Rocky\u2019s mindset that the team is bringing to the dugout, but they\u2019ve got all the props to go along with it.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen they hit home runs, one game they\u2019re putting the Rocky gloves over the neck, then one game they\u2019re putting on the robe,\u201d Crowell said. \u201cWe ended up in a gift shop, and everybody was buying Rocky stuff.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s safe to say Penn State will always have a piece of Rocky Balboa in its dugout, both mentally and physically, as they carry on the rest of the season.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State entered this week with just one Big Ten win this season, but that\u2019s changed after Wednesday night.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions earned a 63-60 win over Washington inside Alaska Airlines Arena in Seattle, improving to 11-14 on the year and 2-12 in Big Ten play. It was a close game throughout that featured 15 lead changes and nine ties.</p>\n                <p>Penn State had a halftime lead in a Big Ten game for the fourth time this season, holding a 35-32 advantage at the break. Following an early 10-0 run by the Nittany Lions, both teams were battling as neither squad could pull away from the other.</p>\n                <p>The two teams were attacking the paint in the first half, with both teams scoring 20 points in the paint. Guard Freddie Dilione V made back-to-back baskets before guard Melih Tunca knocked down a turnaround jumper, which gave Penn State a six-point lead, but guard Quimari Peterson drained a key 3-pointer late to put Washington down by just one possession at halftime.</p>\n                <p>Coming out of the break, Penn State managed to build a 47-41 lead behind a pair of 3-pointers by forward Josh Reed. Wing Eli Rice, who returned from a two-game absence due to injury, also made a jumper to give the Nittany Lions their six-point advantage.</p>\n                <p>However, Penn State went on a four-minute stretch in which it didn\u2019t make a field goal, allowing Washington to retake the lead, 49-48. The field-goal drought continued for over six minutes as forward Hannes Steinbach knocked down a triple to give the Huskies a 54-51 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Dilione pulled the Nittany Lions out of its cold streak with two baskets, guard Kayden Mingo followed it up with a layup as Penn State remained knotted with Washington, 57-57, with 3:07 left. As the two teams kept battling, Mingo made a tough basket in the paint via a goaltending call to give Penn State a 61-59 lead with 1:21 remaining.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 defense got a key stop on the ensuing defensive possession, but weren\u2019t able to build on their lead. Steinbach drew a foul for the Huskies, though he went 1-of-2 at the line as his squad remained down by one point.</p>\n                <p>Rice was fouled on the inbounds pass, and he went 2-of-2 on his free throws. Penn State got another stop on the defensive end, but Reed turned the ball over on the ensuing inbounds pass.</p>\n                <p>The defense got one more stop with Peterson and guard Wesley Yates III both missing a 3-pointer in the waning seconds that clinched the victory for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Dilione ended up pacing Penn State, tallying a team-high 16 points on 7-of-14 shooting. Reed, Mingo and Rice were all in double figures as well with 14, 13 and 12 points, respectively.</p>\n                <p>As a whole, the Nittany Lions shot 48.1% from the field and 38.5% from 3-point range. Washington was less efficient at 37.7% shooting from the field and 33.3% shooting from 3-point range, but it had 15 second-chance points.</p>\n                <p>Steinbach led the Huskies with 19 points and 14 rebounds, while Yates had 11 points on 5-of-15 shooting from the field. Washington won the rebound battle 37 to 31, and it had 14 offensive boards.</p>\n                <p>Injury report</p>\n                <p>Forward Sa\u0161a Ciani was listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d on the pregame availability report. He ended up playing, first subbing in at the 13:44 mark of the second half and ending a four-game absence due to an ankle injury.</p>\n                <p>Forward Tibor Mirti\u010d remained listed as \u201cout\u201d for Wednesday\u2019s matchup against Washington.</p>\n                <p>Mirti\u010d first picked up a knee injury in the Michigan game on Jan. 6. During his first practice back from that injury, he injured his shoulder, which has kept him out since the Northwestern game on Jan. 29.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will stay on the West Coast for the rest of this week as it\u2019ll visit Oregon at 3 p.m. ET Saturday inside Matthew Knight Arena in Eugene, Oregon, aired on the Big Ten Network. The Ducks are 8-16 on the year and 1-12 in Big Ten play, including a current 10-game losing streak.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Nine Penn State players are set to showcase their talents in front of NFL scouts.</p>\n                <p>The NFL Scouting Combine invited quarterback Drew Allar, running back Nick Singleton, running back Kaytron Allen, tight end Khalil Dinkins, left guard Vega Ioane, left tackle Drew Shelton, defensive end Dani Dennis-Sutton, defensive tackle Zane Durant and safety Zakee Wheatley to participate in the event, which lasts from Feb. 23-March 2 inside Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.</p>\n                <p>319 prospects invited to 2026 NFL Scouting Combine.<a href=\"https://t.co/YOakXu8d7q\">https://t.co/YOakXu8d7q</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/uwEMPiOTk9\">pic.twitter.com/uwEMPiOTk9</a>&mdash; NFL Draft (@NFLDraft) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFLDraft/status/2021605307114263007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 11, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>Allar is one of 15 gunslingers who will be featured in the combine. He threw for 1,100 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions this past season before enduring a season-ending injury after six games.</p>\n                <p>Singleton broke his foot during a practice at the Senior Bowl in January. Prior to his injury, he set Penn State's all-time touchdown record with 55 career scores.</p>\n                <p>Allen reset the record book as well with 4,180 career rushing yards. He had 1,303 rushing yards this past season, including a 226-yard game against Rutgers, and was named to the AP All-America third team.</p>\n                <p>Dinkins started nine games for the Nittany Lions in 2025, and he totaled 37 catches for 399 yards and seven touchdowns in his career.</p>\n                <p>Ioane and Shelton both anchored the left side of the offensive line last season. Ioane earned second-team AP All-America honors while Shelton started all 11 games he played.</p>\n                <p>Dennis-Sutton notably didn't opt out of the Pinstripe Bowl, where he tallied four tackles and two sacks. It capped off a season that saw him earn third-team All-Big Ten honors.</p>\n                <p>Wheatley and Durant were both All-Big Ten honorable mentions in 2025. Wheatley racked up 74 tackles, a pass breakup and an interceptions while Durant totaled 25 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss and four sacks.</p>\n                <p>The mark is a leap from the five invitees last season, though under the 10 players invited to the combine in 2024.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Josh Reed is listed as a forward on Penn State\u2019s roster, but he\u2019s played more than just one position this season.</p>\n                <p>Most notably, Reed recently saw action at center due to numerous injuries in the frontcourt. But it hasn\u2019t mattered where Reed plays on the floor lately \u2014 he\u2019s scored in double figures the past eight games as he\u2019s having a career year.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI commend Josh Reed for playing multiple positions all year long at 30-40 pounds out of position,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cGiving up that weight and then playing 30, sometimes 35 minutes plus. He's been battling, and he's had a great year, battling and getting better as the year went on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Reed transferred to Penn State for his last season of collegiate eligibility after three years with Cincinnati. He\u2019s been a regular in the starting lineup, averaging a career-high 10.5 points per game along with a personal best of 50.9% shooting from the field across 24 appearances.</p>\n                <p>The Atlanta native was a rotational player during his time with the Bearcats. He never averaged more than 4.8 points per game or shot better than 41% from the field, highlighting the jump in production he\u2019s taken in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>On the glass, Reed is averaging a career-high 3.9 rebounds per game, which is the second most on the team behind 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107. He has 29 offensive rebounds this season, as guard Freddie Dilione V noted Reed\u2019s ability to create extra possessions after he tallied 13 points and 10 rebounds in a 74-72 loss to No. 2 Michigan on Jan. 6.</p>\n                <p>Reed\u2019s latest performance saw him total 17 points and four rebounds with 8-of-11 shooting from the field and 1-of-3 shooting from 3-point range in a 77-75 loss to USC on Sunday. He was one of three Penn State players with a positive point differential, finishing at +1 across 37 minutes played.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust trying to play confident and aggressive,\u201d Reed said postgame. \u201cI know how my coaches and my teammates have stressed they believe in me. I just want to win, so come out there and play aggressive and confident, and my teammates make me better as well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 recent slew of injuries is beginning to subside, with Juri\u0107 already back and wing Eli Rice's return to action imminent. But there were two games where Juri\u0107, forward Sa\u0161a Ciani and forward Tibor Mirti\u010d all missed, forcing Reed to play center out of \u201cnecessity,\u201d Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Particularly in the Minnesota game on Feb. 1, Reed, who\u2019s listed at 6-foot-8 and 230 pounds, started at center and played 35 minutes. He helped guide Penn State to a 77-75 victory after logging 18 points and four rebounds with 6-of-10 shooting from the field and 4-of-5 shooting from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was actually pretty fun getting to play the center spot,\u201d Reed said following the win on Feb. 3. \u201cI feel like the way we played was a little bit different. I feel like that helped us \u2026 it was definitely fun doing that \u2014 something I've never done before.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The small-ball lineup with Reed starting at center was in action again when the Nittany Lions faced the Wolverines on Feb. 5, but Michigan\u2019s talented frontcourt with players like 7-foot-3 center Aday Mara made it difficult to find any success. Penn State lost 110-69, which prompted Rhoades to say his team was \u201cundermanned\u201d postgame.</p>\n                <p>Over the Nittany Lions\u2019 last five games, Reed\u2019s been the team\u2019s center 27% of the time, according to KenPom. Moving forward, Rhoades mentioned the issues with using a small-ball lineup in the Big Ten due to the size in the conference, but it\u2019s possible to \u201cget away with it here and there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>If Reed continues to be a versatile player and gets more time at the five as the season goes on, he feels Penn State\u2019s offense could create mismatches.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI just felt like we were able to do some different things out there that we normally don't do,\u201d Reed said on Feb. 3. \u201cWhen I'm setting a screen for Kayden (Mingo) or Freddie, they get the five-man on them, and then I get the one or two-man on me. I feel like we use those to our advantage.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Many students come to college and experience their first bouts of freedom, which allows them to explore their beliefs and perspectives absent of familial influence. For many, it\u2019s at the collegiate level where they form firm views on sex and relationships.</p>\n                <p>Carmelita Whitfield, University Health Services\u2019s associate director of community health, said talking about sexual education is important to ensuring that people, even at a young age, have the knowledge and resources to prevent the possibility of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well as unplanned pregnancies.</p>\n                <p>She said open discussions with family members and relatives allow children to feel more comfortable asking questions.</p>\n                <p>Whitfield also said the lack of a nationwide policy ensuring comprehensive sexual education is taught across the United States, as well as a sense of discomfort from instructors to broach the subject, has left some students at a disadvantage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere are a lot of cultural taboos (and) there's a culture of silence that we also talk about, like, \u2018If I don't say anything, then I'll just know or I'll ask my friend,\u2019 but if you think about it, our friends are our age so what do they know and where are they getting their information?\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cTeachers are often uncomfortable. They can teach you the basics but they don't have the bandwidth to talk about, perhaps, sexual assault or gender identity and that's why it is so important that when you're doing this work that you are well-rounded and well-versed.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Anne Pallozzi said her views on sex were largely influenced by discussions with her parents.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI have a very open relationship with my parents so we've had these conversations and I was raised with two loving parents so my views didn't change,\u201d Pallozzi, a second-year studying biology, said.</p>\n                <p>On the contrary, Joseph Galo said he didn\u2019t begin learning about sexual education until middle school due to his parents not discussing it with him beforehand.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe didn't really learn anything up until that point but I'm pretty sure we had the class and the talk where we talked about it in fifth grade, I think,\u201d Galo, a second-year studying electrical engineering, said. \u201cI guess people could be on the internet but, I mean, my parents didn't say nothing to me until that point.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said his sexual education during that time was limited to discussing basic topics and answering questions a \u201ctypical middle schooler could have.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kendall Thomas said her sexual education was often rooted in fears that stuck with her as she entered college.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI am already overly cautious in that particular area in the first place and we did talk about sexual violence a lot in my school \u2026 so I would just say that, from the get-go, I already looked at it from a cautious standpoint so now, coming to college and it being like a hub for just chlamydia and a whole bunch of germs and other things, I've already just like, \u2018Yeah, I'm good,\u2019\u201d Thomas, a second-year studying art history, said.</p>\n                <p>Jason Burney said Penn State should do more to promote sexual education resources through social media and in high-traffic areas on campus.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don't think we hear it enough, I would say, \" Burney, a second-year studying finance, said. \u201cI think we're mature enough to know about these things \u2018cause a lot of people are being intimate in college as their first time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Izzy Roberti agrees with Burney that Penn State needs to improve its efforts when it comes to making students aware of sexual health resources on campus.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was in this class that was teaching philosophy of pacifism and we had a day where someone came in and she talked about various mental health resources and she had a segment specifically about resources for sexual violence or if you are part of the LGBTQ community, where you can go and feel safe,\u201d Roberti, a first-year studying history and philosophy, said. \u201cI feel like I've been made pretty aware of the services we have on campus, but I would not say it's a very outward thing that we talk about.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Whitfield said disparities in sexual education greatly impact groups such as the LGBTQ+ community who may not have access to care specialized to their needs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you're transitioning, you're going to need that level of care that, say, someone who is just coming in for regular birth control may not really need,\u201d Whitfield said.</p>\n                <p>She said it\u2019s important for there to be a wide range of sexual education resources available on and off-campus as it empowers individuals to make their own decision in regards to their sexual health.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSex-ed, honestly, is more than just biology. It's just teaching individuals really how to set boundaries and respect the boundaries of themselves as well as others,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cA \u2018no\u2019 doesn't necessarily mean a \u2018no\u2019 forever. It could just mean a \u2018no\u2019 for right now but you got to learn to respect the \u2018no.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "How intimacy shapes college relationships",
    "author": "Skylar Williamson I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>For many college students, intimacy is often viewed as a narrow idea: dating, hook-ups or relationships. In reality, intimacy in college relationships looks different for everyone.</p>\n                <p>Whether it\u2019s opening up emotionally to someone you trust or navigating becoming physically close to a new partner, college should be a time where people begin to understand their definition of intimacy.</p>\n                <p>Intimacy generally falls into two different categories: emotional or physical. Emotional intimacy involves trust, vulnerability and communication, whereas physical intimacy focuses on touch, affection and sex.</p>\n                <p>In college relationships, however, the environment can play a huge role in what type of intimacy is most prevalent. Busy schedules, social pressure, alcohol and evolving personal identities all play a factor in how intimacy is reflected.</p>\n                <p>For Brooke Benevento, who is interested in becoming a sex therapist, relationships should involve both emotional and physical intimacy. She thinks emotional security is the first step to a healthy long-term connection.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen people truly feel safe, they can share their thoughts, boundaries and desires openly, which creates a stronger, healthier connection,\u201d Benevento, a fourth-year studying rehabilitation and human services, said. \u201cIn my experience, whether a relationship is new or long-term, prioritizing clarity and security sets the tone for everything that follows, making all forms of intimacy more meaningful and fulfilling.\"</p>\n                <p>On college campuses, experimentation with intimacy is normal. With this level of trial and error, Benevento said college connections can lean towards prioritizing physical rather than emotional intimacy.</p>\n                <p>\u201cDating apps and hook-up culture make connections fast and convenient, but they can also discourage people from being intentional and authentic,\u201d Benevento said. \u201cCollege intimacy can be intense and meaningful, but it often requires extra effort to sustain emotional depth.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As hook-up culture and quick physical connections are becoming more popular for young adults on college campuses, some students are starting to breakaway from that stigma.</p>\n                <p>Mark Kormos said many students on campus are letting go of \u201chook-up culture\u201d and constant physical intimacy for something deeper.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe are all broken and seeking to be healed,\u201d Kormos, a third-year studying economics, said. \u201cSometimes we think that physical pleasure will help us with that, but eventually the pleasure wears off and we remain broken.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kormos said students are finding more meaningful ways to fill their time, hoping that later leads them to building strong emotional connections.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen we find healing \u2014 possibly through prayer, meditation, friends, social groups or clubs \u2014 we then see more clearly what physical pleasure could never do,\u201d Kormos said.</p>\n                <p>Although everyone\u2019s version of intimacy may look different, the root of both is communication through partners. In college relationships, communication can be strained.</p>\n                <p>Dr. Autumn Keefer, a couples therapy coordinator on campus, said there are several problems she commonly sees with couples.

Some students prioritize emotional closeness, while others feel more comfortable exploring physical intimacy, and some students fall somewhere in between.</p>\n                <p>College is a time where exploring intimacy is encouraged, and no answer is the right one. In an environment where comparison and assumptions are easy to make, understanding intimacy is not one-size-fits-all can be freeing.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAt the core, everyone wants to feel valued, desired and emotionally safe,\u201d Benevento said. \u201cSeeing both sides has made me more aware of how different environments shape the way people approach relationships.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>After going 1-1 last week, Penn State is back on the road with five games left on the year.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions travel to College Park for a matchup with No. 20 Maryland at 7 p.m. on Thursday.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has some recent history off the court with Maryland, after acquiring Ann Meyer Drysdale Award Winner Ashley Owusu from the Terrapins in 2023 and almost losing Gracie Merkle to them last offseason.</p>\n                <p>All-time matchups</p>\n                <p>Maryland is one of the few Big Ten teams against which the Lady Lions have a losing record, sitting at just 16-22 all-time.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have struggled recently, losing 15 of its last 16 matchups to the Terrapins, including an 82-73 loss at home last season in the Return to Rec game. It was the Merkle and Gabby Elliott show, as the pair combined for 47 points.</p>\n                <p>Prior to the rough stretch, the Lady Lions held a dominant six-game win streak from 1998 to 2003, winning four of the games by a double-digit margin. Penn State\u2019s last victory came on Jan. 28, 2024, when it beat Maryland 112-76. Makenna Marisa scored 24 points, while Owusu tabbed 16 against her former team.</p>\n                <p>2025-26 Maryland</p>\n                <p>Maryland was one of the last undefeated teams in the nation, winning 14 straight games.</p>\n                <p>On New Year\u2019s Day, that changed, as it fell in a three-point nail biter to Illinois. Since then, the Terrapins have fallen to No. 19 Ohio State and endured a four-game losing streak to UCLA, Iowa, Washington and Oregon.</p>\n                <p>After losing Merkle in the portal, coach Brenda Frese added 6-foot-3 Indiana transfer Yarden Garzon to the squad.</p>\n                <p>Despite sitting second on the team in scoring, the Ra'anana, Israel, native leads the conference in made 3-pointers. Garzon recorded 69 baskets from behind the arc, which ranks tied for 15th in school history with five games left on the year.</p>\n                <p>Garzon has been a big part in the team\u2019s recent success, scoring 27 points in the team\u2019s defeats of No. 12 Michigan State and Nebraska over the past two weeks.</p>\n                <p>Thursday\u2019s matchup</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s biggest problem heading into Thursday\u2019s matchup is junior guard Oluchi Okananwa, who leads the Terrapins with 17.2 points per game.</p>\n                <p>In addition to her scoring success, the 5-foot-10 guard is also a dominant rebounder, leading the team with 76 offensive rebounds, the third-most in the conference.</p>\n                <p>While Kiyomi McMiller doesn't share the offensive rebounding capabilities of Okananwa, her flashy scoring will likely create a skirmish on the scoreboards between the two. McMiller leads the Lady Lions with 20.2 points per game and scored 14 last year against Maryland when suiting up with Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>Thursday night will likely be a battle of those two leading scorers and which supporting cast can generate the strongest attack.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Big Ten Recap | Conference squads begin to separate in standings with postseason a month away",
    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>There is about a month until the Big Ten basketball tournament, and the conference already appears to be in postseason form.</p>\n                <p>The excitement for the tournament is palpable: for the first time, all conference teams make the postseason under the 18-team format, meaning the standings matter only for seeding, not participation.</p>\n                <p>In the last week of play, there\u2019s been some massive shakeups in those seedings as some squads made last-minute statements before the Big Ten heads to Chicago.</p>\n                <p>Outstanding Overtimes</p>\n                <p>Saturday was one of the best single days in basketball ever; only one of the five matchups wasn\u2019t decided within two possessions \u2014 highlighted by a pair of overtime thrillers.</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin kicked off the action on the day with a one-point defeat at the hands of Indiana.</p>\n                <p>Hoosiers star forward, Lamar Wilkerson, decided the game at the foul line, as his normally slick three-point shot failed to show up, he\u2019d built a house with all his bricks from behind the arc, finishing 1-of-8.</p>\n                <p>Although Wilkerson still got his buckets, with a team-high 25 points, he also added four assists. It was the Badgers\u2019 star forward, Nolan Winter, who stole the spotlight, edging out Wilkerson with 26 points on the night, shooting 9-of-13.</p>\n                <p>It wasn\u2019t Winter who got the final shot for Wisconsin, however, as guard Braeden Carrington hucked up a three that didn\u2019t fall. It was a questionable decision to put the ball in the senior\u2019s hands. Carrington shoots 40.5% on the year and shot below that figure in his last four outings, including the clash against the Hoosiers.</p>\n                <p>With this win and a blowout against Oregon on Monday, in which Wilkerson posted a 41-point performance, Indiana narrowed the gap on the Badgers in the standings.</p>\n                <p>The top of the Big Ten standings also saw an overtime contest narrow the gap when, on Saturday, Michigan State upset Illinois, with the Fighting Illini unable to mount a late-game comeback against the Spartans.</p>\n                <p>Guard Jeremy Fears Jr. led the green and white\u2019s effort in a bounce-back 26 point performance after the sophomore had a down performance against Minnesota on Wednesday. In the same game he received criticism for his polarizing backwards groin kick of a Golden Gophers defender.</p>\n                <p>In the standings, only one game now separates the Fighting Illini and Spartans for the third spot in the conference, pending results for Nebraska\u2019s next game.</p>\n                <p>Marquee Moments</p>\n                <p>While not every game needed extra time to decide, there were still some close contests throughout the week where big-time Big Ten moments were made.</p>\n                <p>The first came as part of an effort that prevented overtime. USC standout freshman Alijah Arenas continued his hyped rookie campaign with a last-second shot over Penn State on Sunday, hijacking the Nittany Lions\u2019 effort to earn its second conference win a week after it earned its first.</p>\n                <p>Other conference competitors delivered on their efforts to secure their second Big Ten wins; Maryland defeated Minnesota on the same day, thanks to a 29-point efficient scoring performance by Diggy Coit.</p>\n                <p>The result elevates the Terrapins into a group of three conference teams, joined by Rutgers and Northwestern, with only a pair of Big Ten wins and a chance to separate from the pack.</p>\n                <p>The group that leaves at the bottom \u2014 Penn State and Oregon \u2014 is set for a looming clash in the upcoming week, a game that\u2019ll hand possession of the bottom tournament seed to one single squad.</p>\n                <p>In the new format, the bottom of the conference squads actually play each other in a format that resembles the NBA\u2019s play-in tournament. All seedings on Day 1 of tournament play are currently within one game of each other in standings, so shakeups should be expected.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State hasn\u2019t had many bright moments this season. In the midst of one of its worst seasons ever, and one that coach Carolyn Kieger will seek to leave behind, there are still signs of success.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions aren\u2019t going away. As the season quickly nears the finish line, the blue and white are playing with pride.</p>\n                <p>McMiller untapped a new level</p>\n                <p>In the earlier stages of the season, Penn State had lost its identity. With many new faces and just four returners, the Lady Lions had much uncharted territory.</p>\n                <p>Who would be the leading scorer? Who would be the alpha? Who would take the next step? All those questions had to be answered, but were largely ignored amid an 11-game losing streak, with 11-straight Big Ten losses.</p>\n                <p>Hope for a notably better season quickly faded, and most importantly, many of the early green flags had turned red. The biggest one was Kiyomi McMiller.</p>\n                <p>McMiller was a highly touted recruit coming out of high school before committing to Rutgers. After averaging 18.7 points with the team, she entered the transfer portal only to end up in State College.</p>\n                <p>Across the town from New Brunswick, this Big Ten foe presented an opportunity for McMiller not only to take charge in leading the team but also to have a better chance at winning.</p>\n                <p>After a convincing start to the season, McMiller emerged as Penn State\u2019s best offensive threat. What followed was a cold streak. While McMiller was reaching double figures \u2014 on some nights, north of 20 points \u2014 she quickly lost the spark that kept the team afloat.</p>\n                <p>Nevertheless, her play of late has propelled Penn State to some of its best basketball this season in winning its first Big Ten game on the road at Purdue. McMiller scored 30 points as well as nine assists and five rebounds in her impressive performance.</p>\n                <p>Following that, she replicated the same energy against then-No. 12 Michigan State, where McMiller scored a career-high 37 points with eight rebounds in a close 81-70 loss.</p>\n                <p>The shooting splits have been the biggest difference, as in both outings, the Lady Lion averaged nearly 50% from the field and above that from three.</p>\n                <p>To this point, it\u2019s safe to say that McMiller is Penn State\u2019s leader, who has loads of potential stored in the tank.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s first Big Ten win</p>\n                <p>The impossible was possible.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions finally did it, and they did it in a thrilling fashion. After what felt like an endless cycle of losses and the epitome of brutality in the Big Ten, the blue and white cleaned up to earn its first conference win.</p>\n                <p>Penn State became the laughing stock of women\u2019s basketball after an 11-game conference losing streak. The team was seriously on the brink of earning a winless season in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>After losing in a close defeat against Wisconsin in early January, the Lady Lions faced a tough stretch of ranked opponents and endured many blowout defeats.</p>\n                <p>Then, mid-January welcomed an opportunity to get back in the win column. The Lady Lions were facing Rutgers for its annual White Out game as the winning opportunity was hoped to be seized.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers was the second-worst team in the Big Ten and the only favorable opponent left on Penn State\u2019s schedule. A loss would be catastrophic.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions went on to lose 76-72 as McMiller\u2019s 27-point, 11-rebound double-double wasn\u2019t enough.</p>\n                <p>However, Kieger got her girls together and sought an opportunity in West Lafayette, where they followed through. Penn State won in dramatic style in overtime, with an 85-82 victory over the Boilermakers, which finally ended the losing skid.</p>\n                <p>Penn State went into the break with a 36-34 lead, and the prize was there for the taking. But, from the product displayed thus far, the Lady Lions have proven not to be a second-half team.</p>\n                <p>Yet, it was the three-point and field goal shooting that gave Penn State the edge as many players, including Moriah Murray, T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante and Gracie Merkle, came to the aid of McMiller. The unit played like a team.</p>\n                <p>With an impressive defensive performance, Penn State held Purdue to just 37% field goal shooting and 19% from deep.</p>\n                <p>It was a hard-fought victory that sparked momentum for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>No Merkle, no problem against MSU</p>\n                <p>Merkle was out of the lineup with a lower-body injury as she appeared in a boot on the sideline.</p>\n                <p>Without their 6-foot-6 center, the Lady Lions have proved to be a mess. But Merkle\u2019s absence was the exact spark needed to keep Penn State in the game.</p>\n                <p>Merkle's vast presence was never going to be filled with a solo performance. While McMiller exploded, the team came together as a whole and nearly notched out its second-straight win days after an impressive victory over the Boilermakers.</p>\n                <p>Once more, it was the shooting and defensive prowess that gave way to an early Penn State lead. At halftime, the Lady Lions led 45-33.</p>\n                <p>While they ultimately fell in the second half, the signs of improvement were clear. Against one of the nation\u2019s best, Penn State stood its ground with a generally positive overall performance.</p>\n                <p>Despite Merkle\u2019s absence, Penn State answered the call and nearly left a voicemail for the Spartans to take home.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Before there was language, there was music.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s become a form of history, featuring stories of endless resistance, great love, immense toil or well-deserved triumph.</p>\n                <p>The evolution of music to its modern form was not sparked out of thin air. From Frank Sinatra to The Beatles to Taylor Swift, the core aspects of contemporary music can be traced back to Black artists who pioneered the industry.</p>\n                <p>Arreon Harley-Emerson, assistant professor of choral music, is well-versed in the customs and sounds of the Black diaspora. He said modern music does not exist without Black culture.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel very strongly that in order to study American music, whether it\u2019s classical or contemporary music, that you really have to take a look at a lot of these early Black and African musicians,\u201d Harley-Emerson said. \u201cThey had just so many contributions, from classical music to jazz, to gospel, to hip hop, to R&amp;B and we wouldn\u2019t have that quintessential American sound because Black musicians were very formative of that sound of American music.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Music historians often assert the construction of modern music began with spirituals sung in the fields during the period of enslavement in the U.S. As rhythms and techniques developed among Black musicians seeking solace, the sound stuck, building the foundation for gospel, jazz and blues that eventually evolved into pop, R&amp;B and hip hop.</p>\n                <p>Gospel music placed the seed for rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to emerge with its sentimental appeal, syncopated beats and use of audience participation, inspiring widely popular musicians such as Elvis Presley, who grew up surrounded by Black musicians.</p>\n                <p>Artists, like Presley, reach metaphorical \u201cking\u201d status without the average listener understanding exactly where they got their roots. Even the way Presley chose to carry himself on stage was inspired by observing Black churches in his Tennessee hometown.</p>\n                <p>Before Presley, there was Chuck Berry and Little Richard. Before The Rolling Stones, there was W.C. Handy and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.</p>\n                <p>Studying the figures behind the development of music creates a window into Black history as a whole, as Harley-Emerson noted.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn fashion, music and art, Black Americans have always been what I like to say, \u2018pace setters,\u2019\u201d Harley-Emerson said. \u201cYou cannot be steeped in Black history and not also learn about these Black figures because they\u2019re just so consequential, and so I think even knowing how music developed is important, American music more specifically.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Several features of the industry itself were also born from the innovations of Black artists.</p>\n                <p>Joshua Mallard, a music composition lecturer at Penn State, is deeply invested in the world of music and said he sees the shadow of Black artists in music across the board.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think of sampling, remix and DJ culture as a whole,\u201d Mallard said. \u201cThere are trap-style drums that you hear pretty much everywhere now, whether it\u2019s Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish or other artists at the top of pop. They are using hip hop influenced sounds and samples, so I think there is a huge technical contribution there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>From leading movements of resistance to setting the standard for being given royalties for sheet music, there are Black trailblazers who took the lead for all musicians to be fairly compensated for additions to the industry even if they weren\u2019t being justly recognized for their work due to racial prejudices.</p>\n                <p>Black artists are also often sidelined by the sampling, covering and appropriation of their work without being given the proper attribution or recognition by the artist, such as \u201cWhole Lotta Love\u201d being released by Led Zeppelin without giving a nod to the inspiration from Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters\u2019 \u201cYou Need Love.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Anisa Adkins has played and studied music all her life, even teaching it to elementary students to help them understand the importance of interacting with the diversity of sound around the world.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for white people to be engaged with Black culture on this level, but I don\u2019t think they should be claiming it as their own,\u201d Adkins, a second-year masters student studying music education, said. \u201cBut, we're not creating this and saying it\u2019s just for one group of people. Music is for everyone, it\u2019s just good to be acknowledged.\u201d</p>\n                <p>To best understand the music featured on the Billboard Hot 100 or to be able to conceptualize American history as a whole, it\u2019s important to know how musicians have been impacted by the innovation born from the creativity of Black Americans throughout time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it can be helpful to use music as a lens through which you see the world itself, because even though I\u2019m a music scholar, I understand world history through the lens of music,\u201d Mallard said. \u201cIf you are a Black or minority artist of any kind, just by making music, you are having an impact, a butterfly effect, on music history.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>For the second straight year, Penn State is on the outside looking in, with just three weeks left until the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions sit last in the conference with a 1-12 record, but have a better chance to pick up some wins in the coming games that could help them make a last-minute push.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look at a few different scenarios of how the blue and white could make the 2026 Big Ten Tournament.</p>\n                <p>2 wins</p>\n                <p>This is the most likely outcome, as the Lady Lions will still need twice as many wins in the next three weeks as they have over the past six weeks.</p>\n                <p>However, with that easier schedule approaching, it\u2019s certainly possible that Penn State could win a pair of games and see itself as the 15 seed.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have three games that have winning possibilities, including at home against Northwestern on Feb. 15, and on the road against Rutgers and Indiana later this year. In this scenario, Penn State only needs to win two of them.</p>\n                <p>However, given the fact that the current No. 15 seed is already two games ahead of Penn State, the Lady Lions need a lot to go right to overtake the spot.</p>\n                <p>Penn State needs to leapfrog No. 17-seed Rutgers, which can only win once against Purdue, Indiana or two mid-tier teams. Each with three wins, either Purdue or Indiana must lose each of their remaining games of the year, while Northwestern \u2014 if Penn State wins \u2014 could win one more game.</p>\n                <p>3 wins</p>\n                <p>While three wins are much harder, it is still doable for the Lady Lions, as alluded to in the previous section.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has three \u201ceasier\u201d opponents left in its schedule, and while a pair of them are on the road, it\u2019s not 100% out of the question for these wins.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions are favored against both Northwestern and Rutgers, and while they\u2019re only given a 16.9% chance to win against the Hoosiers, coach Carolyn Kieger may know the key to breaking former Penn Stater Shay Ciezki\u2019s success.</p>\n                <p>By winning three games, Penn State would still be competing for the 14th and 15th seeds, but would have slightly more flexibility in terms of opponents winning.</p>\n                <p>If the wins come against Indiana, Northwestern and Rutgers, the Hoosiers and Wildcats could each earn another win this year, and Rutgers could earn two.</p>\n                <p>4 wins</p>\n                <p>The most unlikely scenario comes with the Lady Lions earning four wins as they have less than a six-percent chance to beat either Maryland or USC.</p>\n                <p>However, with another win, the blue and white would be in contention for the No. 12-15 seed, giving it an easier matchup in the first round of the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions would need both Nebraska and Wisconsin to lose the rest of their games this year, while Indiana and Purdue could win two games and Northwestern and Purdue three games.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Over the Nittany Lions\u2019 last 32 games against power-conference opponents, the team is 5-27.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said Penn State has a \u201cnot great\u201d basketball tradition, saying he knew how hard the job of building a program would be when he was hired.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a very good staff,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe just got to continue to try to find ways to make our program better and build it so we could find a way to fight in this landscape, and that's important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For those wondering, Rhoades\u2019 buyout sits at $9 million this season, and it drops to $6 million in the 2026-27 season. It goes down further to $3 million in 2027-28 and $1.5 million in 2028-29.</p>\n                <p>West Coast travel</p>\n                <p>Penn State is out west this week with road games against Washington and Oregon. Up first is the Huskies with tipoff set for 10:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>The team arrived in Washington on Monday after flying out of State College Regional Airport and refueling in Bismarck, North Dakota.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGuys handle it well,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe got in the gym last night and got some work in, a lot of shots up, got some work in and preparing for Washington.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s the second time the Nittany Lions have had to fly to the West Coast since the Big Ten added USC, UCLA, Oregon and Washington to the conference. Last season, the team traveled to face the Trojans and the Bruins on the road, and it lost both games.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has another practice on Tuesday before its gameday against the Huskies. Rhoades said if this long-distance travel is made a \u201cbig deal,\u201d it becomes a \u201cbig deal.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI've always felt that way,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI've rode on buses for six, eight, 10 hours to go play. I've driven the white vans for six, eight, 10 hours to go play. So we're flying across the country to go play a Big Ten game. It's how you approach it, so you'll never get in a complaint or an excuse.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ivan Juri\u0107\u2019s return</p>\n                <p>Freshman 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107 made his return from a two-game absence due to illness during Sunday\u2019s matchup with USC. Rhoades said he thought Juri\u0107 was \u201cgreat\u201d in his first game back.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was really impressed how much he played, and how he played because I thought he'd be coughing up a lung a couple times throughout the game and really zap his energy,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cHe's a tough dude, man, and I thought he played very well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 totaled 13 points, eight rebounds and three steals with 4-of-9 shooting from the field and 1-of-3 shooting from 3-point range. The big man was a team-high +7 in his 26 minutes on the floor during the 77-75 loss.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 said postgame that he was still dealing with discomfort in his lungs. He\u2019s since had two more days to recover and has one more day until tipoff against Washington.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe felt a lot better yesterday when we got on the plane, and he looked pretty good yesterday, moving around in the arena,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSo hopefully he's feeling better and better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Other injury updates</p>\n                <p>Rhoades gave updates on wing Eli Rice, forward Tibor Mirti\u010d and forward Sa\u0161a Ciani as well. Notably, Rhoades said Rice is set to make a return against Washington.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEli will be good to go today (at practice),\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cHe'll be available to play this week.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rice exited the Minnesota game on Feb. 1 after hitting his head against an opposing player, and he hasn\u2019t played since. He participated in pregame warmups before the USC game even though he was listed as \u201cout\u201d on the availability report.</p>\n                <p>As for Mirti\u010d and Ciani, Rhoades said both are \u201cday to day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mirti\u010d first endured a knee injury during the Michigan game on Jan. 6. During his first practice back, he injured his shoulder, causing him to wear a sling on his left arm. He was first spotted in that sling during the Northwestern game on Jan. 29, but he was no longer wearing it last Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Ciani hasn\u2019t played since the Ohio State game on Jan. 26 with an ankle injury.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Grace Levy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After spending over four months in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, Subramanyam \u201cSubu\u201d Vedam\u2019s deportation order was vacated by the Justice Department\u2019s Board of Immigration Appeals on Feb. 3.</p>\n                <p>Vedam\u2019s initial deportation order was based on his 1988 murder conviction. However, after the charge was vacated in October 2025, the order was reopened related to a conviction regarding controlled substances. In 1984, Vedam was convicted of selling LSD in State College.</p>\n                <p>In October 2025, Vedam\u2019s lawyers argued for his immigration case to be reopened based on his exoneration and good behavior while in prison for 44 years.</p>\n                <p>While Temporary Appellate Immigration Judge Paul A. McCloskey acknowledged in court documents that the motion was untimely, being filed nearly 25 years beyond the 90-day deadline to reopen final administrative orders of removal, he also acknowledged the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d around the case.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGiven the facts and circumstances in this particular case, we conclude that the record before us presents an exceptional situation that warrants the exercise of our sua sponte reopening authority,\u201d McCloskey wrote in the ruling.</p>\n                <p>This ruling allows a new hearing for Vedam and restores his permanent U.S. resident status.</p>\n                <p>Vedam was convicted with first-degree murder following the 1980 disappearance of his roommate Thomas Kinser in Centre County. Kinser\u2019s body was found in nearby Harris Township in September 1981 with what was determined to be a .25 caliber bullet hole in his skull.</p>\n                <p>Vedam\u2019s legal team appealed his conviction, saying that Vedam had not purchased the .25 caliber gun that was used to convict him until after the murder had taken place. Vedam was retried in 1988, but convicted of first-degree murder again.</p>\n                <p>Vedam spent over 40 years in a Centre County prison following this conviction, with good behavior. In 2023, the Centre County district attorney found previously hidden evidence, allowing Vedam\u2019s legal team to appeal for another trial. The evidence left out included forensic analysis from the 1988 trial showing that a .22 caliber bullet was used instead of a .25 caliber bullet.</p>\n                <p>His conviction was revisited in early 2025 under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), where Judge Jonathan Grine ruled that not all evidence was presented in the 1988 trial, in violation of Vedam\u2019s 6th Amendment right to due process.</p>\n                <p>Vedam\u2019s murder conviction was then vacated in August 2025 and a new trial had been granted.</p>\n                <p>On Oct. 2, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna announced that the charges against Vedam would be dismissed. Vedam was 19 at the time of his conviction, and was exonerated at age 64.</p>\n                <p>A day later it was announced Vedam had been taken into ICE custody. Vedam legally immigrated to the U.S. as a baby from India, growing up in State College as his father taught at Penn State. Vedam was held at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, just outside Centre County.</p>\n                <p>In November, two judges temporarily blocked Vedam\u2019s deportation proceedings, with his lawyers filing a motion to reopen his immigration case through the Board of Immigration Appeals.</p>\n                <p>MORE CRIME AND COURTS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Last weekend, No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey completed its final road trip of the regular season with a series against AHA opponent Lindenwood.</p>\n                <p>In this battle of the Lions, the ones reigning from State College came out victorious.</p>\n                <p>With a 6-3 win on Friday and a 5-0 win on Saturday, the Nittany Lions completed a season sweep over Lindenwood and outscored them 22-4 in the process.</p>\n                <p>AHA record</p>\n                <p>With a win on Friday, coach Jeff Kampersal led Penn State to its 20th conference win of the season, a new record.</p>\n                <p>Kampersal made AHA history just last season when Penn State finished 19-1 in conference play.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions head coach improved that record to 21 conference wins on Saturday with the completion of the sweep, and has a chance to set the new record at 23 with one last set of conference games to play against RIT this weekend.</p>\n                <p>Game-winning Grace</p>\n                <p>Grace Outwater scored the first goal in Penn State\u2019s shutout on Saturday, doubling it as the game-winning goal, as well. Outwater now has six game-winning goals this season, which puts her in a tie for the most in the nation with teammate Katelyn Roberts and six other skaters.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore winger also tied the game in Friday\u2019s contest just 23 seconds after Lindenwood took a rare 1-0 lead over the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>With goals in both games, Outwater has now scored a goal in each of her last nine games played and has recorded 13 points over that span. Her active streak of nine games is second in the nation to Minnesota\u2019s Abbey Murphy, who scored in each of her last 10 games before heading to Italy to represent the United States in the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>Outwater increased her season scoring total to 23 goals, which is good enough for the most in the AHA and fifth in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Double-digit Desa</p>\n                <p>Penn State goaltender Katie DeSa blanked the Lions in a 5-0 shutout on Saturday, her 10th of the season.</p>\n                <p>DeSa\u2019s 10 shutouts are a new program record for the most shutouts in a single season, and are the most shutouts in the nation this campaign.</p>\n                <p>The senior goalie also made 34 saves on Friday against Lindenwood, the second most she has made in a single game this season.</p>\n                <p>DeSa finished the weekend 2-0 with a .952 save percentage and a 1.50 goals-against-average.</p>\n                <p>With three goals allowed over the two games played last weekend, Penn State statistically has the best defense in the nation.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white as a team have allowed 42 goals in 32 games played this season, an average of 1.31 goals allowed per game, the lowest across the NCAA.</p>\n                <p>Lions on the board</p>\n                <p>With three forwards out due to the Winter Olympics, the Nittany Lions have been skating with a somewhat depleted roster that still contains three defensive pairings, but only three lines of forwards.</p>\n                <p>However, that has allowed for more players to receive more ice time than what\u2019s customary. With more ice time, more players have a chance to earn their way onto the scoring sheet. That\u2019s exactly what Penn State did last weekend.</p>\n                <p>Of the 15 skaters that hit the ice, 14 of them, as well as DeSa, recorded at least one point against Lindenwood. DeSa recorded an assist on Mikah Keller\u2019s second-period goal on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Leading the total scoring over the weekend for the blue and white was Danica Maynard, who finished with four points.

    "description": "<p>After earning its first conference win of the season last week against Purdue, Penn State fell back to its losing habits on Saturday as it lost to Michigan State.</p>\n                <p>Despite these season-long struggles, coach Carolyn Kieger and her squad remain optimistic and keep pushing forward, as she detailed in her weekly media session on Tuesday.</p>\n                <p>Last week's success</p>\n                <p>Penn State was the underdog heading into its matchup with the Boilermakers last Wednesday, losing 11 straight contests.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, the return of Gracie Merkle and the continued success of Kiyomi McMiller lifted the blue and white out of the losing column for the first time since Dec. 20.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we learned a lot from that game,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe did a really good job executing, and I thought we did a really good job sharing the basketball.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Against Purdue, McMiller scored 30 points, which was then topped by a 37-point performance against Michigan State.</p>\n                <p>While the Lady Lions ultimately gave away a double-digit lead and lost by 11 points, Kieger said the first-half toughness was a sign of improvement from earlier this year.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat fourth quarter slipped away from us, but I thought they did a great job, both executing and playing, with each other on the defensive end,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cThat team synergy is continuing to grow, and we just got to keep making sure we\u2019re playing team basketball, because that\u2019s when we\u2019re at our best.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Maryland matchup</p>\n                <p>The first game in Penn State\u2019s path to the Big Ten tournament is Maryland, which has had a back-and-forth season this year.</p>\n                <p>After losing out on Merkle in the transfer portal, the Terrapins picked up Yarden Garzon. The former Hoosier has been dominant this year, scoring 13.0 points per game with 69 made 3-pointers.</p>\n                <p>Alongside Garzon has been Oluchi Okananwa, who\u2019s the 10th highest scorer in the Big Ten with 17.2 points per game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOluchi is just a phenomenal talent,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cThe thing that worries me the most about her is her offensive rebounding ability and her athleticism. She never gives up on a play.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Following successful bouts against Purdue and Michigan State, the Lady Lions look to carry that momentum into Thursday\u2019s matchup with Maryland.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMaryland is very similar to Michigan State, where they have a couple elite shooters,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build on what we did at Purdue, and we\u2019re going to build upon the game that we played against Michigan State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Moving forward</p>\n                <p>With three weeks until the Big Ten tournament, Penn State needs to start winning. However, it\u2019s been missing a key piece to its squad over the past few weeks in Merkle, who returned to the bench on Saturday in a boot.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see her again this season,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of coming back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Alongside the Lady Lions\u2019 struggles, the men\u2019s basketball team has just one conference win, with fans calling for action for both squads.</p>\n                <p>Despite criticism, both teams have supported each other this year and remain each other\u2019s top supporters, according to Kieger.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe all support each other and lean on each other for words of encouragement or that kind of stuff,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe\u2019re all one team. We share the gym, we share the training room, and we share the weight room. We\u2019re rooting for each other a ton.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Part of that rooting comes in the Lady Lions\u2019 upcoming schedule, where they need at least two wins to clinch the Big Ten tournament. Even with a challenging year, the team continues to push toward that goal.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe biggest thing that we just keep trying to do every day is get better and stack days,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cGet better at practice, get better as a team, get better as coaches. We build confidence, chemistry and just keep stacking winning habits.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Brennan Kramp I For the Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s South Asian Student Association (SASA) held a Q-and-A event with actor Karan Brar on Monday night at Freeman Auditorium in the HUB-Robeson Center.</p>\n                <p>Brar is best known for his work as a child actor, starring in roles such as Ravi Ross in the Disney Channel TV shows, \u201cJessie\u201d and \u201cBUNK\u2019D.\u201d He also played Chirag Gupta in the \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid\u201d movie series. At 27 years old, Brar is credited in more than 40 film and television projects, spanning over a decade and a half.</p>\n                <p>At 5:30 p.m., students lined down the hall of the HUB, waiting for the doors of Freeman Auditorium to open for their chance to see the actor. Inside, a playlist of 2010\u2019s music played, intermixing with the sounds of students packing close together, sharing conversation and smiles before Brar was introduced to a rowdy ovation from the crowd.</p>\n                <p>The Q-and-A was meant to give Brar a chance to open up about a range of topics from mental health, sexual identity, acting and the ability to connect with students of South Asian descent on what it means to be a minority in such a high profile field. During the conversation, Brar took questions from students in the crowd about anything from advice to his favorite episode of \u201cJessie.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Arush Tiwari, the cultural events director for SASA, said he had seen Brar on television as a child, and was glad to see the actor speak live.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought it was awesome,\u201d Tiwari, a second-year studying finance and pre-dentistry said. \u201cJust to see South Asian representation through a form of such a big star that most of us have grown up with, it was absolutely incredible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Finding a celebrity of any status can be a difficult task, especially one willing to come and speak at an event. Brar filled the room with laughter and found multiple ways of deeply connecting with students in the crowd as he spoke on various topics.</p>\n                <p>Sonya Shetty said she appreciated the way Brar spoke about his mental health journey growing up as a minority child actor, his experience coming out as bisexual and how that impacted his professional and social life and finding ways to embrace your situation given the circumstances.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was really nice seeing a person-of-color (POC) actor being very open with conversations on mental health and being queer\u2026it was really enlightening seeing him be so open about it,\u201d Shetty, a second-year veterinary and biomedical sciences student said.</p>\n                <p>Another major point that connected Brar with the attendees was his non-traditional upbringing given the traditional South Asian household dynamic. Students like Katelynn Jassal found that Brar, finding his way into Hollywood as a child actor and not being brought up on an academic based standard, was a comforting and interesting conversation.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNot having as strict of parents or going down an untraditional path, career wise, through acting\u2026that was really nice to see that he was able to be successful and not do something the stereotypical way,\u201d Jassal, a third-year studying international politics said.</p>\n                <p>The conversation wrapped up with Brar and the rest of the SASA taking a group photo and signing autographs and banners featuring a young Brar in character as Ravi.</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Back when I toured Penn State in high school, the thing that stood out to me the most was the school spirit.</p>\n                <p>I had only visited one other university beforehand, but the difference was striking.</p>\n                <p>Almost every student I passed in State College had on some sort of Penn State gear, whether it was a branded hat in the winter cold or a simple blue and white outfit.</p>\n                <p>This spoke to me deeply. Not only was this a beautiful campus with a top-tier educational system, but the attendees were so passionate about it. I knew Penn State must be doing something right.</p>\n                <p>Clothes here serve as a cultural integrator. We are a part of something bigger than ourselves and we are proud of that fact, of the hard work it took to get into Penn State and excel here.</p>\n                <p>In an age of institutional distrust, albeit much of it warranted, it\u2019s increasingly meaningful to be engaged with an establishment that still commands our respect and our loyalty.</p>\n                <p>Our choice of education has stood the test of time, and our choice of attire reflects this impressive fact.</p>\n                <p>And you see this sentiment all over State College. Ninety percent of all of my T\u2013shirts are Penn State related, and I\u2019d bet at least half of yours are too.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s so beautiful not just to see this appreciation in State College, but truly all over the world.</p>\n                <p>I was once traveling in Israel \u2014 almost 6,000 miles away from PA \u2014 wearing my finest blue and white, when a Penn State alum, also dressed in his spirited gear, said \u201cWe Are\u201d to me.</p>\n                <p>What were the chances that both of us Penn Staters would be in the same place at the same time and both wearing Nittany Lion merchandise?</p>\n                <p>We struck up a lovely conversation just by virtue of going to the same university, and I\u2019ve had many such interactions, albeit usually a little closer to home.</p>\n                <p>But even in the great state of Georgia, my home, Penn State alums are crawling all over the place. Just drop a mention of 16802 in an interview where the employee also went to Penn State, and you\u2019re practically guaranteed a call back.</p>\n                <p>But I digress.</p>\n                <p>Clothing is often seen as a statement. Something more meaningful than simple cloth that was closest at hand, and for good reason. Clothing is an expression of ourselves and our loyalties, of what\u2019s meaningful to us and has garnered our recognition.</p>\n                <p>Penn State gear is a sign of belonging, voluntary conformity and traditional symbology.</p>\n                <p>No one is monitoring our clothing choices, yet day after day, and year after year, you see the same pattern.</p>\n                <p>We choose to represent our school because of the great experiences we\u2019ve had here, the great community we\u2019ve cultivated and the desire to share that with passersby. We choose to represent our school because of the meaning it has in our hearts and minds.</p>\n                <p>And we\u2019ve been doing this since 1890. That\u2019s 136 years of blue and white and we\u2019re still going strong.</p>\n                <p>Students love vintage gear, and for a greater reason than old stuff just looks cool. It\u2019s a reminder of our storied history and legacy. And when passed down from a parent or older sibling, it becomes even more special. You become an integral link in the great chain of generations of Penn Staters.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s merchandise brings a whole new meaning to \u201cWe Are.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Anisa Daniel-Oniko | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Over the past few years, campus protests have swept through colleges across the United States, sometimes followed by crackdowns on free speech.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what students need to know about free speech at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Federal/State Law</p>\n                <p>The First Amendment</p>\n                <p>According to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d</p>\n                <p>However, the First Amendment does not give all speech equal protections. Federally unprotected categories of speech include incitement to imminent lawless action, true threats, obscenity, defamation, harassment and material and substantial disruption.</p>\n                <p>Incitement to imminent lawless action must be targeted at a specific person or group of people. There must also be evidence or \u201crational inference\u201d that the language was \u201cintended to produce, and likely to produce, imminent disorder.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While there is no explicit list, fighting words are generally understood to be words which \u201cinflict injury and tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u201d Fighting words are examined in totality, contextually, so \u201cspeech can still be protected if it is angry or profane.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A true threat is spoken with the intention of \u201cplacing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Obscenity has proven difficult to legally define, but the typical test used was established in Miller v. California. If speech appears to be of an abnormal, morbid or unhealthy interest in sex, and is patently offensive with no literary, artistic, political or scientific value, it\u2019s considered obscene and not protected by the first amendment.</p>\n                <p>Intentionally false assertions of fact that are publicly shared and cause injury are considered defamatory and not protected by the First Amendment. Statements can be written (libel) or spoken (slander) and must be capable of being proven false in order to count as defamation.</p>\n                <p>Harassment is unwelcome behavior based on an individual\u2019s (perceived) protected status. It must be \u201csevere, persistent, and pervasive\u201d enough to \u201cunreasonably interfere with that individual\u2019s educational (or employment) environment.\u201d</p>\n                <p>If speech \u201ccreates or threatens to create\u201d tangible and substantial disruption to a school\u2019s functioning, it is unprotected speech.</p>\n                <p>The Constitution of Pennsylvania, Section 7</p>\n                <p>Pennsylvania\u2019s constitution describes \u201cthe free communication of thoughts and opinions\u201d as being \u201cone of the invaluable rights of man.\u201d All citizens are allowed to \u201cfreely speak, write and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State Policy</p>\n                <p>Penn State extends the same protections to student speech, discussions, writings and ideas as the First Amendment.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s policy AD51 Use of Outdoor Areas for Expressive Activities gives students the ability to protest on campus, encourages expression and outlines locations suitable for demonstrations. These locations include Old Main front patio, Willard Building grounds (area between Willard and the obselik) and the Allen Street Gaze Plaza.

The university also prohibits the erection of structures or affixing of posters, and does not allow sound amplification before 8 a.m. and after 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>The time, place and manner restrictions take into account environmental, health and safety concerns, potential damage to facilities, direct and indirect costs of the school, appropriateness and overall impact of the event.</p>\n                <p>Free Speech at Penn State</p>\n                <p>Penn State students routinely engage in protests, vigils and demonstrations on campus. Recently, students protested against the Iranian regime, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations and the Trump Administration.</p>\n                <p>Even contentious events, such as President Trump\u2019s 2024 Rally in the Bryce Jordan Center or pro-Palestine gatherings, are typically protected by Penn State\u2019s policy. However, Policy AD51 violations and controversies have led to event alterations in the past.</p>\n                <p>For example, the Penn State chapter of Turning Point USA hosted Charlie Kirk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/news/campus/there-s-no-balance-charlie-kirk-brings-you-re-being-brainwashed-tour-to-penn-state/article_5d053450-76ed-11ef-834f-37264f33a103.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"You're Being Brainwashed Tour\u201d in 2024</a>. A week before, the Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity (SCDS) released an online petition to deny Kirk access to campus, which garnered more than 200 signatures.</p>\n                <p>On the day of the event, students showed up with placards to protest the presence of the Turning Point founder and conservative political activist. Ultimately, the university did not allow Kirk to deliver his planned speech or debates due to sound amplification violations.</p>\n                <p>Similarly, Penn State students gathered to protest a scheduled Uncensored America event featuring Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and comedian Alex Stein in 2022.</p>\n                <p>The university eventually canceled the event, calling the views of both speakers \u201cabhorrent\u201d and citing safety concerns.</p>\n                <p>Free Speech at Private Universities</p>\n                <p>In 2025, Columbia University disciplined students for engaging in a pro-Palestinian demonstration by revoking degrees, expelling some protestors and suspending others for up to three years.</p>\n                <p>Penn State students have also demonstrated in support of Palestine, but no similar result has occurred at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Crucially, this difference is due to Penn State\u2019s public university status.

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State hits the road to the West Coast for the first time all year with a two-game road trip, despite the chance of jet lag. It presents the Nittany Lions an opportunity to gain some momentum to finish out a weak season.</p>\n                <p>While on the coast, the blue and white travel to two bottom-half Big Ten squads in Washington and Oregon. Since their first game is in the Pacific Time Zone on Wednesday against the Huskies, there\u2019s a chance the time switch affects the blue and white\u2019s performance.</p>\n                <p>Let's glance at key storylines as Penn State steps into Alaska Airlines Arena for the first time ever and only the second time ever, after the Huskies defeated Mike Rhoades\u2019 unit in the inaugural meeting between the two last season.</p>\n                <p>Avalanche of absences</p>\n                <p>As the teams begin to warm to the idea of playing each other in Big Ten play, they\u2019re also getting used to playing without their full squad.</p>\n                <p>Washington listed four as out in its last game, a 77-73 loss to UCLA, its ninth conference loss of the season, with only four wins \u2014 all against bottom-half Big Ten teams.</p>\n                <p>Penn State endured a similar fate, in its 12th conference loss of the season on Sunday at the hands of a USC buzzer-beater. The Nittany Lions played without three: Tibor Mirti\u0107, Sas\u01ce Ciani and sharpshooter Eli Rice.</p>\n                <p>Both squads will look within their ranks to fill those absences, although they're limited in returning personnel from last year\u2019s contest. Washington\u2019s Zoom Diallo is the only starter from 2025 to return for this year.</p>\n                <p>For the blue and white, its leading scorer this year, Freddie Dilione V, returns with some familiarity with the Huskies, having scored 15 points in last year\u2019s clash.</p>\n                <p>Dominick Stewart joins Dilione, with a much larger role this season than last. He appeared in only four minutes against Washington, but has been thrust into the starting unit at times this season.</p>\n                <p>Stars and stats</p>\n                <p>Despite limited familiarity with the contest, a few names emerge as worth watching. Diallo made a significant sophomore jump for Washington, scoring while leading his squad in assists, and has been a strong second star alongside one of the best freshmen in the country, Hannes Steinbach.</p>\n                <p>The W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, native is a walking double-double, averaging over 17 points per game and rebounding figures that lead the Big Ten on both the offensive and defensive ends.</p>\n                <p>Washington built a solid core around the pair, as Franck Kepnang anchors the paint with 2.3 blocks per game, tied as the second-best average in the conference.</p>\n                <p>As a unit, the Huskies lead their effort with an extremely physical approach \u2014 the Nittany Lions actually edge out Washington\u2019s shooting figures. The Huskies stand out in the conference with their top-three block and rebounding figures, and also post top-half foul, defense and steal metrics.</p>\n                <p>KenPom ranks Washington just inside the top 50, with its offense and defense just inside the top 60. The Nittany Lions sit outside at No. 130, as both their offense and defense showed struggles. The defense ranks among the worst in college basketball, 253 of 365, while the blue and white offense sits just in the mid-70s.</p>\n                <p>Statistician Evan Miyakawa\u2019s formulas mirror those of KenPoms, though it puts the Nittany Lions as a Big Ten team with a top-five conference tempo, and surprisingly not that it matters in this one, the blue and white have the best home ranking in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Washington, on the other hand, is in the bottom five in that same category. Its home venue, which seats around 10,000, reached only 90% capacity this season, when top contender Michigan visited. The rest of the Huskies home games sit around 5,000-7,000 in the stands.</p>\n                <p>For this midweek contest, it looks to be on the lower side, with tickets under $10 on the Monday before tipoff.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Kayla Treanor\u2019s first season in Happy Valley is off to a hot start after a 1-0 opening weekend.</p>\n                <p>Next up on the docket is the team\u2019s season opener against UMass at noon on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>The Minutewomen are also 1-0 to start the year, with a big win over Holy Cross last weekend. With Wednesday\u2019s matchup rapidly approaching, here\u2019s a look at how the two teams will match up this week.</p>\n                <p>All-time contests</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions hold a 9-0 all-time record over UMass, spanning 48 years.</p>\n                <p>Penn State first played the Minutewomen in 1978, winning 9-3 in the 1978 USWLA Nationals. Two years later, the Nittany Lions won again, 8-3.</p>\n                <p>After the NCAA started sponsoring women\u2019s lacrosse in 1982, the blue and white were quick to the big stage, defeating UMass in a 7-6 overtime victory in the NCAA third-place game.</p>\n                <p>Over the next 30 years, the Nittany Lions continued to dominate the Minutewomen, winning another four games by an average of 7.75 goals.</p>\n                <p>2026 UMass</p>\n                <p>This year\u2019s UMass squad is off to a hot start after a dominant, 17-8 victory over Holy Cross.</p>\n                <p>The Minutewomen have been led by redshirt senior attacker Kassidy Morris, who led the team in scoring last season. On Friday, Morris tallied five goals in just seven shots, contributing significantly to the eight-point win.</p>\n                <p>Junior attacker Katie Peterson also put herself in a good position to start the year, scoring three goals as compared to the two goals she scored all season last year.</p>\n                <p>Peterson\u2019s success was also seen in draw controls, as she recorded nine in the game. As a whole, Holy Cross won just 13 draw controls.</p>\n                <p>On the defensive end of the ball, the Minutewomen put up a dominant performance with 15 caused turnovers, which would\u2019ve been good enough to beat the second-best average caused turnovers per game in the NCAA last year.</p>\n                <p>Wednesday\u2019s matchup</p>\n                <p>While both teams are coming off their first wins of the season over the weekend, Penn State\u2019s matchup showed slightly more grit and toughness.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions defeated Richmond in a one-goal nail-biter \u2014 a team that just missed out on the NCAA tournament last year. Along the same lines, UMass made it to the first round but fell to Princeton, 19-10.</p>\n                <p>However, both squads have strong goalkeepers who will make it tough to put any points on the board on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State, Sydney Manning is starting in net for her third straight season. Against the Spiders, she recorded a 43.8% save percentage as her squad pulled out the win on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Lining up across from Manning, however, is freshman Caitlyn Naughton. In her first collegiate game, Naughton recorded a 52.9% save percentage.</p>\n                <p>While Holy Cross struggled to score on Naughton, the Nittany Lions have several deadly attackers who could add to the stat sheet.</p>\n                <p>Payton Wainman tied her career-high in goals scored on Saturday as she put four in the back of the net. Alongside Wainman, four-star freshman Rocquette Allen earned her first career start and tallied two goals.</p>\n                <p>Between Saturday\u2019s dynamic duo and Erika Ho \u2014 last year\u2019s leading scorer \u2014 the blue and white have some strong attackers who could make Naughton work this week.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State opened the Kayla Treanor era with its first win on Saturday, taking down Richmond 10-9.</p>\n                <p>Throughout the 60 minutes of action, the Nittany Lions had several standout moments and players who can help define Treanor\u2019s first year in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Freshmen expectations</p>\n                <p>Treanor didn\u2019t shy away from the younger athletes when selecting her starting lineup against Richmond. Taking the starting lineup on Saturday were four-star attacker Rocquette Allen and defender Susannah O\u2019Connell.</p>\n                <p>Allen\u2019s success was apparent right out of the gate, recording her first collegiate goal less than 15 minutes into action.</p>\n                <p>As the game progressed, so did the Lone Tree, Colorado, native\u2019s goal count. With a few minutes left in the third quarter, Allen scored her second goal of the game, becoming just one of Penn State's athletes on Saturday with multiple goals.</p>\n                <p>On the defensive end of the ball, O\u2019Connell had a slightly quieter game, forcing just two turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Wainman time</p>\n                <p>Less than 30 minutes into the action on Saturday, senior Payton Wainman recorded a hat trick, scoring three of Penn State\u2019s four goals that quarter.</p>\n                <p>Every time she was on the attack through the first two periods, it seemed like she found the net. The Delray Beach, Florida, native scored half the number of goals she scored all last year in just the opening game.</p>\n                <p>However, it wasn\u2019t just the number of goals Wainman scored that put her atop the statsheet.</p>\n                <p>Wainman only shot the ball six times, recording a 66.7% shooting percentage. On top of that, she picked up three ground balls, the most of anyone on Penn State besides the goalkeeper.</p>\n                <p>Offensive attack</p>\n                <p>While Wainman found the net four times and Allen twice, four other athletes scored in Penn State\u2019s win on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Kelly MacKinney, Erika Ho, Emma Kelly and Anna Salerno each scored against Richmond, kicking off their seasons on a positive note.</p>\n                <p>As a whole, the Nittany Lions were aggressive on the offensive front, recording 24 shots against the Spiders. Of those 24, only five weren\u2019t on goal.</p>\n                <p>In addition to Wainman\u2019s high shooting percentage, both Ho and MacKinney went 1-for-1 on the attack, while Kelly, Alen and Salerno had multiple attempts before striking gold.</p>\n                <p>While they weren\u2019t victorious, Delaney Radin and Elizabeth Ann\u00e9 combined for four shots, adding to the offensive attack from the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

Sitting in the HUB will give you plenty of opportunities to strike up a conversation and bond over all the people around you.</p>\n                <p>The HUB is also the perfect place to flirt because everyone is pretending to be busy.</p>\n                <p>You can easily sit across from someone for hours and only make eye contact exactly twice, but you can still consider it romantic.</p>\n                <p>BEST: Beaver Stadium during a football game</p>\n                <p>Beaver Stadium during a football game is a great place to meet your special someone because you already know they\u2019re loyal.</p>\n                <p>After a season filled with overtime disappointments and failing to win in the big moments, anyone who is still showing up to the games clearly believes in commitment.</p>\n                <p>Bonding over that one Drew Allar interception during the White Out this season will build a strong and ever-lasting relationship.</p>\n                <p>If you can survive the heartache Penn State football brings, then you guys can truly survive any obstacle that is thrown your way.</p>\n                <p>BEST: The Daily Collegian table in Willard Building</p>\n                <p>The Daily Collegian table in Willard is obviously filled with the best and funniest people in the world.</p>\n                <p>Everyone there is extremely attractive, intelligent and humble, which makes it the ideal place to meet your special someone.</p>\n                <p>If you meet someone sitting at the Collegian table, chances are they have a great sense of humor and a deep appreciation for satire.

It is a place where it always feels like you\u2019re doing something wrong.</p>\n                <p>WORST: Canvas Discussion Boards</p>\n                <p>Meeting your special someone through a Canvas discussion is definitely not romantic.</p>\n                <p>You might think what they said was really smart, but they probably wrote a paragraph about something they didn't even read.</p>\n                <p>If you somehow think you\u2019ve found the one through their discussion post, you will have a relationship based on a love for shared procrastination \u2014 which isn\u2019t the strongest foundation.</p>\n                <p>At the end of the day, love can happen anywhere at Penn State \u2026 or not at all.

Nonetheless, the blue and white return to Happy Valley with many positives from opening weekend.</p>\n                <p>Nemeth\u2019s return</p>\n                <p>One of the most highly anticipated moments of the weekend was junior pitcher Bridget Nemeth's return after missing the 2025 season. The 6-foot-1 right-hander appeared in four of Penn State\u2019s games and pitched a team-high nine innings.</p>\n                <p>Nemeth appeared in both Friday contests, coming in relief to earn the win against Missouri, while getting the starting nod versus Boston College. In the two games combined, the Glendora, California, native pitched 5.1 innings, allowing one hit and striking out three batters.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Nemeth pitched 2.2 innings against BYU, allowing four hits and recording three strikeouts. The junior worked one inning against Auburn, giving up two hits and tossing two strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Nemeth completed the opening weekend with a 1.56 ERA and managed to allow just one walk.</p>\n                <p>Newcomers</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 weekend was highlighted by a few newcomers who made strong debuts in a Penn State uniform. It started with two freshmen coming up big in the blue and white\u2019s 7-4 win over Missouri.</p>\n                <p>Allison Oneacre and Kirsten Finarelli drove in all three of Penn State\u2019s runs in the top of the 10th inning. With one out and a runner on third, Finarelli doubled down the right field line to bring in the go-ahead run. Two batters later, Oneacre knocked a two-run home run for her first collegiate long ball.</p>\n                <p>Finarelli was the hero against BYU, hitting a walk-off single to defeat the Cougars 4-3. The Lehman, Pennsylvania, native also recorded her first career home run against Boston College.</p>\n                <p>Finarelli finished the weekend leading the Nittany Lions with a .368 batting average and seven hits, while Oneacre paced the blue and white with six RBIs.</p>\n                <p>The newest Penn Staters also made moves in the circle. Freshman Mackenzie Duncan and junior South Dakota transfer McKenna Young both had strong showings.</p>\n                <p>Young was the only pitcher to start multiple games, going 1-1 on the weekend. The Broadhead, Wisconsin, native pitched 8.1 innings, allowing six hits and tossing seven strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Duncan had arguably the best pitching performance of the weekend. The Winter Garden, Florida, native made two relief appearances and earned the win against Boston College.</p>\n                <p>In Duncan\u2019s two appearances, she threw seven innings, striking out 12 batters and allowing just five hits. The 5-foot-10 right-hander led the Nittany Lions with just one earned run allowed.</p>\n                <p>Pitching depth</p>\n                <p>Last season, Penn State was dominant at the plate but struggled in the circle. However, this wasn\u2019t the case in the Nittany Lions\u2019 opening weekend.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white exercised its new pitching depth, with five arms making an appearance, and sophomore Abigail Britton was the only one who was a part of the rotation a season ago.</p>\n                <p>In Penn State\u2019s combined 38.2 innings pitched, the staff allowed 28 hits, while tossing 42 strikeouts and finishing the weekend with a 1.63 ERA. The Nittany Lions allowed just 13 runs in their five games, nine of which were earned.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s pitching depth against strong competition proved to be the difference maker in its first weekend of the 2026 season.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | James Franklin\u2019s legacy as Black coach won\u2019t be lost in rocky end at Penn State",
    "author": "Avery Hill | Football Editor",
    "description": "<p>Entering the four-month mark since James Franklin was fired from Penn State, much of what\u2019s discussed among the Penn State fanbase is a sense of anger, disappointment and resentment.</p>\n                <p>At a shallow level, I get it. Twenty-one losses against AP top-10 teams, one Big Ten championship, a three-game losing streak to conclude his tenure coaching one of the biggest brands in college football. But what\u2019s often ignored is what he did do.</p>\n                <p>Among other successes, Franklin 's tenure at Penn State made him a modern-day pioneer in an area he holds near and dear to his heart \u2014 being a Black coach. That should never be forgotten.</p>\n                <p>At Penn State, Franklin won 104 games, a tie with Rip Engle as the second-most in program history. He also won four New Year\u2019s Six bowls and brought Penn State to a preseason ranking it hadn\u2019t seen since the late 1990s, an accomplishment even if it all unraveled after three games.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Franklin is the winningest African American head coach in FBS history. He\u2019s also the first and only African-American head coach to win a Big Ten title among other notable achievements.</p>\n                <p>But these accolades, and other on-field statistics only scratch the surface on what Franklin has done as a Black head coach.</p>\n                <p>The Langhorne, Pennsylvania, native long made it a goal of his to become the first Black head coach to win a national title. Of course to be able to do that on an individual level is important to Franklin, but the impact it may have on other coaches cements his legacy even more.</p>\n                <p>At the 2025 Orange Bowl media day, he noted the marker of 16 of 134 FBS coaches being Black \u2014 a number that has shifted a bit with 136 teams and the firing of coaches like Sherrone Moore.</p>\n                <p>It was a relative increase from the 6 of 127 FBS coaches when Franklin was the offensive coordinator at Kansas State under fellow Black head coach Ron Prince.</p>\n                <p>But that increase starts with coaches giving qualified minorities a chance. Franklin did so when he hired Charles Huff, who was on Franklin\u2019s staff at Vanderbilt but never landed a major, full-time position coaching job until he became Penn State\u2019s running backs coach in 2014. Huff went on to take three head coaching jobs.</p>\n                <p>Even for Huff\u2019s current stop, Memphis, Senior Vice President and Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Ed Scott said Franklin, along with Nick Saban, gave a firm recommendation for Huff.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat truly sets him apart is his character and integrity,\u201d Franklin said according to Memphis.</p>\n                <p>Then there\u2019s Terry Smith, who left a 2-10 Temple team where he coached the wide receivers, and was hired by Franklin as cornerbacks coach.</p>\n                <p>He may have never, and may never, get a shot to be a full-time head coach, but his time as an interim and his role as associate head coach made him one of the more respected, and highest-paid, assistants in the business.</p>\n                <p>That in its own right is an accomplishment in Black coaching history as according to a 2023 article from the Journal of Intercollegiate Sport, \u201cBlack coaches were disproportionately responsible for signing higher rated recruits than their White counterparts.\u201d Said responsibility comes from what\u2019s usually a position coach, a typically underpaid role.</p>\n                <p>And also with a look through the Lasch Building, the diversity, from all shapes of life and all positions, was evident; Franklin\u2019s a man who wants to give a chance to the most qualified.</p>\n                <p>But, that didn\u2019t mean it was all perfect.</p>\n                <p>As the big personality in Franklin fought a passionate, but critical fanbase, many seasons didn\u2019t go by without a \u201cFire Franklin!\u201d chant of some sorts.</p>\n                <p>Even in what I\u2019d consider a mishandling of his responsibilities as head man, walking off of the podium when asked for comment on the accusations of rape committed by his former players Jameial Lyons and Kaveion Keys, Franklin had his fair share of incidents that hurt his resume and perception.</p>\n                <p>But, said turn in perception, regardless of severity of the incident, is a microcosm of the fight Black coaches have fought for a long time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of us having to be perfect to get the job,\u201d legendary Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson Jr. said in 1998.</p>\n                <p>Black coaches have often been far behind the ladder when it comes to making the big step.</p>\n                <p>For Franklin, that started as a non-Division l collegiate player, and included a player/coach job in Denmark that he told Inside the Lions\u2019 Audrey Snyder he laid asphalt during.</p>\n                <p>It took Franklin 16 years to earn the big shot, though it\u2019s worth noting the sort of systematic privilege as a former quarterbacks coach that was promoted to offensive coordinator got him the opportunity even fast. He also got an 11-plus-year leash \u2014 a dream for many others.</p>\n                <p>But it didn\u2019t change his end at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The boos, curses and toxicity made Franklin a subject of pure resentment from a fanbase that, despite his successes, are likely rooted in a feeling of him not doing enough and not appreciating enough.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s a setback in his journey that, coincidentally, came in an NFL season that saw Mike Tomlin be fired and no Black coach be hired.</p>\n                <p>But it\u2019s also a message that Franklin, and many others, aren\u2019t done fighting. As Franklin makes a home in Blacksburg, Virginia, he continues to push for a fair shot for all.</p>\n                <p>But he isn\u2019t, and can\u2019t, start from ground zero. Despite the darkness \u2014 some to his fault and some to others\u2019 \u2014 created during his end in Happy Valley, Franklin\u2019s tenure is a marker for true success for a Black coach at the collegiate level.</p>\n                <p>It shouldn\u2019t be overshadowed.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Emma Naysmith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>One of THON\u2019s traditions is Dancer Mail Call, a designated surprise point of the weekend where every dancer is delivered mail from family, friends and the larger THON community.</p>\n                <p>THON is the world's largest student-run philanthropy that aims to provide emotional and financial support to Four Diamonds families who have been impacted by childhood cancer.</p>\n                <p>According to Dancer Relations Mail Call Captain Clayton Roynan, this tradition began in 1990 with Mike \u201cthe Mailman\u201d Herr, who has become a returning figure during mail delivery.</p>\n                <p>\"We're nearly 40 years into the tradition, and it really just started off where he would hand out some letters and packages to the dancers,\u201d Roynan, a third-year studying accounting and finance, said. \u201cSince then, it's become a much more upscale thing where there's an address specifically for mail.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dancer Mail has a deadline of February 11 and can be brought to a letter dropbox outside of 215 Johnston Commons Building or mailed with a postmark by then to be delivered THON Weekend.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s also the option for the public to scan and upload letters online to be printed for delivery. For questions and more information, Dancer Relations Mail Call Captain Adrienne Mudry said to visit the <a href=\"https://thon.org/make-a-difference/mail-call/\" target=\"_blank\">Dancer Mail page on the THON site</a>.</p>\n                <p>The current mailroom for THON Dancer Mail is located in Findlay Commons. Here, THON volunteers, with the help of a few Universal Parcel Service employees, collect and organize the mail by dancer, according to Mudry, a fourth-year studying biobehavioral health.</p>\n                <p>Mudry said the mailroom also has donations from local businesses to help with the mail sorting effort.</p>\n                <p>The mailroom receives over 10,000 letters and upwards of 600 packages, according to Roynan.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis semester we get donations from GIANT, they give us banana boxes which hold all the letter bags we get donated from Wegmans,\u201d Mudry said. \u201cThat's to have sustainability, they give us the reusable grocery bags, and then we label every single grocery bag with the dancers, number and letter.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In the past, not every dancer was sent mail, but Mudry said they now work to ensure that every dancer receives at least ten pieces of mail to read. Each dancer is also able to be given two packages.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe send out lots of emails to the families and the THON Chairs encouraging them if they know people who are dancing, or if their friends from their org are dancing, to write them letters,\u201d Roynan said. \u201cAnd if they don't know people who are dancing, they can write generic mail.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Matt Miller danced in THON 2025 with the Sapphire Leadership Academic Program and said his dancer mail came at the \u201cperfect time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI remember opening the first couple from family and friends \u2026 people from my organization,\u201d Miller, a 2025 Penn State alum, said. \u201cI was in Nittany Lion Consulting Group, and folks on our executive board were writing stuff, people that I had been on committees with from two years ago sending stuff, and then even the mail itself is really important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Miller said collecting his mail provided him with a \u201cneeded boost.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou never know the impact it could have,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe impact it has is wonderful, and I still to this day have kept my notes.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In writing letters to dancers, Roynan said there are a few things to avoid mentioning.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTry not to mention \u2018Oh, you're almost finished, can't wait to go home and sleep or take a shower,\u2019 that kind of stuff,\u201d Roynan said. \u201cWhen we do it, it's toward the later hours of THON, so a lot of the dancers are typically struggling at that time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mudry said she\u2019s always remembered seeing dancers reading their mail in the THON recap video, and recalls them looking \u201cso happy or touched by it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cEven if it's just a silly little letter with some jokes in there, they're not expecting certain letters from some people most of the time,\u201d Mudry said. \u201cPeople don't realize how important a heartfelt, little, tiny message could be.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE THON COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>To no surprise of Penn State hockey fans, Matilde Fantin is succeeding on the Olympic stage.</p>\n                <p>After scoring a goal in Italy\u2019s win over France and being held scoreless against Sweden, Fantin powered through with two goals in Italy\u2019s 3-2 win over Japan.</p>\n                <p>It was a slow opening period, as the first 12 minutes showed no change to the scoreboard.</p>\n                <p>Despite no score, Italy's dominance was on display, holding the advantage in faceoffs and shots on goal.</p>\n                <p>At the 12:34 mark of the first quarter, Fantin found the back of the goal, marking her second score of the Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>The Penn State star was assisted by Laura Lobis and Kayla Tutino, putting Team Italy up early.</p>\n                <p>After another few minutes of Italian dominance on all sides of the ice, Fantin struck again to take a 2-0 lead with 1:09 left in the period.</p>\n                <p>Fantin\u2019s second goal came off an Italian power play after a two-minute interference call against Japan\u2019s Kohane Sato. With time to spare, Nadia Mattivi and Laura Fortino dished the puck to Fantin with the advantage.</p>\n                <p>While the remaining minutes of the first period and the first two minutes of the second period were without action, Japan got its first goal on the board quickly out of the middle period.</p>\n                <p>Rui Ukita put the Japanese on the board early, assisted by Rio Noro.</p>\n                <p>After Japan\u2019s score in the opening minutes, things came to a standstill for the remaining 17 minutes of the first half. Besides a tripping penalty by Italy\u2019s Carola Saletta, the scoreboard remained empty as the Italians took a 2-1 lead into the final 20 minutes.</p>\n                <p>That scoreline didn\u2019t last long, however, as Kristin Della Rovere netted an unassisted goal just 37 seconds into the period to make it a two-goal lead again.</p>\n                <p>Things looked to be smooth sailing the rest of the way for Team Italy, who had control of the puck for most of the third period. However, Akane Shiga made it a one-point game at the 11:01 mark with her first goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>While the Japanese made things a lot tighter down the final stretch, Fantin and Italy held their momentum and earned their second win of the Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>Fantin and Team Italy will face off against Germany at 10:40 a.m. on Tuesday in their final preliminary game. Italy\u2019s win over Japan put it in position for a quarterfinals appearance, but it will need to hold a top-three finish in Group B to do so.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Emma Strickling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s the final scene in the movie. The two lovers are reunited as the music swells. After a confession of love, they kiss. The screen fades and eventually reads \u201cThe End.\u201d The lights come back on as people exit the theatre. Feelings of jealousy, loneliness and angst swirl inside of those who attended alone.</p>\n                <p>The feeling of wanting to be in a relationship is a year-round occurrence for some. However, it\u2019s often exacerbated with the approach of Valentine\u2019s Day. Our society seems to depict being single as the social equivalent of the plague. But in reality, it\u2019s perfectly fine to not be in a relationship right now.</p>\n                <p>You might have read that last line with an accompanying scoff, as if that sentence alone can cure the perpetual feeling of yearning, but it\u2019s true. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being alone.</p>\n                <p>Sure, it might feel awkward if you are one of the only ones in your friend group without a partner, but it\u2019s only awkward if you make it that way. Just because you\u2019re single doesn\u2019t mean you're less worthy than those in relationships.</p>\n                <p>Of course, there\u2019s a type of validation that comes with being in a relationship and it\u2019s something that can make us feel good. But if it becomes something that you are desperately seeking out from others, then you\u2019re placing your self-worth in their hands.</p>\n                <p>We put being in a relationship on a pedestal and once we enter one, it\u2019s meant to fix everything or so we\u2019re made to believe.</p>\n                <p>But I think putting so much emphasis on romantic relationships ends up being harmful. It creates expectations that any problems you have with yourself or in your own life will simply be resolved. But when that doesn\u2019t happen, it leaves you feeling disappointed and frustrated because it wasn\u2019t the magical fix it was built up to be.</p>\n                <p>This desire for escape can lead to being in a relationship just for the sake of being in one, where expectations are lowered, leading to excuses being made for the unsavory behavior of the other person. At that point, you\u2019re wasting your own time.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s also perfectly fine to not want to be in a relationship either. Whether people care to acknowledge it or not, relationships take a lot of time and effort.</p>\n                <p>If you have areas of your life you want to focus on, then why should you let someone else and their nonsense get in the way. Yes, there\u2019s a possibility to do both. But there\u2019s the likelihood of needing to make compromises that lead to you sacrificing your own goals.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s more than one way to live life and you shouldn\u2019t let societal expectations force you into a life you don\u2019t want. This is especially true for women, as it\u2019s often parroted that our only function in life is to be in a relationship. If you have a goal you want to reach, why should you put it on hold for someone else?</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m not trying to say that being in a relationship is bad. It\u2019s fine to recognize that it\u2019s something you would like to have in your future. The problem is when it\u2019s something that turns into an obsessive need and your only priority, to the point where you base your self-worth on whether or not you\u2019re getting romantic attention.</p>\n                <p>It's important to ask yourself why you want to be in a relationship. Go beyond the reasoning of \u201cI just want one,\u201d and think about why.</p>\n                <p>If you want to share your life with someone and want to grow with someone while maintaining independence, then there\u2019s a possibility for a healthy relationship. If you\u2019re just looking to fill a void, then you should probably turn your attention inward to what it is you really need.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

The willingness to participate in events when you\u2019re scared only makes the memories even fonder to look back on.</p>\n                <p>Being an abroad student in a foreign country has put me in situations I\u2019ve never experienced before. But every time I chose to take the risk, the reward made it worth it.</p>\n                <p>Edinburgh, Scotland, is an excellent destination to try things you\u2019ve never done before. The vibrant city is filled with a bustling environment, bright red double-decker buses, slanted cobble roads and historic buildings looming in the distance.</p>\n                <p>Although Scotland sees a generous amount of rain, this doesn\u2019t diminish any of the opportunities it presents. As I grew more comfortable living in this country, I noticed important events I should take time out of my day to participate in. It\u2019s vital to research potential activities or discuss suggestions with friends to make the most of the time abroad.</p>\n                <p>Scotland is the perfect place for new experiences and saying \u201cYes!\u201d to embracing the unknown. It\u2019s a great location for travelers to meet people from around the world. Everyone is willing to converse and compare their backgrounds. The exchange of culture and tradition is prominent in the capital, and Edinburgh is proud to share its history with others.</p>\n                <p>As I walked around the city as a tourist, the number of cafes stood out to me. Each with their own charm, the cafes welcomed customers who were interested in enjoying the calming atmospheres they provided. Cafes are the perfect place for a filling breakfast, a chat with a friend or a delicious coffee with a biscuit. When visiting Scotland, look around for new coffee spots that could be your new study place.</p>\n                <p>Always say \u201cyes!\u201d when exploring the city. Grab a couple of friends or go on a solo adventure discovering where your favorite place could be. The city is packed with stores, souvenir shops, restaurants, pubs and more.</p>\n                <p>Being in a foreign country presents the best opportunity to sample unique food and drinks. It might surprise you to learn what food you could enjoy.</p>\n                <p>Scotland also has many historic locations to visit that require a hike to reach the desired location. There are castles open to the public brimming with Scottish history. One of the most popular attractions is interacting with the highland cows. In Scotland, the word \u201ccow\u201d is pronounced \u201ccoo.\u201d</p>\n                <p>These special cows native to Scotland have a bright orange coat with two long horns. They can be found in multiple areas in Scotland, and are astonishing to see in person.</p>\n                <p>Tourists are encouraged to visit the farms, and spectate the herd of cows known to roam freely. For people who want to limit the amount of hiking, there are a few highland cows in enclosures at the front of some of the farms. This promotes accessibility to all. It\u2019s important to take time to say \u201cyes!\u201d and go on the journey to see all the sights Scotland has to offer.</p>\n                <p>By starting your day with saying \u201cyes!\u201d you open the door to a whole new batch of possibilities. My suggestion is to try starting with a small activity to say \u201cyes!\u201d to, and discover the positive effects it has. These can include meeting new people, promoting a healthier lifestyle and boosting your mood.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is the perfect university to start this small change, and get accustomed to saying \u201cyes!\u201d more often. It\u2019s full of clubs, a variety of food and life on or off-campus. The power of the word \u201cyes!\u201d can be an amazing sight to witness.</p>\n                <p>MORE ABROAD COLUMNS</p>",

    "title": "5 Black artists in The Palmer Museum of Art",
    "author": "Ava Crawley | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When most people think of lavish art museums, State College doesn\u2019t exactly come to mind \u2014 yet right here on campus is a cultural treasure trove that students often walk past. The Palmer Museum of Art, home to the largest art collection between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, displays walls filled with history, protest and beauty.</p>\n                <p>As Black History Month approaches, one place to celebrate the creativity of Black artists is the Palmer Museum of Art. From contemporary art to sculptures, to American art, the museum reminds us of the powerful artists and moving stories that extend far beyond the frame.</p>\n                <p>Howardena Pindell (American b. 1943), Untitled 1969-73</p>\n                <p>Pindell expresses more through color and texture on a canvas than most can through words. After Pindell studied at Yale University and mentored with Josef Albers, she learned to embrace abstract art during a time when many Black artists began to portray racial identity through their work.</p>\n                <p>Inspired by Claude Monet and Georges Seurat, Pindell developed her signature style of brightly hued repetitive dots using acrylic paint and stencils. However, the dots represent far more than an eye-catching design, they symbolize her past.</p>\n                <p>Pindell recalls childhood trips for root beer with her father, moments marked not by sweetness but by segregation. Red circles stamped on the bottom of the mugs, indicating the glasses were reserved for people of color, became burned into her memory. In her work, those circles reappear. Turning from symbols of exclusion into proof of resilience, Pindell confronts racial trauma one dot at a time.</p>\n                <p>Barkley L. Hendricks (American, 1945-2017), \u201cFather, Son, and \u2026,\u201d 1969</p>\n                <p>Born and raised in Philadelphia, Hendricks grew up on basketball courts, playing pickup games, and proudly cheering on the Philadelphia 76ers. Before earning a master\u2019s degree in fine arts at Yale University, he focused on his abstraction skills through a series of basketball inspired paintings.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn Father, Son, and\u2026,\u201d he strips the game down to its essential geometry and color. The work's spiritual title and three paneled composition honors the neighborhood regulars who filled the basketball courts during pickup games, turning cracked cement into spaces of connection and belonging.</p>\n                <p>Purvis Young (American, 1943-2010), Untitled, 1999</p>\n                <p>The theme of protest emerges in Young's work. Working with found materials, like discarded wood, Young pays homage to the legacy of the Black Power mural movement of the late 1960s.</p>\n                <p>His figures \u2014 arms raised in defiance \u2014 confront injustice face-to-face. Through this piece, Young proves that protest does not need to be grand scale. All it takes is passion, paint and a surface willing to illustrate the message.</p>\n                <p>Ren\u00e9e Stout (American, b. 1958) \u201cPortrait of Fatima at Forty-Five\u201d, 2004</p>\n                <p>Stout uses found objects and fragmented images of her body to build Fatima, a middle-aged woman who owns a root store, filled with potions and herbal remedies. Fatima not only represents parts of Stout she felt pressured to suppress in order to feel accepted, but also portrays the spiritual practices of Afro-Caribbean Vodou traditions.</p>\n                <p>Through this layered portrait, Stout speaks directly to those searching for the power within them.</p>\n                <p>Louis B. Sloan (American 1932-2008), Untitled (Portrait of a Boy) about 1958-67</p>\n                <p>Sloan studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and eventually became its first Black instructor. He was known for his depictions of Philadelphia\u2019s rowhomes and dark alleyways. However, in this piece, the architecture dims and the spotlight shifts to a young boy.</p>\n                <p>His identity remains unknown, but it's believed that Sloan, an artist, mentor and teacher, could have very easily crossed paths with him before, exemplifying the idea of the countless untold stories that exist beyond the canvas.</p>\n                <p>Coming Works</p>\n                <p>\u201cInsistent Presence: Contemporary African Art from the Chazen Collection\u201d is coming to the Palmer Museum of Art Feb. 7 to May 10.</p>\n                <p>The exhibition features works from artists across the African continent and is arranged in three sections. Each section will invite viewers to reflect on themselves and their relationships, according to <a href=\"https://palmermuseum.psu.edu/exhibition/insistent-presence/\" target=\"_blank\">palmermuseum.edu</a>.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "7 things to do for the \u2018bit\u2019 at Penn State",
    "author": "Suzain Khan | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>College is already unserious, so why not lean into it. Between sprinting to class, convincing yourself that an iced coffee is a valid meal and spending time on a workload that never seems to go down, there\u2019s a sense of fun to be found almost anywhere.</p>\n                <p>So if you\u2019re already going to do something slightly unnecessary, mildly inconvenient or a little dramatic, you might as well commit.</p>\n                <p>Here is a list of things you can do for \u201cthe bit\u201d this spring semester.</p>\n                <p>1. Go out wearing a brightly colored wig and pretend to be someone else</p>\n                <p>Pick the color with the most personality \u2014 blue, pink, purple or whatever your heart desires \u2014 and commit fully. Give yourself a new name and backstory, and introduce yourself with confidence like this version of you has always existed. Adopt a whole new persona and then never acknowledge it again.</p>\n                <p>2. Do something mildly embarrassing on purpose and survive it</p>\n                <p>Pick anything that might make you feel nervous and do it.</p>\n                <p>Wear something slightly questionable, speak up when you normally wouldn\u2019t, laugh a little too loudly or pick a \u201ccheugy\u201d word and keep saying it with friends. The moment passes and you\u2019ll realize no one cares.</p>\n                <p>Embarrassment only lasts as long as you let it, which is kind of freeing and also deeply funny.</p>\n                <p>3. Dress formally for a 9 a.m. lecture</p>\n                <p>Everyone else is in sweats, half-asleep and clutching a coffee like it\u2019s life support. Imagine how much fun it could be if you show up dressed like you have a networking event, or take it a step further and wear a prom dress. Commitment matters.</p>\n                <p>Even if you go straight home afterward, the confidence boost is worth it.</p>\n                <p>4. Sit in a completely different spot in lecture everyday</p>\n                <p>Front row today, back corner tomorrow. Pick somewhere you\u2019ve never sat before just to keep things interesting. It changes nothing academically but it keeps everyone, including yourself, slightly unsettled. Sometimes a small shake-up is the only thrill you get before noon.</p>\n                <p>5. Get a fun drink downtown instead of eating actual food</p>\n                <p>Is it a meal? No. Does it have nutritional value? Debatable. Will you convince yourself it counts as sustenance anyway? Absolutely. It\u2019s colorful, has ice and feels like a treat, which is honestly enough to justify on a random weekday.</p>\n                <p>Bonus points if you pick a place or drink you haven\u2019t tried before. Whether you hate it or not, you\u2019ll still get a kick out of trying something new.</p>\n                <p>6. Go into the wrong class with a friend and stay for exactly thirty seconds</p>\n                <p>Sit down confidently and start a loud conversation about something completely unrelated \u2014 weekend plans, a fake argument or a story that makes no sense in context. Let the confusion settle in. Notice the professor pause, then stand up, walk out calmly and never react. Timing matters, so try to be in and out before it becomes a problem.</p>\n                <p>7. Complain about Penn State while secretly loving it</p>\n                <p>You\u2019ll talk about how chaotic, overwhelming and unserious it is \u2014 then immediately defend it if anyone else criticizes it. You act like you\u2019re exhausted by it all, but you know you\u2019d miss it the second you left. That contradiction? That\u2019s part of the bit.</p>\n                <p>One day, Penn State will be something you talk about in the past tense. Until then, embrace the chaos, complain lovingly and do a few things just for the stories made along the way. That\u2019s the bit and it\u2019s worth it.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State basketball hosted USC, and both teams had very different seasons up to the clash, but once they stepped onto the hardwood, the play became intertwined, making it harder and harder to distinguish the two as the clock ticked inside the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, that remained the trend the entire game, as the Trojans snagged a victory in the last ten seconds of play, courtesy of freshman Alijah Arenas\u2019s buzzer-beater already making the rounds on social media.</p>\n                <p>The boxscore reinforced that sentiment, with almost all stats level after 40 minutes of play, except on the defensive side of the ball, where the Trojans continued to disrupt any chance at a blue and white win.</p>\n                <p>Both squads were banged up, with three players sidelined, yet that didn\u2019t appear to fluster the Nittany Lions; they maintained their momentum, though it did halt the fluidity of their play.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey played good defense,\u201d Josh Reed said. \u201cWe made a lot of mistakes, we had a lot of turnovers, and (USC) scored off every turnover. I feel like if we kept our mistakes to a minimum, it would have been a different game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The blue and white, which is one of seven Big Ten teams averaging fewer than 10 turnovers per game and is tied for second in the conference in steals per game, yet it was its opponent who implemented those trends in the game.</p>\n                <p>At halftime, the Nittany Lions led 40-36, with a growing opportunity to earn their second conference win exactly a week after their first. Soon after the break, the lead extended to 12, but the writing was on the wall; the Trojans matched the Nittany Lions' assist and steal totals, while USC turned the ball over three times fewer.</p>\n                <p>That cleaned-up effort by the warriors from the West Coast allowed USC to cut into the lead quickly after the Nittany Lions got that double-digit lead \u2013 a factor that allowed them to steal the win from under Penn State coach Mike Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen we got that lead we had, we made some bad, poor decisions,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201c(Either) with turnovers, or around the basket, jumping up on the air, fighting a shot, and that leads in the turnovers, and I thought that was the difference in the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the Trojans arrived in Happy Valley, it wasn\u2019t expected to have stellar play ready to disrupt the Nittany Lions on both sides. USC ranked as the Big Ten's leader in turnovers per contest and also arrived with a bottom-five points-allowed figure in the conference \u2013 the only teams it trailed all also had negative point differentials.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions also outranked the Trojans\u2019 steal metrics, as USC tied for No. 6.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe've done a great job all year with this group of not turning the ball over,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI just thought we had way too many turnovers that led to them getting baskets that we couldn't defend.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions finished with two more turnovers than USC\u2019s 15, which even clears the Trojans average of the most turnovers in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Coaching wasn\u2019t happy, players were even less so, and all the fans in the BJC, sporting various-colored shirts for THON, as the stands began to resemble a gumball machine, had their own bubbles burst in what was one of the liveliest home crowds for Penn State this year.</p>\n                <p>\u201c17 turnovers (is) just too many,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI don't care who you play; it's really hard to win with 17 turnovers. Playing talented players, and you give them more opportunities; give them the ball to get going. It's really hard.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Nonetheless, despite the visibly disgruntled Penn State squad, which appeared heartbroken by such a tragic way to lose, it looks ready to turn around and keep fighting, knowing exactly what to address.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're gonna hit the road tomorrow, go out west,\u201d Reed said. \u201c(We\u2019ll) watch film, try to learn from our mistakes, and be ready to play Washington.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>USC guard Alijah Arenas gathered an inbounds pass near the middle of the court. The Trojans and Penn State were knotted up with seven seconds left, and Arenas had a chance to win it for his squad.</p>\n                <p>Arenas did exactly that as he drove into the paint and laid in a game-winning basket with less than a second left. The shot gave USC a 77-75 victory on Sunday, marking the Nittany Lions\u2019 sixth loss by single digits this season.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades mentioned Penn State was \u201cswitching everything\u201d coming out of the last timeout, saying one of his players didn\u2019t follow that plan.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe didn't execute the defensive switch at the end,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThat's just disappointing. That's on me, going to continue to keep helping these guys have late-game mental toughness and approach. You pride yourself as a coach to win close games, and I haven't done that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>During his time at Penn State, which is since the start of the 2023-24 season, Rhoades has lost 26 games by single digits. For comparison, the Nittany Lions have won 16 matchups by single digits under Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>On the Nittany Lions\u2019 final defensive possession of Sunday\u2019s game, guard Freddie Dilione V defended Arenas down to the basket. Forward Josh Reed came in to help, and 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107 was guarding a different player in the paint.</p>\n                <p>Guard Kayden Mingo stayed near the perimeter while guard Dominick Stewart was right next to the paint after defending a player on the opposite side of the court as Arenas.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe just made a tough move, tough play,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI tried to come over and help. Not much I can do about that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State came back to give itself a chance to win, making all five of its last five field-goal attempts. Rhoades said he felt his players executed on some plays down the stretch, but it didn\u2019t happen on the last defensive play of the game.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s been other times this season where the Nittany Lions failed to execute late before losing a game by a close margin. Against Michigan on Jan. 6, Penn State didn\u2019t create any open looks on its last possession of the game before losing, 74-72.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou want to be as mistake-free as you can late in the game,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIt happens, right? Sometimes a play messes something up, and a guy thinks differently or does differently. I mean, that's why you play the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to crunch time, Penn State led by as many as 12 points in the second half, which came when it led 50-38 with 17:23 left in the game. USC dwindled the advantage as the Nittany Lions endured numerous miscues, first taking a lead at 56-55 with 10:56 left.</p>\n                <p>But the most impactful mistake came right at the end as Penn State was one less play by Arenas away from picking up its second Big Ten win of the year. Players looked stunned after the game-winning shot, but Reed knows there\u2019s still more basketball to be played with seven games left in the regular season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt definitely hurts,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe have basically a game every other two or three days, so we're gonna hit the road tomorrow, watch film, try to learn from our mistakes, and be ready to play Washington on Wednesday.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>In its annual THON game, Penn State hosted USC for the first time in program history.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 2-1 all-time record against the Trojans took a hit on Super Bowl Sunday, as the blue and white suffered a 77-75 loss that came down to the last few seconds.</p>\n                <p>\u201cClose, but no cigar. Just not enough to finish down the stretch,\u201d Mike Rhoades said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a great job all year with this group of not turning the ball over, and today we just had way too many turnovers that led to them getting baskets.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ivan Juri\u0107 won the opening tipoff for the blue and white but failed on his efforts in the post, leading to an easy Jacob Cofie bucket to put USC on the board first.</p>\n                <p>Josh Reed, who had a solid recent stretch of games entering Sunday\u2019s contest, took it down the court and gave Penn State its first points of the night before quickly getting two more just a couple of possessions later to give the Nittany Lions their first lead of the day.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been trying to play confident and aggressive,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI just want to win\u2026 My teammates make me better as well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State held on to the lead despite some alternating scores until a triple from Alijah Arenas, son of three-time NBA all-star Gilbert Arenas, put the Trojans back on top with a slight 11-10 edge.</p>\n                <p>A freshman, Arenas had appeared in just five games prior to his squad\u2019s matchup with the Nittany Lions. Despite that, he is USC\u2019s fourth-highest scorer, averaging 11.8 points per game.</p>\n                <p>At the media timeout at the 12- minute mark, the Trojans held a 14-13 lead after a Juri\u010b three-pointer sent the colorful THON shirt-wearing Bryce Jordan Center into a frenzy.</p>\n                <p>Another big man three-pointer, this time from seven-footer Justin Houser, tied the contest at 16-16. Houser was averaging 1.5 points per game through 11 appearances.</p>\n                <p>Ezra Ausar put down a big two-handed slam on the fast break after picking up a steal on Freddie Dilione V before Reed hit the tip-in off a missed Houser triple, which tied the game again at 25-25.</p>\n                <p>Dilione made up for it not long after, though, knocking down a trey to reclaim the lead before USC wrote back, with Jordan Marsh hitting his own three-pointer to keep a two-point advantage.</p>\n                <p>Kayden Mingo got just his fourth point of the game after a little shimmy shook his defender, as an easy layup cut the Nittany Lions\u2019 deficit to two points, down 32-34 with just over three minutes left to play in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Dilione fought through some tough contact at the rim off a nice pass from Mingo, but went down holding his knee before a timeout. He may have just gotten tangled up, though, as he was back on the court after the timeout, looking just fine.</p>\n                <p>Consecutive scores from Reed as time was winding down gave Penn State a 40-36 lead at the half and gave him the second-most points for the blue and white with 10.</p>\n                <p>The shooting numbers for each side at the half were more-or-less identical, with the Nittany Lions shooting 53% from the field and 31% from three-point range compared to the Trojans\u2019 50% and 30% marks.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was also outrebounding USC 19-13 at the half \u2013 something that has been difficult for the Nittany Lions, as they\u2019ve been the second-worst rebounding team in the Big Ten this season while the Trojans have been among the best, sitting in the top-five in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u010b started the second half off the same way he did the first, scoring a tough bucket through double coverage before a Dominick Stewart three-pointer the possession after to get the Nittany Lions off to a red-hot start.</p>\n                <p>In a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it kind of sequence, Mingo picked up a steal off Marsh and dished it down the court to Dilione, who turned it into a big one-handed slam, giving Penn State all the momentum as the blue and white pulled ahead to a 50-38 lead in the early running of the second half.</p>\n                <p>Mingo is averaging 2.2 steals per game as well as 4.5 assists and is the only freshman in the country to do so along with 13-plus points and 3.5-plus rebounds.</p>\n                <p>Dilione stayed hot and moved up to 19 points on a fast break, calling his own number to maintain an 11 point lead before the first media timeout of the second half.</p>\n                <p>A physical Houser block and rebound turned into a standing ovation from the student section as he walked to the bench with Juri\u010b coming in to replace him, though the freshman was having one of his best games out of a small sample size.</p>\n                <p>Ausar moved into foul trouble territory after picking up another personal, much to the delight of the legion of blue, which had been vocal all day. It was the 13th personal foul for the Trojans, with eight team fouls.</p>\n                <p>Marsh, who had been called for a tech earlier, knocked down a triple that moved USC within two points of Penn State\u2019s once 12 point lead, as he cut it to a 51-53 Trojan deficit.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey played good defense, but I think it was more so on us,\u201d Reed said about Penn State\u2019s scoring deficit. \u201cIf we kept our mistakes to a minimum, it would have been a different game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Trojans picked up their first lead of the game since the later stages of the first half after a Kam Woods free throw following a Houser foul.</p>\n                <p>A Juri\u010b and-one following yet another USC foul brought Penn State closer to recapturing the lead as the Trojans were sitting on a 64-61 lead with just about five minutes left in the game.</p>\n                <p>Dilione was the first from either end to reach the 20 point mark as he knocked one down from the charity stripe to cut the Trojan lead to 66-67 with time winding down in the second half.</p>\n                <p>Reed knocked down a triple off the dump-off from Dilione to make it a 71-72 ballgame with a minute left to play before Arenas was fouled and knocked down both free throws to put the Trojans up 74-71 with just 30 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n                <p>A Stewart score brought the Nittany Lions within one point of the lead, but with having to intentionally foul, Penn State sent Arenas to the line, where he only knocked down one of two, leading to a Dilione coast-to-coast basket that tied the game at 75-75.</p>\n                <p>With just 7.3 seconds on the clock, Arenas knocked down the game-winning score, leaving Penn State with just 0.7 seconds to throw up a Hail Mary that wouldn\u2019t fall, as the Trojans escaped with a 77-75 victory.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s on me. I\u2019ve got to do better,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute the defensive switch at the end and that\u2019s just disappointing. That\u2019s on me.

    "title": "Penn State softball suffers first loss of the season off an error against Auburn",
    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After starting the season 4-0 for just the fourth time in program history, Penn State looked to stay unbeaten against Auburn for its last game of the NFCA Leadoff Classic on Sunday morning. Meanwhile, the Tigers entered the contest 3-2 and looked to bounce back after a close loss to Pitt in their previous game.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white weren\u2019t able to leave Florida undefeated after a costly error ended the game, and it suffered its first loss of the fresh campaign, 4-3.</p>\n                <p>A pair of right-handed sophomores took the mound for both squads in the Sunshine State. Abigail Britton got the ball for the Nittany Lions while the Tigers started Ella Harrison.</p>\n                <p>Both starters ran into some early trouble on the base paths but prevailed and allowed no runs. The blue and white went down quietly after Harrison committed a throwing error to first and leadoff Kaylie Walters reached second. While Kylie Shaw led off with a smoked double to left field, Britton settled in and retired the next three Tigers\u2019 batters in order.</p>\n                <p>Harrison quickly found a groove in the second and struck out sophomore Natalie Lieto and junior Michela Barbanente back-to-back, then senior Madison Seidel grounded for the third out. Despite Penn State\u2019s offense not producing early, Auburn\u2019s offense provided Harrison with some cushion in its half of the inning.</p>\n                <p>Britton hit McKaela Walker with one out, then Kylie Brockman smacked a double down the left field line, and Britton quickly found herself in a first and third situation. Kyla Stroud lifted a sacrifice fly to right fielder Breanna Hanik and plated the game\u2019s opening run, 1-0.</p>\n                <p>While pinch runner Georgia Lessmann advanced to third on the flyout, Britton minimized the damage and forced a popout to end the scoring.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions couldn\u2019t produce much in the third, but Walters\u2019 two-out bunt gave them their first hit against Harrison. With the top of the Auburn lineup due up, coach Clarrisa Crowell turned to her bullpen and brought in freshman Mackenzie Duncan. The Winter Garden Florida native produced a needed shutdown and inning, keeping the deficit at one.</p>\n                <p>As the game progressed, the pressure continued mounting offensively for the Nittany Lions. Harrison continued her dominance on the mound and struck out all three blue and white batters in the fourth. After surrendering a leadoff single by Haven Roebuck, Duncan mowed down the next three Tigers\u2019 batters.</p>\n                <p>Just like their comeback victory in the Nittany Lions' last game against BYU, they persevered and finally broke through in the fifth. Lieto led off the inning with a walk, and the inning quickly put pressure on Harrison as she surrendered her second error on another throw to first. With Lieto on third and Seidel on second after she aggressively swiped a bag, Hanik hit a timely RBI infield single to shortstop Alyssa Hastings.</p>\n                <p>Penn State tied the game at one, but was looking for more. The blue and white stayed aggressive on the base paths with Hanik stealing second. The lineup turned over and leadoff Walters laid a successful bunt down and reached first. However, Harrison escaped the one-out bases-loaded jam after retiring junior Brooke Klosowiza and freshman Allison Oneacre.</p>\n                <p>The tie didn\u2019t last for long as the Tigers cracked Duncan in the bottom half of the fifth. Shaw caught the Nittany Lions off guard and successfully reached on a one-out bunt. After Ma\u2019Nia Womack flew out to Hanik, Destiny Rodriguez hammered a clutch two-out RBI double to center. Duncan allowed just one run in the inning, but Auburn now took the lead late, 2-1.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white rallied once again in the very next inning. Entering the sixth, Harrison allowed just three hits and recorded an impressive 10 strikeouts. Yet, Penn State found some much-needed offensive momentum.</p>\n                <p>Barbanente won a very long at-bat, and Harrison suffered just her second walk of the day. Lieto entered the batter\u2019s box with some pressure as the Nittany Lions haven\u2019t had many baserunners throughout the game. The Monroe, Connecticut, native seized the moment and smashed a two-run home run to left field, giving Penn State its first lead of the game, 3-2.</p>\n                <p>Crowell made another pitching change and brought in star junior Bridget Nemeth to preserve the small lead. The Tigers wouldn\u2019t go down easy as Haven Roebuck split the right center field gap for a timely leadoff double.</p>\n                <p>After a sacrifice fly advanced Roebuck to third, Brockman delivered an RBI single to right field. The pressure now turned on Nemeth with the game tied once again.</p>\n                <p>Stroud hit a dribbler and it could\u2019ve possibly been an inning-ending double play, but Walters bobbled it at shortstop, and Auburn had a runner in scoring position again with just one out. However, Nemeth displayed why she\u2019s an elite pitcher and struck out the next two Tigers\u2019 batters to preserve the tie.</p>\n                <p>The seventh started with some Penn State offense as Hanik singled down the left field line, then stole second.

After an attacking error from Sean Harvey, the teams tied at 9-9.</p>\n                <p>After keeping the score tight on both sides, the Nittany Lions were able to pull away with a two-point lead after a service error from the other end of the court, making the score 15-13.</p>\n                <p>Penn State kept the lead within two for several points. It finally pulled away to 19-16 after Owen Rose logged the first service ace of the match. Back-to-back attacking errors from the Red Flash put Penn State up 21-16, forcing a Saint Francis timeout.</p>\n                <p>A kill from Gaige Gabriel put the blue and white at set point. With one final kill from Matthew Luoma, the Nittany Lions were able to take the first set 25-19.</p>\n                <p>The second set opened with back-to-back points for the Red Flash.

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When Preston Hawkins made his collegiate debut in the season-opener against Colgate last Sunday, nothing went according to plan. A difficult line of sight inside Holuba Hall, coupled with a breakneck pace of offense, resulted in the true freshman being replaced by Hayes Schreiner midway through the second quarter after only making a single save.</p>\n                <p>Coach Jeff Tambroni elected to once more place his trust in the Powell, Ohio, native on Saturday afternoon when No. 7 Penn State faced unranked Villanova inside Holuba Hall. Hawkins seized the opportunity and put together a solid performance in his second career start, closing out the game with eight saves on 22 shots for a .364 save percentage.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were upset in overtime, 14-13.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Hawkins) felt like in a lot of ways he let us down (against Colgate), which was not anywhere near the case. I talked to him through Sunday and Monday, watched him rebound this week, just let him know that we still have the confidence in him,\u201d Tambroni said. \u201cIt wasn't the physical or the ability piece, it was more the mental piece.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Unlike the game against Colgate, the Wildcats and the Nittany Lions were locked in a low-scoring affair through the first half. This was in part due to Hawkins\u2019 efforts, making six saves on 12 shots going into halftime with the score knotted at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Hawkins) seemed ready to go coming in (Holuba Hall) today, and made a huge save at the end of regulation, giving us a chance to even get into overtime,\u201d Tambroni said. (The loss) was in no way, shape or form anything he did. He put us in a position to be in that overtime period.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Hawkins\u2019 athleticism earned him the majority of his saves. The freshman wasn\u2019t shy to drop to the turf or use his body to block a shot. The goals that evaded him were mostly step-down shots with minimal coverage.</p>\n                <p>On the clear, Hawkins\u2019 role wasn\u2019t too complicated at this stage in the season. He took the ball from the crease after a save or from the backfield and delivered breakout passes to his defenders. However, the Wildcats were quick to pounce on the clear and caused turnovers in the chaos.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was methodical in the first twenty to thirty seconds of every possession, and then you accompanied that with the fact that we're not clearing the ball all that well, not picking the ball off the ground,\u201d Tambroni said. \u201cIt just seemed like it was an avalanche of possession time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>However, midway through the second quarter, Hawkins didn\u2019t see an open white jersey to pass to. As the Wildcats transitioned to a 10-man ride to combat Penn State\u2019s simple clearing strategy, Hawkins took a shot at the open goal but was blocked in the midfield.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s newest starting netminder follows in Jack Fracyon\u2019s footsteps and has a reputation to uphold. Last year, the Nittany Lions executed a deep postseason run through the NCAA Tournament but fell in the semifinals.</p>\n                <p>Hawkins already displayed a flash of the \u201cclutch gene\u201d needed to inherit the long-term position. With the game tied, 9-9, in the fourth quarter, Villanova midfielder Dan Martin ripped a shot aimed for Hawkins\u2019 five-hole. Hawkins sprawled for the save with his stick backed by his right leg before Hunter Aquino scored a go-ahead goal on the other end of the field.</p>\n                <p>Despite Penn State increasing its lead to 12-9, a series of defensive mistakes allowed Villanova to piece together a 4-0 run to take the lead with under three minutes remaining in the game. After defenseman Alex Ross scored the game-tying goal, Hawkins was faced with a potentially defining moment in his budding career.</p>\n                <p>Thirteen seconds remained in the game, and Colin Michener performed a dodge past Penn State\u2019s defense. On the subsequent shot, Hawkins came up with the standing save that sent the game to overtime.</p>\n                <p>Overtime. A single goal separated Hawkins from his first career collegiate win.</p>\n                <p>On Villanova\u2019s first possession of the overtime frame, the Nittany Lions\u2019 defense came up short.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to clean up,\u201d Tambroni said. \u201cThat was a frustrating loss.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State faced BYU with a chance to extend its undefeated start to the year, and the two programs had met only once, on the softball diamond in 2007, when the Nittany Lions prevailed.</p>\n                <p>Penn State prevailed again on Saturday, defeating the Cougars in an extra-inning thriller, 4-3.</p>\n                <p>There are more connections than at first glance, and only a limited time to act.</p>\n                <p>It all stems from a football head-coaching search in which the Cougars used an alumnus\u2019 money from his cookie empire to keep their guy, Kalani Sitake and taunt Nittany Lions fans.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s now a fitting moniker that should grace every time these schools meet in what looks to be a new rivalry for the ages, between two blue and white schools, mascot by big cats and it\u2019s the name \u201cthe Crumbl Cookie Clash\u201d.</p>\n                <p>With no other set-in-stone matchups in other sports between these two programs, this may be one of the few times they can address their differences, and it might be the best forum.</p>\n                <p>The softball edition of this meeting is possibly the most high-octane of any possible edition, as both units arrive in Clearwater, Florida, as extremely formidable squads. Penn State cruised to a 3-0 undefeated start, with a decisive win over EKU earlier Saturday in Game 1 of a doubleheader. BYU arrives with more rest, but a 1-2 record, as a unit that received preseason ranking votes, hasn\u2019t made good on the hype.</p>\n                <p>For the Nittany Lions, freshman Brevyn Kellepouris got the nod inside the circle, only her second collegiate appearance and her first-ever start. The rookie started off shaky with a walk and a wild pitch, but easily got out of the inning with some sweet stuff inside the circle.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, the blue and white bats started even slower, going down in order with their first attempt to pull ahead.</p>\n                <p>Penn State logged the first hit of the game in the bottom of the second, courtesy of second baseman Michela Barbanente, but ultimately it would be its opposition to strike first.</p>\n                <p>Kellepouris showed her first real signs of adversity this season, allowing a pair of singles and another pair of BYU baserunning moves, first by a passed ball, then a stolen base. Standout slugger Ilove'a Brittingham struck a single to bring in the first two runs of the game, and end the freshman arm\u2019s start.</p>\n                <p>Coach Clarissa Crowell chose the only viable option: its own superstar, pitcher Bridget Nemeth, who got out of the jam.</p>\n                <p>Maybe it was the Florida sunshine, but the Penn State bats stayed nocturnal into the bottom of the third frame. The Nittany Lions kept BYU busy, however, with two infield outs and a back-and-forth at bat between Cougars pitcher Kaysen Korth and Cara Bohner, which ended in a seven-pitch strikeout.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately for BYU, any momentum it had immediately halted to Nemeth\u2019s arm, as the ace cruised to a three-up, three-down inning, with an exclamation point put on the frame by a pair of punch outs.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions knocked a pair of hits in the fourth, as they attempted to get level, but a double play and a Barbanente out on a dropped third strike ended the inning.</p>\n                <p>Nemeth began to show signs of being human in the fifth, as a triad of consecutive two-out singles pulled BYU ahead by another run. Brittingham scored the run for the Cougars, brought in by Bre Townsend.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offense continued to crumble into the home half, as a pair of strikeouts sent them packing despite Breanna Hanik\u2019s single for her first collegiate hit.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white sent in late-game arm Abigail Britton to the circle to relieve Nemeth, who sent the offense back up unharmed into the sixth frame. Only a singular big swing defined the Penn State offense in that half, however, and it was that of its highest-ranked recruit in 2025, Allison Oneacre, who knocked her second dinger of the year, tying a team-high with Brooke Klosowicz, who homered earlier on the day.</p>\n                <p>Britton continued her sophomore season breakout inside the circle, with a quick inning to give the bats their last chance of the game to tie things up.</p>\n                <p>Barbanente stepped up first and reached base with an infield single, then, with savvy baserunning, got to second \u2013 rally started. Natalie Lieto attempted to follow up, but went right back to sit on the pine after a four-pitch strikeout. Crowell had just the bat on the bench; however, to shake things up, backup catcher Macy Chamberlin entered and smacked a double to bring the game within one.</p>\n                <p>Both coaches tinkered from there. Crowell took out Chamberlin on the bases, as BYU coach Gordon Eakin opted for Hailey Shuler inside the circle to save things.</p>\n                <p>Hanik put the ball in play, and sloppy Cougars\u2019 fielding allowed a run to score, tying the game with a runner on third after a groundout followed.</p>\n                <p>Bohner was the batter with the chance to send Penn State home with a win, but again went down on strikes in a long duel with the pitcher.</p>\n                <p>Britton continued to thrive, shutting down the Cougars\u2019 offense in the first inning of extras, punctuated by a fanning punch out to end the frame.</p>\n                <p>Crowell\u2019s squad then played small ball to almost guarantee the win, with the extra runner on second to start the home half. Oneacre laid down a perfect bunt to put the winning run 60 feet from winning the game.</p>\n                <p>Freshman first baseman Kirsten Finarelli stepped up to the plate and knocked a single through the infield to send Bohner home and improve Penn State to 4-0. In all four of the Lehman, Pennsylvania, native\u2019s appearances this season so far, she\u2019s reached base.</p>\n                <p>The last time the Nittany Lions softball started undefeated after four games was in 2024, the last season they made NCAA Regionals.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State plays its final game at the Eddie C. Moore Complex in Clearwater, Florida, at 10 a.m. on Sunday, against its second SEC foe of the year, this time Auburn. Streaming is available for free on GameChanger, with the blue and white having a chance to go home undefeated in its first series of the year.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Kiyomi McMiller produces career-high points in Penn State women\u2019s basketball loss to No. 12 Michigan State",
    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Kiyomi McMiller for two, McMiller for three; those are the two phrases that fans heard a lot of over the public address in Rec Hall against No.12 Michigan State on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>McMiller finished with a career-high 37 points, but Penn State was unable to pull off the upset bid, falling 81-70. This marked the Silver Spring, Maryland native\u2019s second-straight 30-point outing, and her third of the season. McMiller\u2019s previous career-high was 36 points in the Lady Lions 74-73 loss to Wisconsin on Jan. 4.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white had one of their best first-quarter performances of the season, scoring 28 points, 16 of which came from McMiller.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we got to figure out a way to capitalize on that first quarter,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said. \u201cIt was our best first quarter, I thought, in a couple of years.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McMiller, along with the rest of the Lady Lions, had a near-flawless opening frame. As a team, Penn State shot 11-for-16 from field-goal range, but McMiller went 7-for-8 on her own.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(I) focused on making those layups and making those points in the paint,\u201d McMiller said. \u201cThat was a big game changer for me in my head.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The sophomore guard\u2019s scoring effort got going right away. After Jalyn Brown got the Spartans on the scoreboard first with a two-point jumper, McMiller quickly answered with a three-pointer on the other end.</p>\n                <p>This marked the first of two shots from beyond the mark that McMiller netted in the opening quarter. The 5-foot-8 guard\u2019s offensive effort came mostly from two-point range, as she finished with three triples in the afternoon.</p>\n                <p>Behind the two three-pointers, a couple of baskets from inside, as well as sharing the wealth with other Lady Lions, McMiller guided Penn State to a 12-0 scoring run.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought we came out and had a lot of energy; we were playing really well together,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cOur chemistry was great, we were fun to watch, fun to coach, fun to play with each other.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McMiller put the cherry on top of a strong opening frame with an elbow jumper as just 12 seconds remained on the clock. This gave the blue and white a 15-point lead to close the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore went quiet in the second quarter, shooting 0-for-6 in the frame, but getting two points from the free throw line with just under two minutes left in the half. Still, McMiller went into the locker room with a little less than half of Penn State\u2019s points.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI got to the paint a lot, but I didn\u2019t finish the play,\u201d McMiller said. \u201cI think that I (need to) play a complete game all the way through all 40 minutes.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McMiller was still rather silent in the third quarter, finishing with seven points, but she was the Lady Lions\u2019 only scorer in the frame, allowing Michigan State to creep back into the game.</p>\n                <p>The fourth quarter was a similar showing, with McMiller scoring 12 of the blue and white\u2019s 18 points.</p>\n                <p>As a team, Penn State shot 28-for-61 from field-goal range, but McMiller was responsible for more than half of these attempts, going 16-for-33.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe got to share the basketball,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe have to move the ball and got to share it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Nonetheless, history is history, and despite the Lady Lions not getting the outcome they wanted, it was still a career afternoon for McMiller.</p>\n                <p>It originally looked like the guard wasn\u2019t going to meet her new career high, as she stood at 35 points with about 30 seconds left. However, a loose ball turned into a fast break layup, completing McMiller\u2019s outstanding effort against a top-15 opponent.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey shuts out Lindenwood in last away game of the regular season",
    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State showed off its goal-scoring ability after answering an early Lindenwood goal with five of its own in Game 1 on Friday. The Nittany Lions returned to the ice following a 6-3 win for their final away game of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>In their last game away from Happy Valley, the Nittany Lions used four different goal scorers to shut out the Lions 5-0.</p>\n                <p>Head coach Jeff Kampersal mixed up the lineup a bit in Game 2. Danica Maynard, who usually plays left defense, played her first game at left wing for Penn State. The Lake Country, British Columbia, native had a chance to show off her two-way ability with a smaller bench than usual. Maynard was among the several changes Kampersal made to the lineup.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions didn\u2019t take long to get on the board first as Grace Outwater shot a wrist shot off the faceoff in her offensive zone only three minutes into the game. Outwater seemingly can\u2019t stop scoring as this tally marked her ninth-straight game with a goal.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wanted more as Abby Stonehouse sent a quick wrist shot in the slot that beat Madison Bowtell\u2019s right shoulder.</p>\n                <p>After Lindenwood spent nearly all of the first period in its defensive zone, a spark of offense was shown from the Lions late in the period. Katie DeSa was tested with three scoring chances in close, all of which she was able to fend off as the opening period reached its end.</p>\n                <p>Unlike at the start of the first period, the opening five minutes of the middle frame were a back-and-forth affair, with both teams spending time in the attacking zone. Both DeSa and Bowtell were successful when tested with early scoring opportunities.</p>\n                <p>However, after an early surge from both teams, the puck took on a life of its own as both sides struggled to control it. Neither team had any luck developing a rush because turnovers in the neutral zone prevented it.</p>\n                <p>That was until Stonehouse had a chance to get her second of the game after a turnover in the offensive zone. Both Maynard and Stonehouse found themselves alone with Bowtell. A swift pass to Stonehouse led to a ringing of the post as the forward got all of the crossbar and none of the net.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions didn\u2019t miss their next chance as Mikah Keller skated into the offensive zone and scored after a wrist shot deflected off a skate and found its way into the net. Keller was one of the lineup changes, starting at first-line center.</p>\n                <p>A calmer middle frame came to a close after Leah Stecker went to the box for a late tripping call. Lindenwood wasn\u2019t able to capitalize before the buzzer rang and started the third period with 43 seconds left on the power play.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions came out of the gates firing in the first five minutes of the third period in hopes of adding to their lead, and that they did. Katelyn Roberts skated into the offensive zone with speed and sniped a wrist shot over the shoulder of Bowtell only five minutes into the final frame.</p>\n                <p>A dangerous surge of offense developed for the Lions after a Maddy Christian penalty put them on the power play. A scramble for the loose puck in DeSa\u2019s crease nearly resulted in the first goal of the game for Lindenwood. The Pawcatuck, Connecticut, native made a sprawling save to keep the puck out of her net.</p>\n                <p>Outwater was not done scoring. The Pickton, Ontario, native received a pass from Maddy Christian off the boards and sent a no-look backhand in the slot towards the back of the net. This tally ties Outwater for fourth nationally in goals with 23.</p>\n                <p>DeSa didn\u2019t take the last 60 seconds of the game off with the lead at 5-0. The senior was tested with a flurry of shots before the final buzzer, one being a rebound opportunity that resulted in another sprawling save.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to Pegula for its last series of the regular season against RIT. Game 1 is set to start at 6 p.m. on Feb. 13.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State played its second straight game in Holuba Hall on Saturday, but couldn\u2019t achieve the same result against Villanova.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions played a close game but ultimately fell to the Wildcats in overtime.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened the scoring just under two minutes into the first frame when Chase Robertson isolated his defender, dodged downhill and tucked the ball into the bottom of the net.</p>\n                <p>Villanova evened the score when David Link cut around the back of the cage and sank a close shot past goaltender Preston Hawkins</p>\n                <p>Hunter Aquino put the blue and white back in front near the quarter\u2019s midpoint with a strong step-down from ten yards away on a nifty feed from Jack Iannantuono.</p>\n                <p>Villanova returned fire soon after, tying the game with an unassisted goal by Luke Raymond.</p>\n                <p>The Iannantuono to Aquino connection continued to develop later in the frame, as the freshman fed the sophomore for another strong shot to put the Nittany Lions back in front.</p>\n                <p>The score was leveled just seconds before the buzzer sounded when Colin Michener ripped a shot over the top, stinging the top right corner to bring the game into the break at 3-3.</p>\n                <p>Nick Lucchesi scored the Wildcats\u2019 second straight goal early in the second quarter with an on-the-run sidearm shot to give Villanova its first lead of the contest.</p>\n                <p>Soon after, Villanova found the back of the net again when Michener fed Ryan Welgos to grab the first multi-goal lead of the game for either team.</p>\n                <p>Kyle Lehman ended the three-goal run by Villanova when he took a hard dodge past his defender and dunked on Wildcat goaltender Denis Fargione to cut their lead to one.</p>\n                <p>Later in the second quarter, the Villanova lead expanded back to two when Gavin Michener ripped a low shot past Hawkins.</p>\n                <p>Robertson scored his second of the game with just over a minute left in the half, making a nice move past a defender and going bar-down past Fargione.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions proceeded to tie the game with just seconds on the clock when Lehman ripped a shot with his knee on the turf, bringing the matchup into the half tied.</p>\n                <p>Villanova regained the lead just over a minute into the third quarter, with Kessy Cox bouncing one past Hawkins to bring the score to 6-7 in favor of the Wildcats.</p>\n                <p>Iannantuono knotted the game back up with a dodge from behind the cage, rolling in front of the crease and finishing well to even the score at 7-7. Penn State would then take the lead on a big rip from Robertson to secure his hat trick.</p>\n                <p>Another tie was formed when Colin Michener scored his second goal of the game on a close shot late in the third quarter.</p>\n                <p>Jon King, usually a defensive midfielder, drove through several Villanova defenders and found the back of the net to give the Nittany Lions a 9-8 advantage with less than a minute remaining in the frame.</p>\n                <p>Lucchesi scored his second goal of the game for the Wildcats to tie the game yet again.</p>\n                <p>Not long after, Penn State went man-up after a Villanova penalty. Aquino face-dodged around his defender after another feed by Iannantuono to give the blue and white a 10-9 advantage.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions took a rare two-goal lead near the midpoint of the final frame when John Jude Considine went airborne to dunk on the Villanova cage.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started to pull away in the later stages of the fourth quarter, with Andrew Beard tucking a shot into the bottom right corner of the net as he faded away from the goal.</p>\n                <p>Villanova cut the lead to two with Lucchesi securing his hat trick with a low-to-high shot that found the top left corner of the net. They got another with 4:27 remaining in the game when Cox ripped a strong shot from 15 yards out past Hawkins.</p>\n                <p>After being down three goals, the Wildcats came all the way back to tie the game at 12-12 when Dan Martin found the back of the net less than a minute after Villanova\u2019s last score.</p>\n                <p>They then took the lead with their fourth unanswered goal as Raymond wrapped around the crease and sank another goal past Hawkins.</p>\n                <p>With Villanova trying to drain the clock, the Penn State defense forced a turnover and went on a fastbreak, where defenseman Alex Ross wound up heavily and powered a tying goal past Fargione as Holuba Hall\u2019s crowd erupted.</p>\n                <p>Villanova had a good look with just seconds remaining, but Hawkins stayed strong in the cage to deny their chance and send the game to overtime.</p>\n                <p>After winning the opening faceoff, Martin wound up and scored his second goal of the game to walk it off for Villanova.</p>\n                <p>The 14-13 loss moves Penn State to 1-1 on the season, and is the Nittany Lions\u2019 first loss to Villanova since 2023.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Liam Matthews returned to action after not playing in last week\u2019s matchup with Colgate</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will travel to Annapolis for a 12 p.m. matchup with Navy on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Three days after Penn State\u2019s first conference win of the year, it seemed like the team would make it two straight after a strong first half against ranked Michigan State.</p>\n                <p>Despite the first-half hoopla, the Lady Lions lost their 16th game of the year, falling 81-70 to the Spartans.</p>\n                <p>While 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle returned to the injury report despite playing on Wednesday, Penn State had no trouble starting hot against Michigan State.</p>\n                <p>The Spartans struck first out of the gate and exchanged the lead back-and-forth through the opening three minutes of action. However, after five points from Kiyomi McMIller made it a one-point game, she got on fire.</p>\n                <p>Over the next seven minutes of action, McMiller tallied another 11 points, coming to 16 total points in the first quarter. The Lady Lions were up 28-13 while shooting 68% from the field and 60% from deep.</p>\n                <p>On the other hand, the Spartans shot just 30% and 11.1%, respectively, as they fell behind early to the 8-15 Lady Lions.</p>\n                <p>Things got a little better for Michigan State as the second quarter was underway, jumping to a quick 6-0 start with buckets by Jalyn Brown, Emma Shumate and Grace Vanslooten.</p>\n                <p>Penn State fired back with Moriah Murray\u2019s first bucket of the game, but was unable to build any kind of momentum similar to the first period. However, the Spartans\u2019 success continued as they built a 14-5 lead after 10 minutes of play.</p>\n                <p>The final five minutes of action were a back-and-forth battle between both sides as freshman Nyla McFadden got the hot hand, scoring four of Penn State\u2019s 12 points to end the half up 45-33.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions fell apart after McMiller opened the second half with a basket, scoring just seven points total in the period.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State, on the other hand, got going quickly and found sustained success during the quarter. After being down double-digits to enter the period, the Spartans ended the quarter with their first lead since three minutes into the game.</p>\n                <p>After scoring another two straight baskets to start the final period, McMiller found the net again as she totalled 37 points on the day.</p>\n                <p>However, her success wasn\u2019t enough to fuel Penn State as a whole, which had just five other players score.</p>\n                <p>Trailing with 10 minutes left, McMiller worked to bring her team back to the win column for a second straight game. Despite scoring six of the team\u2019s nine buckets in the fourth quarter, the Lady Lions fell for the 16th time this season.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>Penn State hits the road for a Thursday night matchup against Maryland at 7 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A day after Syracuse opened its first season without coach Kayla Treanor with a loss, Penn State had its first game with her at the helm.</p>\n                <p>The Treanor era opened with a close win for the Nittany Lions, who defeated Richmond 10-9 on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s first starting lineup came with a slight surprise to fans, with freshmen Roquette Allen and Lizzie Ann\u00e9 slotting in at attacker ahead of freshman Susannah O'Connell at defense.</p>\n                <p>However, Treanor\u2019s lineup proved fruitful, as the blue and white scored first with Delaney Radin assisting Payton Wainman to take an early lead. The Spiders quickly evened the scoreboard as Keating Hopkins capitalized on a free position shot.</p>\n                <p>Richmond took control of the action through the next seven minutes, picking up three of the four first-quarter ground balls and taking the lead 2-1 with Alexis Morton\u2019s first goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>As the second quarter got underway, junior Sydney Manning faced a lot of pressure in the net after back-to-back shots by the Spiders. Fortunately for Richmond, the second one hit the net as Meghan Rode extended the lead even more.</p>\n                <p>That storyline continued for another few minutes of action as the Spiders, who only had 11 players on the field, took a three-goal lead, courtesy of Rileigh Meyer.</p>\n                <p>However, Allen made the most of her starting lineup position, as she trimmed the deficit with the first goal of her collegiate career. Goal No. 2 from Wainman made it a one-score game halfway through the second period.</p>\n                <p>While Morton\u2019s second goal of the game increased Richmond\u2019s lead, the Nittany Lions tied the game up to end the half with Wainman\u2019s third goal of the game and Emma Kelly\u2019s first.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white opened the third quarter and quickly took the lead for the first time since the beginning of the game as Wainman earned her fourth goal of the game in as many shots.</p>\n                <p>Richmond quickly fought back and held Penn State scoreless for 11 minutes as goalkeeper Abby Francioli recorded a game-high 47.4% save percentage in the net. Morton and Rode each scored another goal, taking the lead 7-6.</p>\n                <p>Allen\u2019s Penn State debut success continued in the end of the third quarter as she scored goal No. 2, tying the game with 10 minutes left.</p>\n                <p>The final period was almost all Penn State, who took the lead early in the fourth quarter after MacKinney\u2019s second goal of the game and Erika Ho\u2019s first. Less than three minutes into the quarter, the Nittany Lions were up by two.</p>\n                <p>While Richmond scored two final goals to end the quarter, midfield transfer Anna Salerno took the blue and white to double-digit goals on the day, ultimately winning 10-9 to open the season 1-0.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions return home to face UMass at 12pm on Wednesday in Holuba Hall.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No commentary on the broadcast, a scorebug that shows the score and nothing else, audio that picks up the crowd\u2019s conversations between innings and only a single fixed camera angle behind home plate.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s fair to say there was limited broadcasting of Penn State\u2019s opening series in Clearwater, Florida, but despite that, the Nittany Lions brought all the shine to the screen Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s play was anything but analog, as it distributed talents all over the field, a team that stumbled below .500 last season and contained many falters started 2026 like Dylan going electric, completely rejuvenated, freshened by new life and ready to make some rumblings.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions started to boogie as soon as they stepped onto the field against Eastern Kentucky: transfer arm McKenna Young, the starter of Friday's season-opening win against Missouri, took the circle and cruised with two punch-outs in the first frame.</p>\n                <p>Coach Clarissa Crowell\u2019s squad carried that tempo with its bats, as it provided the thumps. Leadoff middle infielders Kaylie Walters and Michela Barbanente had the eye of the tiger and smoothly operated to walks, with Walters eventually scoring the first run of the game on an error on the double steal.</p>\n                <p>Penn State needed someone to bring the hammer to fall, and that's precisely what cleanup spot freshman first baseman Kirsten Finarelli did with a single to drive in Barbanente \u2013 she\u2019s now started her career with three straight games with a run driven in.</p>\n                <p>EKU starter Bayle Hunnicutt eventually navigated out of the frame, but so did Young when the side flipped over. Three is the magic number, and the junior easily grooved to retire the side with defensive outs despite allowing her first runner of the game via a walk.</p>\n                <p>When the blue and white bats went out for its second performance of the day, and again the thunder struck, as it bumped Hunnicutt out of the circle. A triad of walks, sac-bunt and continued savvy baserunning flustered the Colonoles\u2019 defense.</p>\n                <p>Rightfielder Cara Bohner scored in the mosh, but the new arm in the circle, Victoria Byrum, ended the inning soon after when the defense didn\u2019t drift away, as it caught Barbanete stealing.</p>\n                <p>Young kept hitting all the right notes, retiring the side in order. Brynum looked to steal the stage, but Penn State\u2019s silver slugger, Brooke Klosowicz, stepped up to the plate. The junior showed that \u201cyou get what you give\u201d when she took a pitch over the plate, gifted to her by Brynum, deep to left field, extending the lead to four in the second straight game she homered.</p>\n                <p>Sadly for the Nittany Lions, they learned the same lesson when the lineup flipped over: Young finally gave up her first hit of the game to EKU, yet a pair of swinging strikeouts sandwiched between a walk eventually ended the fourth inning.</p>\n                <p>The action remained relatively defensive until a single by Jocelyn Owen of EKU and an error by Allison Oneacre at the corner put a runner at third, eventually scoring on a fielder\u2019s choice.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white went down in order for a second straight inning, and Crowell opted for Abigail Britton to enter inside the circle to do the dirty work of closing out the game.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore made her second appearance of the season and earned two quick outs, but an error by Barbanente left one on, and the Colonels soon cashed in on the action with a triple to cut the score to 4-2.</p>\n                <p>The Penn State bats got an opportunity to extend the lead with a Klosowicz encore performance in the batter\u2019s box, after she smacked a double off the wall, yet two defensive outs ended the inning.</p>\n                <p>In the top of the seventh, it was Britton to close out the game, as both teams\u2019 dugouts began to ring up the chants. Last season\u2019s Penn State save leader got a pair of outs courtesy of her defense and followed with a strikeout to secure the win.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State softball resumes action later today, with an opportunity to improve to 4-0 against BYU. The time for the first pitch will be announced on the Penn State softball social media account shortly, with streaming available for free on GameChanger.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Finnish women\u2019s hockey team faced two opponents on Saturday: The United States and norovirus.</p>\n                <p>After falling ill, Finland fell to the United States, 5-0.</p>\n                <p>Team Finland has a later start to the Olympics Winter Games than anticipated when its opening game on Feb. 5 against Canada was postponed while several Finnish players were quarantined while dealing with norovirus.</p>\n                <p>On Friday, Finland practiced with only 11 skaters and three goalies, an improvement from Thursday\u2019s practice with only eight skaters and two goalies.</p>\n                <p>The Fins had a fever, and perhaps the only cure was more discipline. Finland found itself with one less skater on six different circumstances and allowed the United States to score on two of those, one of which put captain Hilary Knight one step closer to the top of the history books.</p>\n                <p>The American captain scored on a shot adjacent to the cage and scored on the short side to the right of Ahola. It was her second goal of the Olympics, but more notably, the 14th of her Olympic career, which put her in a tie with Natalie Darwitz and Katie King for the most career goals in the USA\u2019s women\u2019s hockey history.</p>\n                <p>Team USA drew two minor infractions in the opening period, the first roughly five minutes in when Michelle Karvinen was called for holding the stick against Abbey Murphy. The Americans had a few opportunities, but ultimately couldn\u2019t capitalize.</p>\n                <p>Penn State captain Tessa Janecke had two assists in Thursday\u2019s match against Czechia, catching the eyes of the nation with the first two points of her Olympic career.</p>\n                <p>Janecke also caught the eyes of the official when she was brought down with a hook by Susanna Tapani with under five minutes remaining in the first period. After not taking advantage of its first man-advantage the United States only needed seven seconds to get on the board first.</p>\n                <p>Following the offensive zone draw, Laila Edwards sent a backhanded pass out of reach of a trio of Finnish skaters to Alex Carpenter who ripped a quick snap shot for her second goal of the Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>After drawing the penalty that led to the United States\u2019 first goal, Janecke nearly extended its lead with a minute left in the first period, but was denied at the doorstep by Finland\u2019s goaltender Sanni Ahola.</p>\n                <p>Team USA came out to open the second period looking even better than it did in the first. The red, white and blue scored twice within the first four minutes, with the two goals being scored only 1:26 apart.</p>\n                <p>Murphy, Britta Curl and Taylor Heise entered their offensive zone in a 3-on-1 and displayed a perfect tic-tac-toe performance that resulted in Heise finding the back of the net on a cross-crease feed from Murphy.</p>\n                <p>Moments later, Megan Keller made a simple move and navigated her way around the circumference of the far-side faceoff circle and found a gap in the five-hole of Ahola to put the United States up 3-0.</p>\n                <p>Ronja Savolainen took the third penalty for Finland, a two-minute minor for holding against Kendall Coyne Schofield that led to Knight putting herself in a three-way tie for history.</p>\n                <p>Janecke had a few opportunities to help extend the United States\u2019 lead late in the second period. Skating on a 2-on-1 with Murphy, the pass from the Golden Gopher was blocked by Finland\u2019s Nelli Laitinen who was laid out on the ice.</p>\n                <p>That same shift, Janecke and Murphy found themselves in the same situation with flipped responsibilities. Janecke\u2019s pass got through the legs of a Finnish skater, but Murphy failed at her attempt to stop the puck with her skate.</p>\n                <p>While the offense fired on all cylinders, the defense also pressed its thumb on Finland, and made the game as easy as it could for Aerin Frankel, who stopped all nine shots she faced through the first 40 minutes of play.</p>\n                <p>Despite holding a four-goal lead, the Americans continued to play with an attacking offense compared to a conservative defense. The results showed in the second half of the final period, when the United States prevented a shot on goal from Finland until there was roughly eight minutes remaining in regulation.</p>\n                <p>Frankel only faced 12 shots in her shutout compared to the 49 Ahola faced, with the one of the final shots serving as a goal from Murphy that capped off the United States\u2019s scoring.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The United States will continue the preliminary round against Switzerland, the newest team to deal with the norovirus, at 2:40 p.m. EST on Monday.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPIC COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "QBs coach Jake Waters could've transferred to Penn State 14 years ago, now he's back",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When Jake Waters transferred out of Iowa Western Community College in 2012, the quarterback visited Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Waters was \u201cblown away\u201d by that visit, but he ultimately transferred to Kansas State. Now, he\u2019s back in Happy Valley as the team\u2019s quarterbacks coach, and even though it\u2019s been over a decade since he was recruited, the Nittany Lions have stayed on his mind.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEver since that visit, I've always had my eye on Penn State,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI would always watch them and have a special place in my heart, even though obviously I wouldn't trade my time at (Kansas) State and with coach (Bill) Snyder for the world and my guys that I met there and the experiences I had, but I always knew this was a really special place.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Waters threw for 5,970 yards, 40 touchdowns and 16 interceptions across two seasons with the Wildcats from 2013-14. He made brief stints with the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Seattle Seahawks during the 2015 offseason, but he never appeared in an NFL game.</p>\n                <p>He then spent a season in the CFL, playing for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2016.</p>\n                <p>Waters jumped into the coaching industry following his playing career. His hiring at Penn State was made official on Dec. 18, and he said it\u2019s been a \u201cdream come true\u201d to be back in State College.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's been incredible,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThe people around here are incredible. And then the people I get to work with every day are guys that I love and trust. The players have been awesome, too, but a cool, personal, full circle moment on being here for a weekend and then kind of going somewhere else, but then coming in and being back here. It's been really exciting. It's been awesome.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Waters first joined a Matt Campbell staff when he was a graduate assistant with Iowa State in 2017 after a season as a volunteer assistant at Iowa Western. He had a three-year stop at UTEP as wide receivers coach, and Waters returned to the Cyclones in 2021.</p>\n                <p>In 2024, Waters was promoted to quarterbacks coach at Iowa State, where he guided quarterback Rocco Becht, who\u2019s now the projected starter for Penn State next season. Waters made the jump from Ames, Iowa, to Happy Valley with numerous other coaches, and he called it a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to rejoin Campbell.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's almost like we just picked up our offensive staff room and just moved it to State College,\u201d Waters said. \u201cIt made it really, really easy and comfortable. Obviously, we know we're gonna have to change and adapt, different conference, different opponents, different environment, all that. But we\u2019re really, really excited for the challenge.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Waters said he was \u201cthankful\u201d for Campbell to give him the opportunity to be quarterbacks coach at Penn State. He said he knew Campbell had to do \u201cwhat\u2019s best for him\u201d when building his first staff with the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Waters has coached at the junior college level, Conference USA and the Big 12. Now, he has the chance to coach in the Big Ten, which he called a \u201cgreat challenge,\u201d and with the team he was once a potential recruit.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou're playing in some awesome environments, you're playing some awesome schools, and you get to coach at an awesome school, at the best school,\u201d Waters said. \u201cIt's a great challenge. It'll be awesome to roll and go through it. Obviously, there's no one else I'd rather take that challenge on with coach Campbell and our guys and the staff.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | Penn State wrestling used dual against Michigan as training with varied approach",
    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Penn State wrestling defeated Michigan in dominating fashion by a score of 38-3, but found itself making different decisions and in interesting situations.</p>\n                <p>Some of the moves and decisions shown haven\u2019t been made before, or as often as they were in Friday\u2019s dual. It became more clear as the dual went on that the wrestlers and coaching staff were testing out some things.</p>\n                <p>The main catalyst to this is the neutral position. Penn State almost always chooses to go bottom when it has the decision to start the period. Multiple times on Friday the Nittany Lions chose to go neutral, essentially foregoing a point.</p>\n                <p>It started with Luke Lilledahl, who had a big lead, choosing to go neutral in the second period and ultimately ended up winning by tech fall in dominating fashion. The neutral position allowed him to get to his offense quickly, something that could be a reason why the decision was made.</p>\n                <p>The next time it happened was at 157 pounds. PJ Duke was leading 7-6 entering the third period and had a point sitting right in front of him if he chose to go on the bottom, barring he\u2019d escape during the two minute frame.</p>\n                <p>Just like Lilledahl, Duke came out victorious but not without another sign of testing things. Late in the match, the Nittany Lion gave up a takedown to Cameron Catrabone, giving the Wolverine a lead. But, Duke immediately escaped, and in one motion, took down Catrabone to retake the lead. He made this movement look effortless and almost like he had been holding back.</p>\n                <p>The conceded takedown made it seem that Duke was done messing around and finished things off to get the win.</p>\n                <p>Two matches later, Levi Haines made the same decision to go neutral. His decision seemed pre-determined as he looked to bench while signaling for neutral. Josh Barr made the same decision to go neutral and won big, just as Haines did.</p>\n                <p>These matches also came with some precarious positions. Multiple times, Penn State wrestlers ended up in wild scrambles and were on their backs for split seconds. Luckily for the Nittany Lions, their skillset allowed them to come out on top more times than not in these mad scrambles. Penn State is testing things and changing things up against the No. 10 team in the country and still found ultra success.</p>\n                <p>The neutral position is definitely an interesting tactic. On one hand, Penn State is giving up the potential escape point, but is immediately giving its wrestlers a chance to score on a takedown.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions remain miles ahead of their competition with the biggest test coming next week against No. 2 Ohio State. Whether Penn State chooses to use the neutral tactic against the Buckeyes won\u2019t be known until Friday, but one thing\u2019s for certain, it specifically chose this dual to test it out, with four different wrestlers choosing neutral and still winning.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>All three current Nittany Lions won their first Olympic game with their respective country on Thursday. A quick turnaround followed the players as they only had a day's rest until they hit the ice for their second game in Italy.</p>\n                <p>Two current Penn State teammates found themselves on opposite ends of the ice for the first time in the Olympics as Matilde Fantin, representing Italy, went against Nicole Hall, skating for Sweden. While former Nittany Lion Jessica Adolfsson joined Hall on Team Sweden.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLet the best woman win,\u201d Hall said regarding her matchup against Fantin.</p>\n                <p>While the two countries will meet again in the Olympics, it was Adolfsson and Hall who got the first laugh as Team Sweden used a three-goal second period for a 6-1 win over Team Italy.</p>\n                <p>Fantin had her name called early as she made her way through the offensive zone with speed. She quickly found herself in the slot where she met a defenseman\u2019s stick. This led to a violent trip to the boards for Fantin.</p>\n                <p>The Como, Italy, native slowly made her way to the bench immediately after the collision and was seen grimacing in pain as her left collarbone area was being checked on. She later returned to the ice on her following shift.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden opened the scoring nearly 10 minutes into the game. Adolfsson ripped a slap shot from the left faceoff circle that found the back of the net in an instant. It was the Landeryd, Sweden, native\u2019s first goal in her second Olympics.</p>\n                <p>The puck seemed to follow Sweden after its first goal as they played with heightened aggression. The group forced multiple turnovers in its offensive zone, leading to quick scoring chances, ultimately ending with no additional goals.</p>\n                <p>Team Italy\u2019s best chance of the first period came with under two minutes to play. After a forced turnover at the blue line, Marta Mazzocchi fed a pass to Manuela Heidenberger, who found herself behind the defense. The Bolzano, Italy, native moved in on her forehand, but was shut down by the left pad of Ebba Svensson Traff.</p>\n                <p>The opening period came to a close after a late penalty from Italy gave Sweden a power play. With no goal in the remaining 90 seconds, Sweden started the second period on the man advantage.</p>\n                <p>Momentum from its opening power play carried with Team Sweden as it continued to apply pressure in hopes of getting two on the scoreboard. The Swedish offense was able to get going due to the defense not allowing a shot on net from Italy until under 11 minutes left in the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>Sweden dominated in the shot department, finishing with 48 to Italy\u2019s 18.</p>\n                <p>After spending almost all of the first 10 minutes in the offensive zone, Sweden finally found the net. Sofie Lundin went end-to-end and shot a wrister from the top of the faceoff circle.</p>\n                <p>Only two minutes later, a turnover in the neutral zone led to Sara Hjalmarsson entering the offensive zone with speed. With no defenseman in front of her, Hjalmarsson sent a quick wrist shot that found the net.</p>\n                <p>Italy found its way on the scoreboard late in the second period after Franziska Stocker sent a rocket at the net from the point. However, it didn\u2019t take long for Sweden to answer, as just over a minute passed before it could get its fourth goal of the game. Hanna Olsson sniped a shot from the slot that made its way to the net.</p>\n                <p>Team Italy had the first scoring chance of the third period as a quick two-on-one opportunity was turned aside by Svensson Traff.</p>\n                <p>A quick turnover in its own zone from Italy gave Sweden a quality scoring chance. Thea Johansson didn\u2019t waste time with the opportunity as she went five-hole giving Sweden its fifth goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>Johansson wasn\u2019t done there as she joined a two-on-one rush with Olsson. She quickly received the pass and elevated it over the left pad of Gabriella Durante.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden completely took momentum at the start of the second period and didn\u2019t give it up</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Sweden will look to continue its successful start against France at 10:40 a.m. EST on Sunday. Fantin and Team Italy will look to rebound against Japan at 6:10 a.m. EST on Monday.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPIC COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Caroline Riley | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Despite three straight 196.000+ scores to open the season for Penn State, taking on the No. 3 LSU Tigers on the road in Baton Rouge on Friday Night Heights is unlike any challenge the Nittany Lions have faced this season.</p>\n                <p>Unable to put together its best meet to challenge the 2023 National Champion LSU Tigers, the blue and white lost 196.125-197.525.</p>\n                <p>However, despite a loss in the head-to-head matchup, Penn State could potentially use the performance as an away score in the NQS calculation.</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>Penn State got off to a slow start on the uneven bars, unfortunately unable to hit the 49.000+ mark.</p>\n                <p>Ellie Monahan got the Nittany Lions off to a strong start. She was aggressive, going for her handstands, needing a large arch in her back before dismount, but took just a small hop on her full twisting double back for a 9.700.</p>\n                <p>Jessica Johanson had a nice routine on the bars themselves and almost stuck her double layout, but had to take a step forward, which lowered her score to a matching 9.700. Elizabeth Leary turned the tide, got the sticks started, and scored the rotation\u2019s first 9.800+ score in the third slot. She managed a strong 9.850 courtesy of a stuck full-twisting double back.</p>\n                <p>Ava Cash kept the momentum going. The freshman had a fingertip catch on her piked jaeger but put together a beautifully clean routine, featuring a stuck dismount, for a rotation-high 9.875. Ava Piedrahita had a solid routine on the bars but was unable to maintain that control through the end, needing a big hop back on her dismount for a 9.750.</p>\n                <p>Dani Latronica was a little shy on her bail handstand and took a small hop on her dismount as well, but finished the rotation strong with a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>On the vault, LSU did its usual, including yet another stick from star sophomore Kailin Chio on her Yurchenko 1.5. LSU took an early lead, 49.475-48.975.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>The Nittan Lions\u2019 struggles continued on fault as they once again failed to score enough 9.800+ scores to get above a 49.000+</p>\n                <p>Leary nailed it in the leadoff position, practically sticking her Yurchenko full for a 9.750. Cash followed it up with an almost identical landing, taking just a small hop. Her increased height and strong form improved her score to a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Allison Kaempfer has Penn State\u2019s only 10.0 start value. She overrotated her Yurchenko 1.5, taking a big hop and step for a low 9.675. Despite a different fault, Latronica had a similar landing issue. Piking down, she took a large deduction on the landing for a 9.625.</p>\n                <p>Johanson got the team back on track with a solid Yurchenko full. She took just a small hope for an improved 9.800. Piedrahita anchored with the best vault of the rotation. She took just a small hop, but got massive height for a 9.775.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State had some shaky landings on the vault, LSU kept its momentum going on bars, extending its lead 98.750-97.750</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Leary led off in a big way for Penn State with a huge 9.850. She controlled all of her tumbling in an effort to get the Nittany Lions on track to bounce back after two low rotations.</p>\n                <p>Monahan kept the momentum going. She stuck her final pass and managed to control her leaps for a 9.825, the type of score Penn State needed if it wanted a chance to cut down LSU\u2019s lead.</p>\n                <p>Bella Misiura opened with a clean front double full. The sophomore finished with a front full to layout that she stuck cold for another 9.825. Johanson opened with a big double pike. She had a bit of an uncontrolled hop on her final pass, which dropped her score to a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Kramer built off Johanson with a big front double full to start. She nailed the rest of her routine for a big 9.875. Kalea McElligott opened with a double tuck but took a small shuffle with her front foot in the lunge, which is a deduction, lowering her score to a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Despite some early wobbles on the beam for LSU and a strong floor rotation for the Nittany Lions, they were unable to cut down the lead as they trailed the Tigers 146.925-147.975.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Despite having basically no chance to beat LSU heading into beam as the final rotation, Penn State had to focus on its national average and put up a strong final rotation to do so.</p>\n                <p>Monahan was calm and confident in the leadoff position. She had no wobbles on the beam, but underrotated her dismount a bit, taking a small hop back for a 9.750.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Maul, in her first appearance of the night, delivered a big 9.850. She was solid on the beam like Monahon but managed to stick her dismount.</p>\n                <p>McElligott showcased her strong triple series. She could not quite hold on to the landing on the dismount, but matched Maul\u2019s 9.850 with one of her own.</p>\n                <p>Amani Herring opened with a front toss-backhandspring combo, which she kept moving despite a small adjustment.

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Three decades in Happy Valley, over 900 career games coached, with almost all of the Penn State men\u2019s volleyball program record book written via accolades he\u2019s earned with his teams throughout the way \u2013 Mark Pavlik is a bona fide Penn State legend.</p>\n                <p>Might as well commission his spot on the S. Allen Street mural now.</p>\n                <p>Yet, before the Penn State faithful get to that, the Nittany Lions have a chance to send Pavlik off into retirement with nothing but pride in the rearview mirror, but on that conquest, they have staggered to an even 4-4 start.</p>\n                <p>However, Pavlik and Co. get a look at an excellent opportunity to turn around that start and faltering form when it welcomes one of the bosses\u2019 most familiar foes throughout his tenure \u2013 Saint Francis, led by its winningest coach of all time and of several decades, Mike Rumbaugh.</p>\n                <p>The Red Flash and the Nittany Lions met over 50 times in their program\u2019s history, almost all of which during Pavlik\u2019s and Rumbuagh\u2019s tenures, and the results lean almost entirely in the blue and white\u2019s favor, 54-3 all-time.</p>\n                <p>While there's familiarity in the matchup with success for Pavlik, and that\u2019s precisely how the 2026 edition went, with the Nittany Lions cruising to a three set sweep. There\u2019s also a new shakeup in the matchup \u2013 it\u2019s the first time Rumbuagh\u2019s squad stepped into Rec Hall at the DIII Level and as a member of its new league, the NEC.</p>\n                <p>For this unique version of a clash of familiar foes, Pavlik sent out his own group of usuals, with typical starters Jaxon Herr, Ryan Merk, Jaidyn Bethel, Gaige Gabriel, Sean Harvey, Owen Rose and Matthew Luoma to complete the first unit.</p>\n                <p>That group battled back and forth with the Red Flash as the two traded kills and minimal errors to a 6-6 first set.</p>\n                <p>Penn State then pulled ahead via an eight-point scoring streak, highlighted by a Bethel ace. The rest of the set resembled the start, as the two units traded kills and service errors to a 25-20 Penn State advantage \u2013 the closest the first frame finished since a 2023 extra points first set.</p>\n                <p>The second frame looked to contain more optimism for the Nittany Lions, as a pair of kills and a Red Flash attack error via a Harvey block got the blue and white out to an early 3-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>However, that fine lead was all Penn State maintained throughout the second set, as the Nittany Lions exchanged blows throughout its duration. The blue and white logged a second ace of the match to pull ahead 14-13, this time courtesy of Gabriel, and it boosted their momentum.</p>\n                <p>Harvey notched a kill, Saint Francis blundered two of its attacks and Tristan Hassell put up a big block to pull the blue and white 22-16.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offense stayed hot, as Hassell logged a kill to put the Nittany Lions at set point, and then, after a group of Pavlik substitutions, they finished the job. Herr launched a serve over the net, and when the ball came back, the Nittany Lions struck on the opportunity, as the senior assisted Harvey on the set-clinching kill.</p>\n                <p>Entering the third set, Saint Francis\u2019s Brady Stump logged a match-high eight kills, but also posted five errors, while Penn State had a much more team attack, as four logged three or more kills. Harvey led the blue and white with four errors and five kills \u2013 tied with Luoma.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started the third set with another Harvey kill, and then Herr joined in on the fun, as he logged a pair of kills, a pair of assists and an assist on a Gabriel block, which boosted the blue and white to an 8-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>Saint Francis clawed back with a triad of kills, but Penn State still became the first to reach double-digits, as it drew closer to a sweep with a 14-7 lead.</p>\n                <p>Saint Francis cut the deficit to six as the Nittany Lions approached 20 points, and a pair of Bethel kills extended the Nittany Lions' lead closer to victory.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, the blue and white used its momentum to take down the Red Flash, despite a four-point stretch in which they narrowed the lead to 23-18 and forced Pavlik to call a timeout.</p>\n                <p>Bethel made it match point after the break, and a Luoma kill eventually sealed the deal.</p>\n                <p>Harvey finished with a team-high nine kills and a team-high 11 points, while Herr finished with a game-high 21 assists.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The blue and white continue its series against Saint Francis, this time on the opposition\u2019s turf, as it stays in the Commonwealth with a trip to Loretto to face the Red Flash at DeGol Arena.</p>\n                <p>Streaming is available at 6 p.m. on NEC Front Row.</p>",

    "description": "<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Penn State showed up and showed out in Crisler Arena. The Nittany Lions continued their dominance with a 38-3 win against Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got five tech falls, and seemed to be in control for many of the matches. Nate Desmond and PJ Duke had comeback wins after being down in both of their matches, but both were able to prevail.</p>\n                <p>125 Pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs No. 26 Diego Sotelo (MICH)</p>\n                <p>After a bit of hand fighting back-and-forth, Luke Lilledahl was the first to get a takedown. When Diego Sotelo attempted to get up, the sophomore slammed him back down on the mat. Sotelo eventually got up, but was taken down twice more to take a 9-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl started in neutral and took down Sotelo immediately. Sotelo started to show some life when he secured a reversal, but it was answered by Lilledahl\u2019s sixth takedown of the match.</p>\n                <p>The match ended with a Lilledahl reversal to win 21-5 by tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 5-0.</p>\n                <p>133 Pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs Gauge Botero (MICH)</p>\n                <p>After a slow start to the match, Marcus Blaze got things started with a takedown. The freshman got over a minute of riding time, another takedown and four near-fall points to end the period up 10-1.</p>\n                <p>Gauge Botero was able to get Blaze to under a minute of riding time, but the Perrysburg, Ohio, native escaped and then secured his third takedown of the match. Blaze let Botero up and then took him down immediately to get a 17-2 tech fall victory late in the second period.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 10-0.</p>\n                <p>141 Pounds: Nate Desmond (PSU) vs No. 26 Dylan Ragusin (MICH)</p>\n                <p>Nate Desmond got the call and was close to securing a takedown in the first period, but Dylan Ragusin didn\u2019t let it happen and guarded it well. The first period was notched up at 0-0.</p>\n                <p>Ragusin escaped from Desmond early and continued to show strong defense until Desmond got a hold of his leg and got the takedown. Ragusin got awarded a stall point and the reversal and took a 4-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>Desmond was on another level in the third period with a reversal after slamming Regusin on the mat. Ragusin was able to escape to tie the match at five.</p>\n                <p>Desmond got the takedown in sudden victory to get the 8-5 as he wrapped around Ragusin and threw him down on the mat. Penn State leads 13-0.</p>\n                <p>149: Pounds: No. 4 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs No. 13 Lachlan McNeil (MICH)</p>\n                <p>These two last wrestled at the NCAA championships, with the outcome being in Shayne Van Ness\u2019s favor. After the first period, neither wrestler was able to find the score sheet.</p>\n                <p>Lachlan McNeil escaped first and gave Van Ness a point for illegal touch to the back of the head. The junior then got the takedown and was on top of McNeil for the rest of the period.</p>\n                <p>McNeil got two stalling calls, which awarded Van Ness a point and the junior built off that with a takedown to take an 8-1 lead. With the riding time, Van Ness gets the major decision victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 17-0.</p>\n                <p>157 Pounds: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs No. 13 Cameron Catrabone (MICH)</p>\n                <p>Cameron Catrabone got the action started with an early takedown, but Duke escaped. After a stoppage for potential injury, Duke was on top and Catrabone got his fourth point of the period. Catrabone ended the period on top 4-1.</p>\n                <p>Catrabone got the escape to start the second, but Duke started to get aggressive and took Catrabone down soon after. The freshman continued to lead the charge and took a 7-6 lead going into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Catrabone got the takedown and Duke immediately escaped, got a takedown of his own to take an 11-9 lead. Catrabone escaped and with riding time, Duke got the victory 12-10.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 20-0.</p>\n                <p>165 Pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs Justin Gates (MICH)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink started with a takedown in the opening 30 seconds and another one a minute later to take a 6-1 lead.</p>\n                <p>To start the middle frame, Mesenbrink got a reversal and continued to be on top of Justin Gates, who eventually escaped, and then got taken down by the junior. Mesenbrink got his fourth takedown to take a 14-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>The third frame started in neutral and Mesenbrink took Gates down twice and got the 20-5 tech fall victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 25-0.</p>\n                <p>174 Pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs No. 11 Beau Mantanona (MICH)</p>\n                <p>A lot of back-and-forth action between Levi Haines and Beau Mantanona, with Haines getting the takedown after Mantanona almost had his leg for a takedown. The senior continued to control the match and led 6-1.</p>\n                <p>Haines continued to be on top in the second with another takedown and over two minutes of riding time.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions continued to take a neutral starting position. Haines secured three more takedowns to get the 19-4 tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 30-0.</p>\n                <p>184 Pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs No. 7 Brock Mantanona (MICH)</p>\n                <p>The match started with hand fighting between the two until Rocco Welsh grabbed Brock Mantanona\u2019s leg and got him down on the mat to score the first points of the match.</p>\n                <p>Welsh escaped to extend his lead to 4-0. The sophomore also added over a minute of riding time.</p>\n                <p>Mantanona got his first escape of the match to lessen the lead to 4-1, but with the riding time, and a late takedown, Welsh got the victory, 8-1.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads 33-0.</p>\n                <p>197 Pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs No. 20 Hayden Walters (MICH)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr scored the only points of the first period with a takedown on Hayden Walters. Barr added a second takedown in the second period. Walters was called for his first stalling call of the match, and Barr added his third takedown to take a 9-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Barr added another takedown and got a stalling point due to Walters being inactive. The sophomore continued to score more takedowns with another one with 35 seconds left in the final frame.</p>\n                <p>Barr gets his sixth takedown of the match and the tech fall victory 19-4, extending Penn State\u2019s lead 38-0.</p>\n                <p>285 Pounds: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs No. 5 Taye Ghadiali (MICH)</p>\n                <p>It was a stalemate between the two heavyweights and Cole Mirasola had a chance to secure points, but was unable to get Taye Ghadiali on the ground, something we\u2019ve seen earlier this season.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola started on the bottom and struggled to get up as Ghadali tossed and turned Mirasola all over the mat. Mirasola eventually escaped and almost got another takedown, but it was Ghadali who got the takedown and the lead 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Ghadali escaped, and Mirasola continued to make attempts to take Ghadali down, but couldn\u2019t get the job done. It looked like, at the end, that Mirasola could\u2019ve been awarded a takedown, but it wasn\u2019t called.</p>\n                <p>Penn State gets the win 38-3.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>While the snow fell in State College, No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey avoided the poor Pennsylvania weather with a trip to Missouri for the final road series of the 2025-26 regular season against the Lindenwood Lions.</p>\n                <p>In an eventful five-goal first period, Danica Maynard recorded four points and was one of four different goal scorers in what was a 6-3 win over the Lions in Penn State\u2019s 20th conference win of the season, a new AHA record</p>\n                <p>The freshman defenseman now has 30 points this season, and it is her second four-point performance she has recorded this season</p>\n                <p>Perhaps the blue and white dealt with some jet lag following their flight to Missouri, as they allowed a goal just 2:23 into the game. Just the eighth time Penn State has allowed its opponent to score first and has done so in back-to-back games.</p>\n                <p>Lindenwood\u2019s Zsofia Pazmandi performed a toe drag to evade defenseman Grace Tullock and got a shot off. Katie DeSa made the initial save, but Pazmandi jumped on her own rebound to put the Lions up early.</p>\n                <p>That goal sparked something in the Nittany Lions' offense.</p>\n                <p>Only 28 seconds after going down 1-0, Maynard picked up the puck at her own blue line and skated up the far side boards in front of the benches, split two Lions skaters, and fired a shot off of Lindenwood goaltender Lexington Secreto. Grace Outwater put the rebound in on a wide-open net to knot the game at one.</p>\n                <p>Outwater has scored in each of her last eight games with 11 total points in that stretch.</p>\n                <p>From there, Penn State\u2019s offense continued to spearhead its attack down Lindenwood\u2019s throat and added three more goals to score four unanswered goals within the first ten minutes of action.</p>\n                <p>Maynard would soon be awarded for her efforts on Penn State\u2019s first goal after Pazmandi was assessed a two-minute minor penalty for interference.</p>\n                <p>After a successful clear from Lindenwood, the Nittany Lions drove their way back into their offensive zone. After a few give-and-gos with Kendall Butze, Maynard crept in from the blue line to the top of the slot and sent the puck pass from Katelyn Roberts through traffic to put the blue and white up 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Roberts continued the trend set by Maynard of assisting on one goal and scoring on the next. After a two-minute scoring break, Roberts caught a pass the length of half the ice from Butze and fed a centering pass to Mya Vaslet, who was brought down on a trip.</p>\n                <p>No power play needed for the senior winger as she picked up the puck after Secreto\u2019s save, transferred to her backhand and slid the puck past the goal line to put Penn State up 3-1.</p>\n                <p>Following a faceoff in the defensive zone, Maynard showed off her speed the entire length of the ice and delivered a cross-crease pass to Maddy Christian, which capped off the Penn State scoring in the opening period.</p>\n                <p>After allowing four goals on seven shots, coach Taylor Wasylk pulled Secreto for Madison Bowtell.</p>\n                <p>Showing no discouragement of a 4-1 deficit, Lindenwood\u2019s offense challenged DeSa and the Penn State defense early in the second period, including a 2-on-1 only 30 seconds in.</p>\n                <p>Despite a challenging first period, the blue and white continued their scoring spree in the second period, just a minute after Lindenwood\u2019s scoring opportunity.</p>\n                <p>Abby Stonehouse blocked a shot with her skate and deflected the puck into the Nittany Lions\u2019 offensive zone. Stonehouse and Robert\u2019s combined presence forced Lindenwood to keep the puck in its own defensive zone. Taylor Lum deked around a skater and delivered a pass to McKenna Walsh, who easily tapped it between the legs of Bowtell.</p>\n                <p>Just over six minutes into the second period, the black and gold finally found the reward they were searching for.</p>\n                <p>After forcing a turnover at the blue line on a poke check against Stonehouse, Paige Cline cut to the net on a 2-on-1 with Molly Henderson. Henderson set a screen on Butze, allowing Cline to put one past the blocker of DeSa and cut the deficit to 5-2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State nearly answered just moments after, but the sophomore goaltender Bowtell made an impressive save to prevent the Nittany Lions from flipping the momentum.</p>\n                <p>Lum continued to play with a crash-the-net style with passes to the crease. Lum created another scoring opportunity with this style, which led to Shelby Shane scoring her first collegiate goal, the sixth of the evening for Penn State</p>\n                <p>Despite trailing 6-2, Lindenwood continued to play as though it were ahead. While skating at 4-on-4, Tatiana Blichova sent a pass off the glass to Henderson, who dragged the puck around Tullock for a shot on goal. DeSa lost the puck behind her, and it was poked in by Josey Dunne-Weeks to cut the Penn State lead in half.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions continued to dominate, but it was Bowtell who dominated in the crease. The 5-foot-5-inch netminder stopped all 11 shots she faced in the third period and made 29 saves on 31 shots in the loss.</p>\n                <p>Bowtell stood tall on multiple 2-on-1 cross-crease opportunities, and capped off her third-period performance with a highlight-reel worthy save on a breakaway from Outwater.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions improved to 27-4 and will play in their final road match of the regular season at 2 p.m. on Saturday against Lindenwood.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State hosts USC for the first time in Happy Valley, and in the place it calls home, the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>It completes a weird week for the Nittany Lions, from a buzzer-beater against Minnesota for their first conference win, to destruction in Ann Arbor at the hands of No. 2 Michigan and now, when it faces a squad with little shared history.</p>\n                <p>Given that trend, there are a few ways to make sense of the upcoming matchup, as the prevailing narratives surrounding both squads are hard to ignore.</p>\n                <p>Stats and player personnel</p>\n                <p>If there\u2019s any way to tell a quick story for a game, it\u2019s in the statsheet, and that\u2019s where many of USC\u2019s storylines persist.</p>\n                <p>Top-3 conference turnover numbers, a bottom-5 Big Ten defense, and three-point shooting percentage and tied for most fouls per game in the league, headline those worrying overall trends for the gold and cardinal.</p>\n                <p>The one area where USC excels is in possession metrics, as they\u2019re currently a top-35 team in the nation in possessions per game, a stat in which the blue and white struggled all year long.</p>\n                <p>In the Trojans\u2019 clash against Indiana, despite a win that improved USC to 17-6 on the year, and an even in the Big Ten after 12 games, a lot of those glaring issues weren\u2019t addressed, but rather patched up with a band-aid in the form of freshman Alijah Arenas.</p>\n                <p>Son of three-time NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas, and a top-10 player in the 2025 recruiting class, the 6-foot-6 guard had all eyes on him when he entered college ball, before he suffered a tragic car accident and a torn meniscus, which sidelined him for months. Arenas made his return in the last few weeks and, against the Hoosiers, dropped a career-high 29 points as he began to find his footing.</p>\n                <p>For a Trojans squad that has a lot of questions looming, a player like Arenas could be the final key to turning around those doubts, and at the very least, fill holes in the lineup that's recently opened.</p>\n                <p>Injuries</p>\n                <p>Both the Trojans and the Nittany Lions had their own share of injury problems over the last couple of weeks \u2013 a factor that could rear its ugly head on Sunday. In their previous contest, the tip of that iceberg already began to emerge, as Penn State played without its size, with international big men Ivan Juri\u0107, Sas\u01ce Ciani and Tibor Mirti\u0107 sidelined. Joining that group is the only Nittany Lions sharpshooter to post a three-point percentage greater than 40%, Eli Rice.</p>\n                <p>That lack of physicality handicapped a squad that had to rely on freshman 7-footer Justin Houser, still wet behind the ears, and the blue and white stumbled to a 44-21 disadvantage on the glass against Michigan, as the Wolverines consistently found easy inside buckets. From beyond the arc, the blue and white shot a disastrous 2-for-20, without Rice\u2019s clip present.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades provided limited insight in his weekly media availability on whether anyone from that group would return. However, Juri\u0107 and Rice appear more likely, as their ailments\u2014a fever and an accidental head collision\u2014seem less severe than Ciani\u2019s ankle issues or Mirti\u0107\u2019s shoulder injury, which had been seen in a sling.</p>\n                <p>For the Southern California competitors, they\u2019ve been nagged just as bad, if not worse, because of absences. USC\u2019s star forward Chad Baker-Mazara missed the Trojans\u2019 last game against Indiana, and a Feb 5 MRI revealed he\u2019s battling a Grade 1 knee strain that leads him to be day-to-day ahead of the weekend clash with the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Baker-Mazara joins Rodney Rice, who averaged over 20 points per game over his six appearances this year before a late November injury ended his season, and senior wing Amarion Dickerson, who is out for several months due to a hip injury.</p>\n                <p>Heading into Happy Valley, ESPN predicts that USC has a little under 70% chance of a win, and while the sportsbooks haven\u2019t officially opened for the game yet, it\u2019s likely Vegas agrees with that sentiment.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will likely be heavy underdogs and given a double-digit point spread. This year, the blue and white are 1-12 when opening in that predicament and 1-5 as the dog at home. Against the spread, however, Penn State is 4-2 as a home underdog and 6-7 overall against the spread when the opponent is favored.</p>\n                <p>Tipoff is set at noon Sunday at noon with streaming available on the Big Ten Network.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Coming off a thrilling 7-4 extra innings win over Missouri in its season opener, Penn State faced Boston College in the second game of its doubleheader on Friday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions displayed pitching excellence and carried their offensive momentum into this game, picking up the shutout win over the Eagles, 7-0.</p>\n                <p>After junior Bridget Nemeth closed the door and picked up the win in the blue and white\u2019s last game, coach Clarisa Crowell gave her the start against the Eagles. While senior Halie Pappion got the task to face the Nittany Lions\u2019 lineup after they started rolling late against Missouri.</p>\n                <p>It didn\u2019t take long for Penn State to strike on offense as the blue and white carried its momentum right into this game early in the first. Junior Michela Barbanente reached base on a one-out walk and then swiped second base for her first steal of the campaign. With a runner already in scoring position, junior star Brooke Klosowicz picked up right where she left off last season.</p>\n                <p>The slugger powered a two-run home run deep over the left field fence, giving the Nittany Lions an early 2-0 lead. While Penn State threatened again with a few runners later in the inning, Pappion minimized the damage and allowed no more runs.</p>\n                <p>The hot bats continued in the second, pressuring Pappion into escaping another jam. Senior Madison Seidel led off with a triple dropped into right center and freshman Breanna Hanik followed with a walk.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions stayed aggressive on the base paths early, as Hanik swiped second base and set Penn State up with runners on second and third. However, Pappion settled and got out the next three blue and white batters, which prevented any runs.</p>\n                <p>Despite a productive first few innings for the blue and white, the bats settled down. Yet, Nemeth was plowing through the Eagles\u2019 lineup and allowed no runs. The Glendora, California, native threw a dominant three scoreless innings, surrendering just one hit and one walk.</p>\n                <p>Since Nemeth already pitched 2.1 innings in the earlier doubleheader game, Crowell turned to her bullpen at the start of the fourth and brought in freshman Mackenzie Duncan. The Winter Garden, Florida, native ran into some trouble when Boston College had a runner in scoring position, but Meghan Schouten flew out to right fielder Cara Bohner for the third out.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State\u2019s bats went cold for three innings, they came alive again in the fifth. Needing some offensive momentum, freshman Kirsten Finarelli delivered her first collegiate dinger into right and gave the Nittany Lions another insurance run, 3-0.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Natalie Lieto followed with a walk, which brought in sophomore Bailey Kendziorski, who ended Pappion\u2019s outing. Despite freshman Allison Oneacre walking, Bohner grounded into a fielder\u2019s choice and Oneacre was out at second.</p>\n                <p>Duncan mowed down the Eagles\u2019 batters in the bottom half of the fifth. The left-handed pitcher struck out all three players she faced and preserved the three-run lead going into the later innings.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s bats carried the momentum from the last inning into the sixth. Hannik reached base on a five-pitch walk, and junior Kaylie Walters followed with a single. The blue and white were relentless on the base paths as Hannik stole third and then scored off an error by the Eagles\u2019 shortstop Janis Espinoza.</p>\n                <p>Despite not scoring any more runs in the inning, the Nittany Lions took a 4-0 lead late. After another shutdown inning by Duncan, Penn State pulled away in the seventh.</p>\n                <p>Boston College\u2019s first baseman Emma Knight surrendered the Eagles' third error of the game, allowing a leadoff runner. Lieto then smashed a double into deep center field, but Finarelli didn\u2019t score until Oneacre knocked in both runs on a single, making it 6-0. She also made it to second off another fielding miscue by Boston College.</p>\n                <p>A few batters later, Seidel knocked Oneacre in from third on a groundout to second, and Penn State took a commanding 7-0 lead into the bottom of the seventh. Duncan delivered an impressive collegiate debut, throwing 4 scoreless innings in relief, allowing just 2 hits and striking out 6.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State continues its road trip in Clearwater, Florida, and faces Eastern Kentucky in its first game of Saturday\u2019s doubleheader at noon.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Taylor Mouser has been at Penn State for two months as the new offensive coordinator, and in that timespan, he slammed a Bud Light at both Beaver Stadium and Pegula Ice Arena for men\u2019s hockey games.</p>\n                <p>But he does more than crush cans of beer. He\u2019s been Matt Campbell\u2019s right-hand man at Iowa State, becoming \u201cone of the up-and-coming bright minds in college football\u201d as explained by Campbell.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve watched him mature in terms of who he\u2019s become as a play-caller, a great leader of people,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWhen you put the coordinator title to any of these coaches, I think you\u2019re expecting a gentleman and somebody that\u2019s got unbelievable leadership ability and the ability to align and unify a group, and Taylor\u2019s done a great job of that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mouser spent all 10 seasons with Campbell at Iowa State, and took on titles of graduate assistant, assistant director of scouting, senior quality control on offense and tight ends coach before becoming the offensive coordinator the past two seasons.</p>\n                <p>He additionally spent one year with Campbell when he was the head coach at Toledo as a graduate assistant.</p>\n                <p>So when Campbell left for Penn State and presented Mouser with an opportunity to be the offensive coordinator and tight ends coach for the Nittany Lions, Mouser said it \u201cwasn\u2019t a hard decision at all.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After all, when Mouser finished his time playing defensive line for Division II Adams State in Colorado, he was working at Little Caesars trying to get into the coaching world and Campbell was the only one who picked up his calls.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only person that hit me back,\u201d Mouser said. \u201cI don\u2019t forget that, and the loyalty that he\u2019s given me to be able to promote me to a spot where I got to be the offensive coordinator for the last couple years at Iowa State, and have success. So, it didn\u2019t necessarily matter. It was Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In his short time in State College, Mouser has been impressed by the tradition in the program but also the support from the fanbase. He loved his time going to the men\u2019s hockey games, saying he typically doesn\u2019t get to be a fan, though offensive line coach Ryan Clanton referred to Mouser as the \u201cbiggest hockey fan\u201d in Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s been a culture shift for Mouser, and while there\u2019s adjusting to do off the field, there\u2019s also changes on the field.</p>\n                <p>Mouser made it clear that what worked for the Cyclones might not fly for the Nittany Lions and yet, the belief in those around him show that the 2025 Football Scoop Tight Ends Coach of the Year has what it takes to succeed as a play caller no matter where he is.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's a special dude. He can wear every hat,\u201d quarterbacks coach Jake Waters said. \u201cHe's extremely smart, football wise, extremely competitive. Wants to be the best and then he cares about relationships a lot.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Building relationships is part of the identity that Mouser has created. Clanton said \u201cif you believe in something, he believes in it.\u201d Waters said he\u2019s never met someone who met Mouser and said they didn\u2019t like him.</p>\n                <p>Coming off of a 2025 season where ex-offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki and his play calling left much to be desired, he brings a fresh face to the role with high expectations.</p>\n                <p>Mouser believes in himself, as do many others in his circle, and is ready to put in the work to represent Penn State and what it took for him to get to this point.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis place is incredible, and it\u2019s a school that you dream about when you\u2019re a small school guy. I played at a Division II,\u201d Mouser said. \u201cAs a kid, you watch Penn State football games and the history here. You know about it. Even the idea of coming and coaching at a place like this, it\u2019s so far-fetched. It doesn\u2019t even enter your mind when you know where I was at before.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Vasco Chen | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The South Hills School of Business and Technology hosted its annual Gimme Shelter benefit concert to raise awareness and money for housing security in Centre County Thursday night.</p>\n                <p>The concert lasted from 6-9 p.m. and featured performances from bands like Biscuit Jam featuring Kelly Countermine, Eric Ian Farmer and Jason O, the frontman for My Hero Zero.</p>\n                <p>Selden Smith used to be chair of the Citizens\u2019 Advisory Committee of the Community Development Block Grant program in the State College Borough and advised on the distribution of funds provided by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFrom the federal government\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s hardly any money at all,\u201d Smith, one of the organizers of Gimme Shelter, said. \u201cBut for the agencies, it\u2019s a godsend.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After visiting various agencies that provide support for people facing homelessness and seeing the scale of the problem, Smith teamed up with Jason Olcese, who\u2019s the frontman for the band My Hero Zero and was also on the Citizens\u2019 Advisory Committee.</p>\n                <p>Together, Smith and Olcese came up with the idea of a benefit concert and formed a planning committee of musicians and agency representatives. Eric Ian Farmer, a singer and songwriter who Smith met when they were both on the board of Foxdale Village, proposed the pay-what-you-will model.</p>\n                <p>After they began planning the Gimme Shelter benefit concert in 2023, they held their first event in February 2024 and their second concert the year after, raising approximately $8000 each time.</p>\n                <p>Proceeds were divided equally among the five agencies: Out of the Cold Centre County, State College Community Land Trust, Housing Transitions, Centre Safe and the Centre County Youth Service Bureau.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe face of homelessness is not what they think it is,\u201d Morgan Wasikonis said. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s just people that are unsheltered, on the streets and they don\u2019t interact with them, but there\u2019s a lot of hidden homelessness that people don\u2019t realize is happening.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Wasikonis, the executive director of Housing Transitions, said most people who go to shelters already have a job, but it\u2019s not enough to pay for all their expenses.</p>\n                <p>\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re not always aware when you\u2019re not in that situation,\u201d Mary Rocco, a retired nurse, said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just nice knowing there are organizations out there that help those people.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mayor Ezra Nanes attended the concert to show the borough, who is one of the main sponsors of the event, is committed and invested in helping people when in the community.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOne of the most powerful values and qualities I see in the people here is that they really care and they want to take action on that caring for other people,\u201d Nanes said.</p>\n                <p>Smith said the influence anyone can have as a community member is to reach out to the others in the community. He encourages students who want to get involved to consider volunteering for one of the agencies.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen they graduate and move somewhere else, that knowledge and experience is gonna help the communities they move to,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEven if they know they\u2019re not here forever, the experience they gain here will be theirs forever.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BOROUGH COVERAGE</p>",

Dominating the College World Series, the last time a Big Ten school won was back in 1966, when the Ohio State Buckeyes won it all.</p>\n                <p>In 2019, Michigan reached the final but didn\u2019t win the hardware.</p>\n                <p>Teams in the south thrive on extra base hits and home runs, so one poor pitch from the Nittany Lion bullpen can change the game within seconds.</p>\n                <p>No matter the opposition, the blue and white go up against their postseason fate on the execution of pitching, a very clean defense, and scoring early runs.</p>\n                <p>While there are many months before the Nittany Lions face the playoffs, how the regular season unfolds is a focal point.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State traveled to Clearwater, Florida, for its season opener against Missouri on Friday morning. The matchup was the first game of the Nittany Lions\u2019 doubleheader as the blue and white looked to start its campaign off strong with a solid win over a nonconference opponent.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions pulled off an impressive season opener win in extra innings, with clutch pitching and timely offense, 7-4.</p>\n                <p>While coach Clarisa Crowell started junior McKenna Young on the bump, Missouri gave the ball to senior Cierra Harrison. Both right-handed pitchers started the game off strong with two strikeouts each in the first.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions put pressure on Harrison in the second with a couple of base hits by Natalie Lieto and Cara Bohner, but they were both stranded after Madison Seidel struck out for the third out. After being held scoreless in the top half, the Tigers cracked through in their half of the second.</p>\n                <p>Young walked Madison Uptegrove on four pitches with one out, and then Abby Hay reached on an error by Bohner in right field. Kayley Lenger loaded the bases with a shallow single to center, which led to a sacrifice fly that plated the opening run, 1-0. In her first jam of the season, Young minimized the damage and forced a groundout from the next batter.</p>\n                <p>Missouri took the early lead, but it didn\u2019t last long as Penn State would quickly respond with some runs of its own in the next inning. The top of the lineup delivered the offensive punch, beginning with a Kaylie Walters walk. With just one out, Michela Barbanente knocked in Walters on a hard-hit ball to the right-center gap.</p>\n                <p>Barbanente sped around the bases and reached third for an RBI triple and set up star Brooke Klosowicz for an opportunity to give Penn State its first lead of the season. The Johnsburg, Illinois, native delivered with a single into right field and put the Nittany Lions up 2-1.</p>\n                <p>However, the Tigers quickly evened the score back up in the bottom half. Young struggled with control and walked three Missouri batters, which led to a bases-loaded jam with two outs. The Brodhead, South Dakota, native couldn\u2019t find the strike zone and walked in a run. With the game tied at two, Crowell brought in Abigail Britton, and she stopped the bleeding with a groundout.</p>\n                <p>While the fourth began promising after Bohner ripped a triple to left field, Harrison stayed composed and struck out the next three Penn State batters looking to prevent Bohner from scoring.</p>\n                <p>After Britton delivered a shutdown inning, the blue and white broke through on offense in the fifth. Harrison was on a roll and retired five straight Nittany Lions until freshman Kirsten Finarelli lined a two-out single up the middle. In one of the biggest at-bats of the day, Lieto doubled to right field and plated Finarelli, giving Penn State a 3-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Britton retired the first five Missouri batters she faced until she lost control and hit Emma Jackson with one out. The sophomore then walked pinch-hitter Saniya Hill, prompting Crowell to bring in freshman Brevyn Kellepouris.</p>\n                <p>The left-handed pitcher surrendered an RBI single by Uptegrove, which tied the game again, 3-3. However, with runners on first and third, the Olathe, Kansas, native kept her composure and struck out the next two Missouri batters swinging, keeping the game knotted.</p>\n                <p>Penn State went down quietly in its half of the sixth, but Kellepouris found herself in a jam later in the inning. Sophie Smith smashed a leadoff double down the right field line and a sacrifice bunt quickly advanced her to third. Yet, Kellepouris escaped the scoring threat by retiring the next two batters on a lineout and groundout.</p>\n                <p>Pressure mounted as the game headed to the seventh, still tied, and neither squad produced much offense in the inning, so the tight contest headed to extra innings.</p>\n                <p>Finarelli began the eighth on second as the blue and white\u2019s ghost runner and she quickly moved to third off a sacrifice bunt by Lieto. Freshman Allison Oneacre plated Finarelli with a short sacrifice fly and the Nittany Lions took a 4-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>Kellepouris stayed in the game and faced the bottom half of the Tigers' lineup. While she got the first out off catcher\u2019s interference, Kayley Lenger knocked a single up the middle and plated the tying run, 4-4. Lenger also advanced to second base off the throw to home, so Missouri quickly had Penn State on its heels.</p>\n                <p>The freshman struck out Smith for the second out, but walked the next two batters for a two-out bases-loaded situation with the season opener on the line. Crowell called upon junior Bridget Nemeth to extend the game. The Glendora, California, native forced a groundout to second baseman Barbanente, who flipped it to shortstop Walters for the crucial third out.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white came away empty in its half of the ninth, so Nemeth needed a scoreless inning of her own. After a successful sacrifice bunt to first base, the Tigers had a runner on third and a chance to end the game. Yet, Nemeth rose to the occasion and retired the next two Tigers, forcing a tenth inning.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s offense finally broke Missouri reliever Courney Donahue after just one run in four innings. With one out and Barbanente on third, Finarelli slipped a single to shallow right field and plated the go-ahead run, 5-4. The Lehman, Pennsylvania, native also advanced to second on the hit due to a fielding miscue by right fielder Claire Cahalan.</p>\n                <p>The scoring didn\u2019t stop there as Oneacre smashed her first collegiate home run to deep left field and added massive insurance runs, extending the lead 7-4. Now in a prime position to win the season opener, Nemeth retired the Tigers in order and secured the nonconference victory for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State plays the second game of its doubleheader against Boston College at 1 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Looking at Penn State basketball\u2019s Justin Houser\u2019s development as he sees more minutes due to injuries",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State originally planned for freshman Justin Houser to potentially redshirt this season while giving center Yanic Konan Niederhauser a 7-footer he could play against in practice.</p>\n                <p>Instead, with Konan Niederhauser leaving for the NBA this past offseason, Houser is on a different development path as he\u2019s a depth piece. Big men Ivan Juri\u0107, Tibor Mirti\u010d and Sa\u0161a Ciani have all missed the last two games due to injuries, so Houser\u2019s seen an uptick in playing time, including a career high in minutes during Penn State\u2019s 110-69 loss to Michigan on Thursday night.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's the biggest guy on the team when Ivan is not there, so he's got to play, and it's great for him as a freshman to play 21 minutes in a Big Ten game against the No. 2 team in the country,\u201d Mike Rhoades said postgame. \u201cIt makes you realize where you're at, how much work you have ahead of you, and you got to build on it. He battled. He was nervous early, and then I thought he battled as he went on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Houser hasn\u2019t started either game as the Nittany Lions opted for a small-ball lineup with forward Josh Reed at the five to begin both matchups, but he\u2019s come in off the bench early. The 7-footer subbed in at the 16:47 mark of the first half in Thursday\u2019s game.</p>\n                <p>The Phelps School product was up against a tough Michigan frontcourt with players like 7-foot-3 center Aday Mara. Houser ended his night with six points, two rebounds and two blocks on 2-of-5 shooting, and he picked up four fouls as well.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades has said previously that the speed of a game catches up to Houser at times, and he reiterated during Tuesday\u2019s press conference that Houser has to get bigger. Houser\u2019s listed weight is 235 pounds, and Rhoades said the goal is 250 pounds.</p>\n                <p>While Rhoades outlined the work Houser still needs to do, he gave some praise to the young 7-footer, too. During his limited playing time this season, him giving full effort is apparent.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEspecially since Christmas time, I think he's just really improved, and some things are becoming clearer for him,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cHe loves basketball. He loves being here at Penn State. When you're a big guy like him, freshman bigs don't understand how physical the Big Ten is until they get hit a couple times.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Houser has seen at least five minutes of playing time in three games this season. Last Sunday, he chipped in three rebounds, two points and a block while only recording one foul in eight minutes during Penn State\u2019s 77-75 win over Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Earlier this season, Houser played 13 minutes against Pitt on Dec. 21, and while it was an 80-46 loss for the Nittany Lions, he helped provide a spark to begin a comeback attempt before it fell apart. Houser totaled five points and a block with four fouls versus the Panthers.</p>\n                <p>Throughout his first year in Happy Valley, Houser gets to work with assistant coach Brent Scott, who developed Konan Niederhauser into a first-round NBA draft pick. Houser said his defense has taken the \u201cbiggest jump,\u201d saying he thinks he\u2019s improved tenfold.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's been great working with coach Scott,\u201d Houser said Tuesday. \u201cI mean, he's helped me a lot after practice. I\u2019m watching film with him. He's working me out. He's helping me improve my skills a lot, which has been awesome.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Houser is a raw talent who isn\u2019t expected to see much playing time when the depth chart is fully healthy. Juri\u0107, who was listed as \u201cquestionable,\u201d still has uncertain availability with Rhoades saying he hopes to have Juri\u0107 back for the upcoming USC game on Sunday, while Ciani and Mirti\u010d have yet to shake off the \u201cout\u201d tag on the availability report.</p>\n                <p>In other words, Houser could still be tasked with a sizable role in the rotation against the Trojans. It\u2019s a different reality from developing under Konan Niederhauser, but Rhoades has one main message to Houser.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI just tell him to go out there and play harder than the guy you're going against,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cLet's just start with that. I say that to him all the time. Outrun him, outplay him, be more physical than him, and if you get lost in that, then you're not overthinking the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s lacrosse is finally here.</p>\n                <p>Months after Kayla Treanor\u2019s hiring, her squad will get their first look of the season at Richmond at 12 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is coming off its first losing record since 2022 and will look to get off on a strong note against the Spiders.</p>\n                <p>On the other hand, Richmond experienced success throughout the regular season last year, reaching double-digit wins with a 10-7 regular season record. However, its success ran out in the postseason.</p>\n                <p>After defeating fifth-seeded St. Bonaventure 11-8 in the first round of the Atlantic 10 tournament, the Spiders scored the same amount of goals against No. 1 UMass, but ultimately fell 16-11.</p>\n                <p>Richmond had a pair of high-scoring attackers who led the team last year in Colleen Quinn and Alexis Morton.</p>\n                <p>While Quinn graduated, Morton is back for her senior year after a successful Year 3. The Manhasset, New York, native recorded 39 goals and 37 assists for 76 points \u2014 the second-most on the team.</p>\n                <p>On the goalkeeping end, junior Abby Francioli is back for another year after starting all 19 games last year.</p>\n                <p>Through 963 minutes, Francioli recorded 155 saves with a 46.5% save percentage.</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s matchup will likely be a battle in the net, as the Nittany Lions have a dominant goalkeeper of their own.</p>\n                <p>After cruising through her freshman year and being named Big Ten Freshman of the Year, Sydney Manning has been the go-to goalie for the blue and white. Last year, Manning recorded 110 saves in her 12 starts.</p>\n                <p>Despite Richmond being without last year\u2019s top scorer, it will still have plenty of other high-power attackers to challenge Manning.</p>\n                <p>The Spiders return their third, fourth, fifth and sixth leading scorers from last year, as Mortion and Juliana Stanley combine for 74 goals.</p>\n                <p>In just seven combined starts, Charlotte Edwards and Birdget Lonsinger also scored 31 total goals and will likely improve that number with more time on the field this year.</p>\n                <p>Just as Manning is challenged in the net, however, the Nittany Lions have plenty of offensive strength that should challenge Francioli.</p>\n                <p>Senior Erika Ho returns for her final season after leading the team with 46 goals last year. Twenty-goal-scorer Emma Kelly and 49-point scorer Kelly MacKinney will also take the field and earn many starts this year, providing further challenges to Richmond.</p>\n                <p>While both sides have their fair share of strengths heading into Saturday\u2019s game, the Nittany Lions will look to keep their undefeated all-time 11-0 record against Richmond alive.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s historic 2024 season earned the program its first NCAA Regional berth since 2011. The Nittany Lions were unable to build on that momentum in 2025, finishing 25-27 and falling in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white return significant experience and star power on both sides of the ball, and if all the pieces come together, coach Clarisa Crowell\u2019s squad could see its second Regional appearance in three years.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has made 11 NCAA Tournament appearances, but has never advanced past the Regional round. A push for the program\u2019s first Super Regional, and potentially a trip to the Women\u2019s College World Series in Oklahoma City, is possible in 2026, but the path won\u2019t be easy.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look at some of the top national competition Penn State will have to face in pursuit of a deep postseason run.</p>\n                <p>The SEC</p>\n                <p>The SEC is expected to be the most dominant conference in college softball this season. In 2025, the SEC set an NCAA record with 14 teams reaching the tournament, the most by any conference in history.</p>\n                <p>Twelve of the 25 teams in ESPN/USA Softball\u2019s preseason poll reside in the SEC, including half of the top-10. If the Nittany Lions reach the postseason, they\u2019ll likely have to get through at least one SEC team.</p>\n                <p>The team to beat is reigning national champion Texas. The Longhorns enter 2026 tied for the preseason No.1 spot with last year's runner-up Texas Tech. In each of the last four seasons, the preseason No. 1 team has won the national title.</p>\n                <p>Last season, Texas led Division I with 630 hits, finished second with 460 RBIs and third with a .352 batting average. The Longhorns return standout hitters senior Reese Atwood and junior Katie Stewart.</p>\n                <p>Atwood hit .393, with 21 home runs and a nation-leading 89 RBIs, earning her second-straight unanimous NFCA First Team All-American honor. Stewart hit .381 with 17 home runs and 80 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>Texas also returns its ace Teagan Kavan, who went 28-5 with a 2.16 ERA and 230 strikeouts in 207 innings pitched.</p>\n                <p>Other SEC contenders include Oklahoma, Tennessee, Florida and Arkansas.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will face Tennessee in Knoxville on Feb. 27 and 28. The Lady Volunteers owned the nation's lowest ERA last season at 1.82.</p>\n                <p>Since 2000, the Nittany Lions have made nine Regional appearances, and four have been hosted by SEC teams. Two of those, including the most recent one, were at Texas A&amp;M.</p>\n                <p>If history is any indicator, then Penn State might once again draw an SEC team if the Nittany Lions hear their name called on Selection Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Texas Tech</p>\n                <p>Texas Tech is coming off a historic season, finishing one win shy of a national title in its first-ever WCWS appearance.</p>\n                <p>The Red Raiders made headlines in the 2024 offseason by landing former Stanford ace NiJaree Canady, who led the Cardinal to two WCWS appearances and was named the 2024 USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year.</p>\n                <p>In her first season at Texas Tech, Canady posted a 34-7 record, 1.11 ERA and 319 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>This offseason, the Red Raiders added three NFCA All-Americans via the transfer portal, highlighted by Ohio State\u2019s Jasmyn Burns, former Florida Gator Mia Williams and ex-Tennessee slugger Taylor Pannell.</p>\n                <p>The Red Raiders bolstered their pitching depth with former UCLA arm Kaitlyn Terry, who owns a 2.50 career ERA.</p>\n                <p>The Red Raiders are expected to control the Big 12, with Arizona and Oklahoma State being the only other top-25 teams in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Florida State and Clemson</p>\n                <p>The last leg for Penn State would be the ACC, likely led by Florida State or Clemson.</p>\n                <p>The Seminoles enter the season ranked No. 7 and return strong duos on both sides of the ball. Pitchers Jazzy Francik and Ashtyn Danley were the ACC\u2019s top two arms, combining for a 1.55 ERA and just five total losses.</p>\n                <p>Offensively, Isa Torres and Kennedy Harp anchor the lineup. Torres led Florida State with a .436 batting average and struck out just five times. Harp hit .412 with 49 RBIs and tied for the nation 's-best mark of 10 triples. As a team, the Seminoles posted the ACC\u2019s second-highest batting average at .346.</p>\n                <p>Clemson, a program that debuted in 2020, is the only team on this list without a WCWS appearance.

    "description": "<p>While a majority of Penn State\u2019s team can expect to see new faces sprinkled throughout in Kayla Treanor\u2019s first year, the defense and goalkeeper situations should remain fairly steady from last year.</p>\n                <p>With a majority of last year\u2019s line returning for another year, here\u2019s a look at the Nittany Lions\u2019 defenders and goalkeepers entering this season.</p>\n                <p>Returning defenders</p>\n                <p>Among the returners, redshirt sophomore Cailin Hetrick stands as one of two defenders who started all 16 games last year.</p>\n                <p>Despite her youth, Hetrick recorded 17 ground balls and caused eight turnovers while only giving up seven balls.</p>\n                <p>Alongside Hetrick is senior Maggie Driver, who took a big leap in Year 3 with 16 starts. Driver played arguably more aggressive defense, picking up 18 caused turnovers and 30 ground balls.</p>\n                <p>Lauren Tinson and Lily Spilker each found their spots in the starting lineups eight times apiece last season, making their marks on the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Tinson\u2019s stats weren\u2019t super flashy, but she recorded nine ground balls and five caused turnovers nonetheless. Spilker saw the same success with ground balls, but also forced 16 turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Ava Stummer, Lily Strohecker and Brooke Lattanzi all had little to no playing time last year and will look to see the field more this season.</p>\n                <p>Freshmen defenders</p>\n                <p>Compared to the rest of the position groups, Penn State\u2019s defense has the smallest freshman class with just two athletes.</p>\n                <p>Sarah Ann\u00e9 comes to Happy Valley as a two-time Utah Women\u2019s 5A State champion, earning the honor in 2022 and 2024. In that year, she was named the Utah State Playoff MVP and earned All-American honors from USA Lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>Susannah O\u2019Connell joins the Nittany Lions from a little closer to home, hailing from Summit, New Jersey. There, O\u2019Connell served as a tenacious defender, breaking her high school\u2019s record for most caused turnovers while earning USA Lacrosse All-American honors and being named a two-time All-State honoree.</p>\n                <p>Goalkeepers</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 premiere goalie over the past two years has been Sydney Manning, who\u2019s started in all but six games.</p>\n                <p>Now in her junior year, Manning will look to continue that stretch and improve on her performance. In her freshman year, she recorded a 41.3% save percentage and improved to 43.7% last year.</p>\n                <p>Out of the other three goalies on Penn State\u2019s roster, only Emily Bette has seen playing time, recording seven minutes in 2023. She will likely be the backup keeper for her senior year.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Arden Jansen and freshman Makenna Gagliardi have yet to see action for the blue and white and likely won\u2019t this year. Jansen won the district and league championship for Radnor High School in 2024, while Gagliardi was the 2023 and 2024 Suffolk County champion.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

Ultimately, Nebraska finished in third, and also took a loss against Ohio State last Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a break after this meet, resuming the season on Feb. 20 for the Winter Cup, so seeing it have a chance to push for a win and end on a good note is expected.The Cornhuskers need a solid win to head in the right direction, so putting up a solid lineup and finding ways to push the Nittany Lions is another thing to expect.</p>\n                <p>Looking at areas of focus for the Nittany Lions, pommel horse and vault will be important since those are where most of the top numbers are coming from. Ricky Perez and Landon Simpson are looking strong to lead on pommel horse, with both gymnasts consistently putting up 13.500 and above all season. Simpson also comes in strong on vault, with Shaun Smith also having high numbers on the event.</p>\n                <p>The Cornhuskers have a few options to go head-to-head on vault against the Nittany Lions, with Luke James having 14.500 against Ohio State and Alex Nitache, who put up a 14.300. Nebraska likely chooses Nathan York for pommel horse, who secured a 14.000 against Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska will need to consider using athletes like James and York across multiple events and spread out its roster to target the areas the Nittany Lions excel.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has figured out its groove this season, having worked out the holes in its lineups and moved gymnasts around to be effective in more than one event. Nebraska has been using the same athletes in the same event and has not quite found a way to have high scores across multiple apparatuses.</p>\n                <p>Looking at starting a winning streak will be important for the Cornhuskers to have a successful rest of the season. With the strong roster of the blue and white, this meet could be a tool to test out what a possible lineup for Nebraska could look like against a more settled team.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Press Cider &amp; Craft Beverage Taphouse opened last October at 113 Heister St. I\u2019ve passed by it multiple times on my way to class, but I\u2019ve never had the chance to go. I recently got the opportunity to try out their menu on a hopping Friday night where not only the drinks warm you up, but the atmosphere as well.</p>\n                <p>The Press invites you to take a seat wherever you like via a chalkboard near the entrance, and tells you to order at the bar when you\u2019re ready. The Press was lively when I arrived, with music playing from the speakers at a volume that was comfortable enough to hear your friends speaking. The taphouse has very warm lighting that gives the space a welcoming vibe.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s a drinks-only establishment with a bring-your-own-food invitation. I brought a wrap with me from On a Roll at Redifer Commons in Penn State\u2019s South Food District. My wrap had roast chicken, mayonnaise, sliced tomatoes, red wine vinegar, olive oil and Italian seasoning. I also got Miss Vickie\u2019s Salt and Vinegar chips as a side.</p>\n                <p>The Press\u2019s menu is organized into four sections: cider, wine and mead, craft PA beer, craft cocktails and non-alcoholic options. I ordered a flight of four 4 ounce samples and asked the bartender for recommendations on both their sweetest drinks and other popular favorites. He recommended I try number nine and number four as sweet options, and number two and number nine for favorites.</p>\n                <p>Number Nine: Chucklin Berry</p>\n                <p>Chucklin Berry was the sweetest drink and my favorite of the night. This is no surprise for a person with a love of sweet drinks (think strawberry daiquiris). It smelled sweet, but in a pleasant, fruity way. The drink was a cider with blueberry, strawberry and raspberry flavors, and the fruitiness of the drink made it very sweet.</p>\n                <p>The aftertaste was a very sweet strawberry flavor, and that paired with the blueberry was more pronounced in the drink over the hint of raspberry. This made for the cider to be smooth with a bit of a tang.</p>\n                <p>However, the hint of raspberry tied the drink together for a great three-berry flavor combination. I finished the whole thing and would recommend it for any fellow sweet drink lovers out there.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 10/10</p>\n                <p>Number Four: Cranpus</p>\n                <p>Number four was my second favorite. Cranpus was a half-cider, half-wine combination drink.</p>\n                <p>It smelled the sweetest, which made sense since it was half-wine. It was not as smooth as the number nine and in fact was a little sharp. This sharpness could have been from the drink\u2019s higher ABV.</p>\n                <p>I could taste the wine right away. The cranberry and pomegranate were the flavors that stood out the most, and they overpowered the subtle hints of raspberry.</p>\n                <p>Even with the overwhelming taste of cranberry and pomegranate, it was still one of my favorites and had a very sweet and fruity aftertaste.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Numbers nine and four tasted the best with my wrap and chips, with the sweetness of the drinks acting as a nice juxtaposition to the salty chips. This made for a great flavor combination.</p>\n                <p>Number 2: Ginger? I Pear-ly Know Her</p>\n                <p>This drink was dry, which is expected in an off-dry cider. What was not expected was the bitterness in both taste and smell.</p>\n                <p>The ginger also overpowered the pear where I could still taste it and it struck a nice balance, but I wished the pear would have been a little stronger overall. This drink wasn\u2019t my favorite, but for any ginger-lovers out there, this is the drink for you.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 6/10</p>\n                <p>Number 10: Monkey Step Wine Spritzer</p>\n                <p>I thought I was going to like this one because it was wine \u2014 I was wrong.</p>\n                <p>This drink smelled and tasted the most bitter, but still maintained a smooth finish.</p>\n                <p>The lavender was so overpowering I could not taste the blueberry flavor at all. The too-much lavender taste made this my least favorite drink of the four. However, for those of you who love the seasonal Starbucks Lavender menu, this would be heaven in a glass.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 4/10</p>\n                <p>Veronica\u2019s Food Sensitivity Corner</p>\n                <p>As a student who was recently diagnosed with a dairy sensitivity, I am always on the lookout for foods that fit my new dietary needs, and I am also aware there are other students who may have similar needs as well.</p>\n                <p>The ciders, wines and meads offered at The Press are all gluten-free.</p>\n                <p>I will definitely be returning to The Press in the future to get another glass of the Chucklin Berry and bring my friends along with me. For delicious drinks with a side of warm atmosphere, look no further than The Press.</p>\n                <p>A downside is The Press is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, but it\u2019s open on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 6 p.m. to midnight, and on Saturdays from 2 p.m. to midnight and Sundays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>It\u2019s 11:15 a.m. on the first day of classes and my mind is screaming, \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d</p>\n                <p>English 515: Creative Nonfiction Workshop/Appropriation is the second graduate-level class I\u2019ve taken in my integrated bachelor\u2019s/master\u2019s program.</p>\n                <p>Going into it, I was incredibly excited. I love writing (if you couldn\u2019t tell by the fact that I write these columns for fun) and creative nonfiction is the niche within English that I plan on getting my master\u2019s degree in.</p>\n                <p>As class began, we went around the room introducing ourselves. Each of my classmates sounded so sophisticated, intelligent and confident. Just hearing them speak for a few minutes, I could tell that they were talented writers.</p>\n                <p>Despite the kindness of my professor and fellow classmates, I quickly felt out of place. They had their acts together and I most certainly didn\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>After that first class, I found myself struggling to write. I told myself that whatever I wrote needed to be perfect. I had to prove to everyone, and myself, that I belonged.</p>\n                <p>Words failed me as I stared at a blank Google Doc.</p>\n                <p>On the phone with my mom, I told her bluntly: I feel completely out of my depth.</p>\n                <p>I can imagine that for graduating students in the midst of starting new jobs, internships, or graduate programs, I\u2019m not alone in this feeling.</p>\n                <p>Something I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of is \u201cimposter syndrome.\u201d Psychology Today describes it as feeling \u201cundeserving\u201d of accomplishments and as doubting competency and intelligence.</p>\n                <p>If you were a so-called \u201cgifted kid\u201d or are, as Psychology Today puts it, a \u201chigh achiever,\u201d you\u2019re more likely to deal with this internalized feeling of not being enough. In fact, the outlet also says \u201caround 70 percent of adults may experience impostorism at least once in their lifetime.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Psychology Today indicates that to overcome imposter syndrome, you should stop comparing yourself to others and remember all that you\u2019ve accomplished.</p>\n                <p>You passed the interview process. Your application was accepted. You earned the right to be here.</p>\n                <p>On a different note, we often go into things expecting them to be easy. However, as is frequently the case in the great unfolding of life, things aren\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>As an anxious individual, challenge can sometimes manifest as discomfort. I so desperately want to feel like I\u2019m part of the group, especially in the field I hope to enter. When things feel off, it feels safer to retreat than to engage.</p>\n                <p>Let me remind you that just because things are difficult doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t worth doing.</p>\n                <p>Whether it\u2019s a new job, graduate school, or whatever your next step is, it\u2019s likely not going to be what you\u2019re used to. Give yourself time to adjust.</p>\n                <p>Everyone was once the newbie at something. It\u2019s OK to feel a little overwhelmed. The important thing is seeing it through.</p>\n                <p>Finally, let me share with you one of my favorite poems, \u201cWild Geese\u201d by Mary Oliver.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019ve turned to it in many a stressful and uncertain moment and it helps bring me a sense of calm.</p>\n                <p>I encourage you to read the whole thing, but the first line sums up what I hope you get out of this column: \u201cYou do not have to be good.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That sounds bad taken out of context, but what Oliver is getting at is you don\u2019t need to be perfect. You need to be you, and that\u2019s enough.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m looking forward to my next 515 class. I\u2019m not going to let self-doubt ruin what I\u2019m sure will be a rewarding opportunity for growth.</p>\n                <p>As Mary Oliver says, \u201cthe world offers itself to your imagination.\u201d Go forth and do great things.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "title": "Position Preview | Penn State baseball welcomes veteran-led outfield",
    "author": "Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State baseball is on the rise. After recent success under coach Mike Gambino, the blue and white will seek to remain competitive in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Last season, the Nittany Lions marked one of their more successful years in recent history, finishing 33-23. In 2024, Penn State reached the Big Ten Tournament Championship, narrowly losing to Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>If anything, all indications are pointing to a successful season ahead. And, as the backbone of the roster, Penn State\u2019s outfield will have a shot to replicate its dominance from last year.</p>\n                <p>Luckily, Gambino and the Nittany Lions are welcoming continuity with four of their six outfielders returning. Penn State will embrace its large veteran presence.</p>\n                <p>Here is what you need to know.</p>\n                <p>Returners</p>\n                <p>Last season, Penn State was on the opposite end of the spectrum. The team welcomed a clean slate of outfielders, and it paid dividends.</p>\n                <p>College baseball has revealed several key factors to success, one of which is consistency. The Nittany Lions built their roster around the outfield, which generated an explosive offense last season. Among those talents was Paxton Kling, who led the team in batting average and left for the MLB Draft.</p>\n                <p>However, not far behind him was Jack Porter. Now, in his redshirt junior year, Porter will seek to replicate his past success.</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-1 Clearwater, Florida, native provides a versatile ability to aid with his hot bat. While batting .310, he also tallied 57 hits with a .549 slugging percentage. Porter will undoubtedly be the focal point of the offense as he started and played in 47 games last season.</p>\n                <p>Right behind him was Jesse Jaconski, who, like Porter, presents a utility threat, being able to play multiple positions. The former North Carolina and Hartford Community College transfer played a major role in last year\u2019s excellence from inside the batter\u2019s box.</p>\n                <p>Jaconski, a right-handed senior, started and played in 55 games, and marked the third-highest batting average at .298. But it's all about the power. His extreme efficiency accounted for 61 hits, 54 RBIs and 12 home runs.</p>\n                <p>Aside from two of last year\u2019s stars, Penn State will also welcome back Cohl Mercado, who played more of a backseat role. The 5-foot-8 redshirt junior, formerly transferred from Boston College, found a unique role in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Mercado started 38 games last season and played in 46 games, tallying a .230 batting average. He contributed 32 runs and 31 hits and endured spurts of struggle. While he wasn\u2019t a regular starter, there is momentum for him to fill out the final projected starting role on Opening Day.</p>\n                <p>Jack Messina is the final returner for Penn State, who is listed as a first baseman and outfielder. The State High product played in one game last season and tallied one at bat. He will likely be a bench reserve once more for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Transfers</p>\n                <p>Last year, the Nittany Lions proved the transfer portal is vital to success. Now, in a less urgent situation, Penn State\u2019s transfer prospects will look to add depth and balance to the lineup.</p>\n                <p>Penn State acquired two transfer prospects in this year\u2019s cycle, both of which came from non-power conference schools.</p>\n                <p>Maddox McDonald, a Trinity transfer, had success in Division III, leading the Bantams to a SCAC regular-season title, SCAC tournament title and the Division III regional final.</p>\n                <p>The stat sheet appears even better. McDonald appeared in 81 games, making 76 starts over his two seasons with the program. He batted .329 with a .532 slugging percentage across his collegiate career. As a steady bat, he also presents loads of speed, having successfully stolen 19-of-22 bases last season.</p>\n                <p>McDonald certainly will be in the mix for a starting role with the Nittany Lions, most likely in center field.</p>\n                <p>Justin Turcovski rounds out the small incoming class as a former Pitt-Johnstown transfer. The 5-foot-10, redshirt senior, will aid Mercado and Messina as the left-handed bats in the outfield.</p>\n                <p>This gives Turcovski a good chance to be featured in the lineup. Nevertheless, he had much success in his long tenure with the program. The Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, native played in 156 games, making 149 starts in his four seasons.</p>\n                <p>Turcovski has been a very consistent player over his career, batting .282, slugging .505 and securing a .373 on-base percentage. While he likely won\u2019t be in the starting mix, he might be featured as a player off the bench and used sporadically</p>\n                <p>Projected Starters</p>\n                <p>While Porter is the most experienced player amongst the group, he was used as a designated hitter last season. Still, he will likely aid Jaconski as the other veteran outfielder. These two will likely start in right and left field.</p>\n                <p>Behind these two, McDonald is most likely to start in center field, given his speed and reliable bat, providing highlight-level plays to patrol the grass.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Over the past several weeks, Penn State has broken nearly a dozen school and NCAA records in various events.</p>\n                <p>Between Allon Clay\u2019s 1000-meter school record at the Nittany Lion Challenge and Handal Roban\u2019s 800-meter school record at the Penn State National Open, the Nittany Lions have looked unstoppable.</p>\n                <p>For the men\u2019s squad in particular, that success will pay off with the postseason drawing near.</p>\n                <p>In last week\u2019s USTFCCCA poll, the Nittany Lions were ranked No. 4 \u2014 the highest in program history. Coupled with four athletes with top-five marks in the country this season, the men\u2019s team is capable of winning its first Big Ten indoor title in program history.</p>\n                <p>Since the western expansion to the Big Ten, Oregon and USC have been the frontrunners in the conference, with Ohio State, Purdue and a few other schools popping up here and there.</p>\n                <p>While the Ducks and Trojans remain powerhouses this year, Penn State\u2019s success has been unmatched and may be enough to dethrone Oregon.</p>\n                <p>Across the board, the Nittany Lions have seen success in nearly every event, including Ajani Dwyer in the short sprints, Jake Palermo in the long sprints, Roban, Clay and Yukichi Ishii in middle-distance, Nick Sloff in long-distance and several dominant throwers.</p>\n                <p>According to the current top marks in the Big Ten this season, Penn State is expected to finish runner-up to Oregon with 87 points, falling short by 27 points.</p>\n                <p>However, with the current rate of growth by this year\u2019s squad, nothing is out of the question for the blue and white as its athletes have shown they\u2019re still far from the top of their games.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s 60-meter and 200-meter, Dwyer holds the No. 1 and No. 2 times in program history, respectively. While those times both lead the conference so far, the second-team All-American has stumbled out of the blocks in almost every race and is far from his potential.</p>\n                <p>After setting a new school record in 45.65 in the 400-meter last year, Jake Palermo is already just 0.33 seconds from that mark despite running just one race this year. In addition, he too leads the conference in his respective race.</p>\n                <p>Ryan Henry and Dylan Lambrecht each have top-five Big Ten marks in the shot put after setting the No. 4 and No. 5 marks in school history in January.</p>\n                <p>The weight throw has experienced similar success as Collin Burkhart threw a personal-best 21.22m throw last weekend to set the No. 5 throw in school history and the conference this season.</p>\n                <p>While those marks alone represent a successful Penn State squad, the mid-distance and distance groups push the team\u2019s Big Ten chances over the edge, with school records in the 800m, mile and 3000-meter this season.</p>\n                <p>Over the past month, Sloff has broken the school record in the mile and 3000m while setting the No. 2 mark in the 5000-meter.</p>\n                <p>However, the 1000m and 800m have seen the most success so far.</p>\n                <p>At the Nittany Lion Challenge, Clay, Roban, Ishii and Sloff set the No. 4, 8, 9 and 10 marks in NCAA history in the 1000m while Clay broke the school record. Two weeks later at the National Open, Roban and Clay ran the No. 2 and 5 marks in NCAA history in the 800m, also setting the top-two marks in school history.</p>\n                <p>With a little less than a month until the Big Ten championships, the Nittany Lions are in a strong position and capable of winning their first indoor conference title this season.</p>\n                <p>MORE TRACK AND FIELD COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn started its February off strong, earning an 85-82 overtime win on the road against Purdue on Wednesday night. This marked the Lady Lions\u2019 first victory since Dec. 20, and their first in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Now with some momentum on its side, the blue and white welcome a tough task in No. 12 Michigan State. Tipoff is set for 1 p.m. on Saturday at Rec Hall</p>\n                <p>The Spartans were also in action on Wednesday night, but didn\u2019t have as much to celebrate as Penn State did. Michigan State fell to No. 22 Maryland 86-70 on its home floor.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions put themselves up against one of the top scoring teams in the Big Ten. The Spartans average 85.5 points per game, which is third in the conference behind only Michigan and UCLA, who are the Big Ten\u2019s top two teams.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white may struggle with the high-octane Michigan State offense, as Penn State has held a conference opponent to under 80 points just twice this season.</p>\n                <p>Defensively, the Spartans hold opponents to 63 points per game, which is 11.5 points less than the Lady Lions' average per contest.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s win over the Boilermakers was paced by a 30-point performance from 5-foot-8 guard Kiyomi McMiller. This marked the sophomore\u2019s 22nd double-digit outing this season, along with the second time she\u2019s reached 30 points. Additionally, McMiller recorded five rebounds and a team-high nine assists.</p>\n                <p>McMiller\u2019s 19.4 points per game lead the Lady Lions and is tied for fourth in the Big Ten. The Silver Springs, Maryland, native also paces the offense with 4.5 assists per game.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State\u2019s leading scorer in its loss to the Terrapins was 6-foot-3 forward Grace VanSlooten, who scored 19 points. The senior also led the Spartans' box score with nine rebounds and four blocks.</p>\n                <p>VanSlooten is Michigan State\u2019s top scorer with 15.3 points per game. She\u2019s also the Spartans' leading shot blocker, with 24 on the season.</p>\n                <p>These two teams are similar in the way that both have multiple offensive weapons and don\u2019t rely on one go-to scorer.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle is right behind McMiller on the stat sheet, averaging 19.3 points per game. The redshirt junior recorded her seventh double-double of the season against Purdue, with 19 points and 20 rebounds.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions also see high production from sharpshooter Moriah Murray, who averages 10 points per game. The 5-foot-8 guard scored 15 points on Wednesday night after going 5-for-6 from beyond the arc. Murray\u2019s 2.8 made three-pointers per game are tied for the most in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State provides a balanced offensive attack, with five players averaging double-digit points. After VanSlooten, the Spartans second highest scorer is 5-foot-9 guard Kennedy Blair.</p>\n                <p>Blair netted 15 points against Maryland and averages 13.8 points per game on the season. The redshirt sophomore\u2019s 5.5 assists per game lead the team and is the fourth-best mark in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>As Penn State tries to build off its first conference victory, Michigan State enters Saturday's matchup looking to get back in the win column after dropping its last two games.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>ANN ARBOR, MICH. \u2014 At the University of Michigan, in the shadows of the Big House, lies Crisler Arena. Inside the complex lies a modern-day coliseum, which houses some of the best basketball the Big Ten has to offer. Coach Dusty May has led the No. 2 Wolverines to their best start in program history after a 110-69 drubbing of the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>21-1 Michigan fosters a program levels above the operation currently running in Happy Valley, built upon core principles that define the team over individuals in the NIL era.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a team of elite talents all coming together with a common goal,\u201d guard Nimari Burnett said.</p>\n                <p>May\u2019s success is derived from the established Michigan program attracting talent from around the country, then guiding it to camaraderie that keeps players in Michigan long term. Even after an 8-24 season, the team rebuilt to a top program in the country with a core of talented veterans staying the course.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(May) recruited a bunch of unselfish guys willing to do whatever it takes to win,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cWe love to see each other succeed while being elite talents.\u201d</p>\n                <p>But on top of the dominant play on the court, Michigan has the basketball experience perfected. Penn State basketball and the Bryce Jordan Center could take some notes.</p>\n                <p>An elite program and sustained success leads to gameday tradition that fosters an unforgettable experience. Much like Penn State football\u2019s success bred a fanbase known for its signature voice during plays, Michigan basketball has developed a devoted following united with sound.</p>\n                <p>A flock of students clad in pink, blue and maize entered the arena through the gates of Michigan Stadium. They filled up a student section the size of Penn State\u2019s early, then filled into sections 132 and 128 above the Wolverines\u2019 exit gate. 12,000 fans surrounded the students to create a full arena that hasn\u2019t been seen in Happy Valley in years.</p>\n                <p>Lights strung onto the guardrails of the staircases flashed, adding to the mystique, while fans sounded a boisterous yell for big moments, even in a small game for the home team. The fans united for a signature dance, similar to that of the Roar Zone, to honor veterans and to sing happy birthday to one of their players.</p>\n                <p>While the game itself was a breeze for a talented roster, with one media member quipping \u201cit was nice to have everything written by halftime\u201d after the game, the crowd continued to stay invested, blowing the Nittany Lions\u2019 home environment out of the water.</p>\n                <p>Even in the blowout, the people in the arena were brought together behind a story shared for \"Block Cancer\u201d night. A Michigan alumnus named Alyssa was brought in front of the crowd. She was diagnosed with cancer four months after the birth of her son and leaned on the University of Michigan Health to battle her diagnosis. 22 years later, her son has graduated from Michigan, and she stood healthy in front of her alma mater to a smattering of cheers as she delivered a message to an attentive community.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFind a way to enjoy life and always find a silver lining,\u201d Alyssa said as the crowd united behind her.</p>\n                <p>Crisler Arena was built in 1967, but it feels like luxury compared to the newer BJC due to renovations in the 2000s and investments into the building. It contains a museum, merchandise stores and features that feel like a professional environment rather than a college venue. The Bryce Jordan Center, much like the program it houses, feels like it has an identity crisis, holding back its potential.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a large donor base, a large arena to work with and some of the most passionate sports fans in the country. The school has everything needed to foster a program that can reach the heights of the Wolverines. But to do so, they must be willing to invest in basketball like Michigan to build a tradition that can withstand struggles and place Penn State in the upper class of college basketball.</p>\n                <p>However, the process won\u2019t be quick. Mike Rhoades continually talks about how the path to success in the NCAA is utilizing the transfer portal to build an older, experienced roster.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have to have a level of urgency in the program to move forward, and I'll do that,\u201d Rhoades said on Jan. 27. \u201cThe culture of college basketball now is to get older quicker.\u201d</p>\n                <p>However, that is unsustainable for a program like Penn State, which lacks the foundation to replenish those assets yearly. If Penn State wants to truly become a contender long-term, it has to start from the ground up, rather than putting band-aids on a terminal illness. The quick fix isn\u2019t compatible with the problem at hand.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has successfully built wrestling, volleyball and hockey into national mainstays over the last two decades and rebuilt a football program from sanctions unheard of at the time. The road to relevancy in college basketball will never get easier, but it's never too late to start climbing a mountain that won\u2018t move itself out of the way.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Penn State coming out victorious on Thursday was a tough task in itself. The Nittany Lions were entering a hostile environment at the Crisler Center against the No. 2 team in the country, Michigan.</p>\n                <p>This doesn\u2019t even factor in that Penn State was without key impact players, which left the team with just eight players.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019re undermanned,\u201d Mike Rhoades said. \u201cTheir size and length really hurt us early, and they got it going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State scored the first two points of the game, and proceeded to give up the next 15, and Michigan didn\u2019t look back from there.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe really made it hard on ourselves early in the game and put ourselves in a hole,\u201d Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>The biggest player missing from the lineup \u2014 literally and metaphorically \u2014 was 7-footer Ivan Juri\u0107, who played a big role in Penn State\u2019s close loss to the Wolverines to begin 2026.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions fell to the Wolverines, 74-72, on Jan. 6, with Juri\u0107 scoring 20 points and four rebounds. The Zagreb, Croatia, native was 6-of-13 from the field and 2-of-5 from behind the arc.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously, they\u2019re injury-depleted,\u201d Michigan coach Dusty May said. \u201cJuri\u0107 had his way with us up there. We were looking for the challenge to see if we could do a better job on him because he\u2019s strong, he punishes switches, he made a couple threes against us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Juri\u0107 out of the lineup, and Sa\u0161a Ciani also ruled out before the game, Penn State started Josh Reed at center, lining up against 7-foot-3 Aday Mara for the opening tip-off.</p>\n                <p>When the 6-foot-8 forward wasn\u2019t the big man on the court, true freshman Justin Houser was the big man. Houser tallied the most minutes in a single game in his freshman season with 21.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, the Nittany Lions didn\u2019t have any answer for the paint presence of the Wolverines. Mara tallied 11 points and six rebounds, while 6-foot-9 forward Morez Johnson Jr. scored 12 points with eight rebounds.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen we played them at our place, I thought we out-toughed them and outplayed them, but we didn\u2019t win the game,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThey just beat us in all facets of the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Penn State didn\u2019t have any answers for Michigan\u2019s offense, allowing 110 points, the Wolverines seemingly had every answer for the Nittany Lions\u2019 offense until the game was out of reach.</p>\n                <p>The difference in the two defensive units wasn\u2019t close, as Michigan out-rebounded Penn State 44-21. This led to 22 second-chance points compared to the Nittany Lions\u2019 six.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t stop them either,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThey got themselves going, and they really scored a lot of (points). I mean, they hit a bunch of threes, but they really scored around the basket and that had us leaking.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades hopes to \u201chave (Juri\u0107) for the next game, when Penn State takes on USC. A unit that was fully depleted ultimately didn\u2019t stand much of a chance against a Michigan unit that\u2019s now 21-1.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe knew the situation we were in,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI felt we had to make 10 to 12 threes to give ourselves a chance today, and we didn\u2019t, but we didn\u2019t stop them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "How Matt Campbell is instilling core values into his version of Penn State",
    "author": "Lexie Linderman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Every morning, Matt Campbell parks his Ford Explorer in the Lasch Building parking lot and heads inside. The \u201cwhirlwind,\u201d as he called it, of the last two months has somewhat settled down, although he\u2019s still got a few more weeks on the road recruiting.</p>\n                <p>As Campbell walks through the halls of his new home, a family has somehow already been built. Penn State lost 50 players to the transfer portal and had just two 2026 signees, but Campbell and his staff put their heads down, meeting every day to discuss roster outlook.</p>\n                <p>Who was staying, who was leaving \u2014 they went through all of it all the time. But as Campbell looked to fill the holes and form a roster, he made one thing clear: If you want to be a Nittany Lion, you better embody the traits required of one.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like we went with the mentality of not wavering from who we want this football team to be,\u201d Campbell said Tuesday. \u201cWhat are the value systems of character, and young men that love the sport of football, young men that love Penn State, and I would say, most importantly, young men that understand the value of an education from this institution. Those core values were really critical for us to kind of build this football team forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It was the same required values for the staff, most of whom have an unwavering loyalty to Campbell. Offensive line coach Ryan Clanton called his boss \u201cthe best head coach in the nation\u201d without hesitation \u2014 the two have only been working together for three seasons, with 2026 set to be his fourth.</p>\n                <p>But it doesn\u2019t feel that way to Clanton. Campbell treats him the same now as he did on Day 1, and Clanton knows that\u2019s hard to find in today\u2019s era of college football, so he certainly doesn\u2019t take it for granted.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt felt like a family the day I arrived. It's never been different,\u201d Clanton said. \u201cIn all the years I've worked for him, it's never been like, \u2018well, I thought he was like this, and he's really like that.\u2019 He drives a Ford Explorer, you know, he's just like a normal dude, right?\u201d</p>\n                <p>The most loyal of them all is offensive coordinator Taylor Mouser, who was working at Little Caesars 12 years ago and calling every school in the country trying to find someone that would take a chance on him, even if it was just in the smallest role available.</p>\n                <p>Campbell was the only one who answered. Since then, Mouser has been with Campbell.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat that guy has done for me in my life, I'd still be at Little Caesars if it wasn't for coach Campbell, and I don't forget that,\u201d Mouser said. \u201cAnd it doesn't matter if he's made me the GA or he's made me the offensive recruiting quality control, whatever it is. I've tried to do it all just to repay him back for being the only guy that returned my phone call.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mouser and Clanton\u2019s devotion trickles down to every member of the staff, especially those who came from Iowa State. Safeties coach Deon Broomfield said Campbell has helped him learn and grow as a father and a husband, while quarterbacks coach Jake Waters knows he\u2019s working with a guy he loves and trusts.</p>\n                <p>Those relationships caught defensive line coach Ikaika Malloe\u2019s eye when defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn asked him to move cross country to Penn State. Malloe even drew similarities between Campbell and former Washington head coach Chris Petersen, who Malloe spent three seasons coaching under.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA guy that I hold dear to my heart is Chris Petersen. And his whole foundation was relationships, and that's what that guy is all about,\u201d Malloe said. \u201cSo I was excited to be a part of that and kind of join that, his philosophy, and the way he does it is very old school. It really is. You kind of earn your keep, and you get up and you work.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s often said that players are a reflection of their coaches, and coaches are a reflection of their players. And that\u2019s exactly how Campbell wants it. He\u2019s set on embodying the history and values of Penn State \u2014 unselfishness, integrity, humility, class and culture.</p>\n                <p>But Campbell also knows culture isn\u2019t built in a day, and it isn\u2019t just a word to throw around. \u201cIt\u2019s how you live, it\u2019s how you act, it\u2019s how you carry yourself,\u201d he says. And he\u2019s ready to inject that into a Penn State football program that lost it a year ago.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe sit in the proudest football tradition in all of college football. Do we understand that it's about those that came before us?\u201d Campbell said. \u201cDo we understand what we play for is bigger than us? Man, do we understand all the other things that come with football? Situational football, get in the best shape, playing for each other, all things that are critically important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Position preview | Penn State baseball acquires new infielders through transfer portal",
    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State enters 2026 off its best season under coach Mike Gambino after going 33-23 with a 15-15 Big Ten record. A major part of the success was both stellar infield play and consistent hitting in the lineup.</p>\n                <p>However, after losing key players to the draft and graduation, Gambino looked to the transfer portal for talented additions. Along with the freshman class, the portal brought in several infielders who have the chance to fill much-needed voids.</p>\n                <p>The only certainty in the infield for Gambino is Bryce Molinaro starting at third base. Molinaro was drafted by the Washington Nationals, yet he elected to return for his junior year. The Drums, Pennsylvania, native started all 56 games at third base last season. He finished with a .267 batting average and 61 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt junior\u2019s RBI count sat at second all-time for a Nittany Lion in a single season.</p>\n                <p>The opposite corner was home to both Joe Jaconski and Cole Wagner throughout the season. The 2025 campaign marked Jaconski\u2019s last as he used all years of eligibility.</p>\n                <p>With both consistent hitters gone, many possibilities begin surfacing for the first base position. The front-runner for the open spot is Michael Anderson. The Havertown, Pennsylvania, native returns to his home state after spending his junior season with Arkansas. However, he last played a full season in his sophomore year at Rhode Island.</p>\n                <p>The senior finished with a .252 batting average and hit 13 home runs before going to Arkansas.</p>\n                <p>As for the middle infield, Gambino has a variety of returning and new players he could use at both positions. Jayden Davis could make an impact in his first year at Penn State, coming from a competitive SEC group. The Cookeville, Tennessee, native\u2019s best season with Vanderbilt came his sophomore year, where he hit .315 with 38 RBIs. His most recent season was cut short by surgery after an April injury.</p>\n                <p>With second base being his primary position and being a senior addition from the portal, Davis could hold the starting role at second for Gambino\u2019s unit.</p>\n                <p>Shortstop seems to be up in the air after Ryan Weingartner was drafted to the St. Louis Cardinals. Weingartner started all 56 games at shortstop, leaving possible competition for the vacant position.</p>\n                <p>Spencer Barnett could potentially come out of that competition with the new starting job. Barnett had a batting average of .278 and 26 RBIs after his last season with West Virginia. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, native displays versatility as he has played second base, shortstop and third base throughout his career.</p>\n                <p>Although finding more time at second and third base, Barnett has given up fewer errors at shortstop.</p>\n                <p>The rest of the infield consists of freshmen and new players from the portal who could use this season to learn and improve for next season. They could also be potentially called in as a backup option.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Penn State men\u2019s basketball got its first Big Ten victory of the season last week against Minnesota and looked to continue its momentum against No. 2 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were unable to do so as they lost 110-69. The Wolverines dominated the entire game as they outscored the blue and white 56-24 in the opening half.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started off with the first basket by Freddie Dillione V, and then proceeded to get outscored 15-0, leading to a timeout on the floor with the Nittany Lions trailing 15-2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got its next points of the night from a Melih Tunca free throw attempt with 12:18 left in the first half. Dillione V put the squad on his back offensively, but anytime he scored a basket Michigan would answer back.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions offense was struggling with Kayden Mingo scoring his first points of the game with just under six minutes left in the half. Meanwhile, Michigan big man WIll Tschetter was spreading the ball all over the court as he had back-to-back assists on two-straight three pointers.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got bullied all around the court. The Nittany Lions allowed the Wolverines to score seven of the last eight field goals with 3:24 left in the half.</p>\n                <p>Morez Johnson Jr. drove through the entire team on the court, capping it off with a slam dunk, an easy layup and a fade away for three-straight baskets to extend Michigan\u2019s lead to 31. The Wolverines outscored Penn State by 32 in the opening half. The Nittany Lions entered halftime with a 56-24 deficit.</p>\n                <p>Michigan opened the second half on a 7-0 scoring run. Tunca scored the first points for Penn State, again from the free throw line. Michigan\u2019s defense had back-to-back blocks by Aday Mara.</p>\n                <p>Tschetter continued to fool the Nittany Lions as he did all night. The graduate student had a lob to Oscar Goodman for the easy dunk to give the Wolverines a 78-40 lead.</p>\n                <p>Mara continued to showcase his defensive abilities with another big block against Josh Reed. The Wolverines clamped Penn State from beyond the arc as the squad went 2-of-17 from downtown.</p>\n                <p>Penn State made Goodman look like he was the star player on the court. The redshirt freshman tallied six points.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defense was atrocious, allowing the Wolverines to shoot 63% from the field, and just as bad was the blue and white\u2019s offense, which shot 35% from the field.</p>\n                <p>The only decent stat the Nittany Lions had was from the free-throw line; the squad shot 77% from that spot, which was still worse than Michigan\u2019s 88 percent from the line.</p>\n                <p>After his second three-pointer of the game, Tschetter got the Wolverines to 100 points and then over that amount with back-to-back threes. Nimari Burnett was the main source of offense for the Wolverines, shooting 70% from downtown and leading the team in scoring with 31 points, which was half of what Penn State scored as a team.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got outrebounded 44-21 throughout the entirety of the game. Penn State got dominated with even less than a minute in the game, allowing Michigan to score two baskets off of lob passes. Penn State lost by 41, 110-69.</p>\n                <p>Injury report</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were without Ivan Juri\u0107, Eli Rice, Tibor Mirtic and Sasa Ciani for the game.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to the Bryce Jordan Center for a matchup with USC at noon Sunday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State is coming off its closest dual of the season with a 26-12 victory over Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>Now, the Nittany Lions will travel to face Michigan in an expected raucous environment at the Crisler Center. Last season, Penn State shut out the Wolverines, 39-0, in the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how the 2026 edition of the dual sets up.</p>\n                <p>125 pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 26 Diego Sotelo (UM)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl will take on Diego Sotelo for the first time in their careers. Against common opponents, Lilledahl is 15-3, while Sotelo sits at 16-9, giving Lilledahl the advantage.</p>\n                <p>This season, no wrestler has been able to keep up with Lilledahl\u2019s lightning pace as he\u2019s given Penn State the best option to lead off a dual. With the Nittany Lion\u2019s pace, Sotelo will have to stay steady as Lilledahl tends to get started quickly.</p>\n                <p>133 pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. Gauge Botero (UM)</p>\n                <p>After multiple tough matches for Marcus Blaze, the competition lightens up against the Wolverines. Gauge Botero holds a 4-11 record on the season and has struggled to keep up with the top competition.</p>\n                <p>This match could end quickly with Blaze\u2019s low, quick style, and if Lilledahl gets the dual started off on the right foot, Blaze could fully take the life out of the Crisler Center with a quick match.</p>\n                <p>141 pounds: No. 12 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 26 Dylan Ragusin (UM)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis will attempt to get back on the right track after losing by pinfall to Brock Hardy. Davis got out the gates quickly against Hardy, but got into a precarious position, allowing Hardy to take advantage.</p>\n                <p>Davis will face Dylan Ragusin, who\u2019s 6-3 on the season. The two wrestlers have a similar number of matches this season, but Davis has a tendency to come out on top against wrestlers ranked below him.</p>\n                <p>149 pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 13 Lachlan McNeil (UM)</p>\n                <p>The 149-pound bout is a rematch of the NCAA Tournament last season. Shayne Van Ness came out on top with a 7-2 decision against Lachlan McNeil, who was at North Carolina at the time.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness has wrestled on a new level this season and is the current top-ranked wrestler at the weight class. McNeil holds a formidable 11-3 record on the season, but Van Ness is on another level, with the next highest ranked Big Ten wrestler being Maryland\u2019s Carter Young at No. 4.</p>\n                <p>157 pounds: No. 4 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. No. 13 Cameron Catrabone (UM)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke lost his first match of his collegiate career to Antrell Taylor of Nebraska. However, he\u2019ll face Cameron Catrabone, who\u2019s dropped four matches this season.</p>\n                <p>Duke couldn\u2019t get to his offense against Taylor but with a wrestler ranked lower than Taylor\u2019s No. 3 spot, he could find more success and keep the train rolling on an impressive start to his career in a blue and white singlet.</p>\n                <p>Duke has a tendency to send the dual to intermission on a high note, and with Penn State having the higher-ranked wrestler at every weight class, it could happen once again.</p>\n                <p>165 pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. Justin Gates (UM)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink is the reigning national champion and is still undefeated in the 2025-26 season. Mesenbrink will take on unranked Justin Gates with a chance at a quick match.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink has taken the junior-year Levi Haines jump where there\u2019s more of a focus on back points. Against an unranked wrestler, Mesenbrink could earn nearfall points quickly, potentially ending this one early by fall.</p>\n                <p>174 pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 11 Beau Mantanona (UM)</p>\n                <p>Haines will face who Mesenbrink faced last season. Mesenbrink came out victorious with an 18-4 major decision over Beau Mantanona. Haines pinned his opponent last year against Michigan, but will face a much better wrestler in Mantanona.</p>\n                <p>Beau is 14-4 on the season compared to Haines\u2019 15-0 record, maintaining his perfect season. With Haines\u2019 highly ranked victories this season, it won\u2019t be a different look against the Wolverine.</p>\n                <p>184 pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 7 Brock Montanona (UM)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh has continued to grow his dominance this season, and is the lone undefeated wrestler left in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Brock Mantanona is No. 7 in the country but won\u2019t be a different look for Welsh, who has the biggest win of the season over former No. 1 Angelo Ferrari.</p>\n                <p>Welsh\u2019s strength has played a major factor and could play a huge factor again over the Wolverine.</p>\n                <p>197 pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 20 Hayden Walters (UM)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr is the final of four straight No. 1 wrestlers for the Nittany Lions. He\u2019ll take on a wrestler who\u2019s 7-4 on the season. Hayden Walters has yet to face a wrestler to the caliber of Barr, which could cause issues for the Wolverine.</p>\n                <p>Barr is 13-0 on the year and is on a tier of his own in the weight class. He holds the best victory in the class, defeating No. 3 Stephen Little earlier in the season. Returning to his home state, Barr could have a hometown showcase in Michigan.</p>\n                <p>285 pounds: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. No. 5 Taye Ghadiali (UM)</p>\n                <p>It\u2019ll be another major test for Cole Mirasola when he takes on Taye Ghadiali. The Wolverine just defeated Nick Feldman of Ohio State, a wrestler Mirasola lost to last season. Mirasola held a close bout against AJ Ferrari, but couldn\u2019t get over the hump against a top-five wrestler.</p>\n                <p>If Mirasola wants to re-insert himself into the top 10, he\u2019ll need a victory over Ghadiali to create mass parity in the Big Ten at the heavyweight position. Ghadiali\u2019s 16-2 record matches up with most wrestlers around him in the rankings.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Written on a piece of tape on Tessa Janecke\u2019s stick is \u201cBTGC,\u201d an abbreviation for \u201cBe the game changer,\u201d a message her parents would send her in her days of youth hockey, as reported by Kathryn Tappen on the NBC broadcast.</p>\n                <p>Janecke was certainly a game changer in her Olympic debut, recording a pair of assists in the United States\u2019 5-1 win over Czechia.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI tried to just do what I could,\u201d Janecke said during the second intermission. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a little different being at centre now, so it\u2019s more comfortable for me. I\u2019m just trying to play downhill in the [offensive zone] and create opportunities.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The name of the game was \u201cspeed,\u201d for the Americans and lots of it. Performing at such a quick pace and tempo, Team USA was able to maintain possession of the puck for the majority of the opening period.</p>\n                <p>Not only was speed a crucial factor from an offensive perspective, but a defensive one as well. The United States\u2019 defense prevented the Czechia offense from being able to cleanly enter the zone without resorting to dumping the puck. The United States was able to hold the Czechs to just one shot in the first 13 minutes of play.</p>\n                <p>With just under six minutes remaining in the first period, Team USA had a chance to open the scoring after Czechia goaltender Kl\u00e1ra Peslarov\u00e1 came out of her crease to play the puck but mishandled it behind the net.</p>\n                <p>On her way back to the crease she fell to one knee, making a save on a Kelly Pannek shot that deflected off Peslarova\u2019s back. Kirsten Simms nearly buried the loose puck, but Peslarova froze the puck on her side.</p>\n                <p>On a power play following a Dominika L\u00e1skov\u00e1 penalty for an illegal check, Hannah Bilka added another high-danger scoring opportunity for the United States, but Peslarova managed to get her glove down just in time. It seemed like the Americans could do everything but score.</p>\n                <p>Until they did.</p>\n                <p>Laila Edwards sent a one-timer pass from the faceoff dot to Megan Keller, who ripped a slapshot. On its way to the net, it deflected off the stick of Alex Carpenter and through the five-hole of the goalie Peslarova.</p>\n                <p>Not even two minutes into the second period, Czechia reminded United States goaltender Aerin Frankel to stay on her toes. Tereza Plosova skated around Britta Curl and Caroline Harvey and hit the post with her shot on a breakaway.</p>\n                <p>When the red, white and blue came out for the second period, they added another aspect to their already fast-paced game: crisp passes. The Americans seemed to utilize every square inch of the ice\u2019s surface, constantly moving the puck around, and it played a factor in increasing their lead.</p>\n                <p>From behind the cage, Janecke handled the puck and fired a quick centering pass to Joy Dunne, who scored her first Olympic goal to put Team USA up 2-0.</p>\n                <p>After a battle along the boards, less than two minutes later, Janecke fired a quick-look backhanded pass to Hayley Scamurra, who turned, battled a Czech skater, and fired the puck under Peslarova\u2019s left pad, giving the United States a 3-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Team USA continued to keep its foot on the gas, but hit a slight bump in the road on the way to victory.</p>\n                <p>Barbora Ju\u0159\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 was in the penalty box serving the final seconds of her two-minute minor for interference when the Americans sent a shot that rebounded off Peslarova and right on to the stick of Nat\u00e1lie Ml\u00fdnkov\u00e1. With Jurickova out of the box, Miynkova sent a pass up the length of the ice to Jurickova, who beat Frankel low-blocked to put Czechia on the board.</p>\n                <p>United States captain Hilary Knight added one more to the American lead with the 13th goal of her Olympic career, putting her third on the women\u2019s all-time list behind Natalie Darwitz and Katie King, who are tied with 14.</p>\n                <p>The Americans started the final period down a skater while Edwards served the remaining time on her tripping penalty that carried over from the second period.</p>\n                <p>After a successful penalty kill, Team USA continued to own the game in a controversial fashion. A potential missed tripping call against the United States resulted in Andrea Trnkov\u00e1 losing the puck, turning it over to Scamurra, who put Team USA up 5-1 with her second goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>The Americans had another power-play opportunity in the final minutes of the game and failed to score, but what they had already done was good enough to earn victory in their first game of the Winter Olympics.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The United States continues its preliminary round at 10:40 a.m. EST on Saturday when it faces Finland, its opponent in the semifinal round of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Czechia will look to bounce back at 8:40 a.m. EST on Friday against Switzerland</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS COVERAGE</p>",

Exactly one minute later, Italian captain Nadia Mattivi delivered an accurate pass to forward Kayla Tutino, who equalized the contest for the Italians 1-1.</p>\n                <p>As the second period began, the Italians started to dominate puck possession and had complete control over the neutral zone. In the closing minutes of the second period, Kristin Della Rovere carried the puck into the French zone and fired a shot that went off Philbert's pad.

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Germany and Sweden opened up the women\u2019s hockey event at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, and suited up for the blue and gold was Penn State sophomore Nicole Hall and former Nittany Lion Jessica Adolfsson.</p>\n                <p>Neither skater made it to the score sheet, but certainly had an impact in Sweden\u2019s 4-1 win over Germany.</p>\n                <p>Discipline was non-existent in the first period with three penalties called in the first 20 minutes of play, two against the Germans and one against the Swedes.</p>\n                <p>What Sweden lacked in discipline, it made up for in defense with multiple players sacrificing their bodies to block shots and redirect pucks, including Adolfsson. Sweden held Germany to just six shots in the first period.</p>\n                <p>Despite Germany being outshot in the first period by Sweden 14-6, the Germans got on the board first.</p>\n                <p>Just over 30 second into the power play after Sweden\u2019s Sara Hjalmarsson was called for slashing, Germany\u2019s Katarina Jobst-Smith rang one off the iron and past the Swedish goaltender Ebba Svensson Traff for the first goal of the Winter Games.</p>\n                <p>Even with the 1-0 lead, the Germans failed to build on the momentum. Sweden continued to test Germany's goalie Sandra Abstreiter with one-timers, but she managed to come up with an answer each time.</p>\n                <p>Sweden also had an offensive strategy of crashing the net which led to its first goal of the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>Just moments after a second unsuccessful power play, Sweden\u2019s Jenna Raunio ripped a shot from the blue line. Felizia Wikner Zienkiewicz redirected the shot on net and Abstreiter made the initial save, but Lina Ljungblom put in the rebound past the sprawled-out netminder to tie the game.</p>\n                <p>Hall was on Ljungblom\u2019s heels for Sweden\u2019s first goal, and nearly gave it the lead later in the period. Cutting towards the net with just over a minute remaining in the opening period, Hall had a centering pass sent her way, but got tied up with Germany\u2019s Daria Gleissner in front of the net as the puck slid to the corner.</p>\n                <p>The penalty trend continued in the second period, though not as sudden as it did in the first. Just over five minutes into the period, Sweden\u2019s Hanna Olsson drew a tripping penalty against Celina Haider, giving the three crowns its third power play of the game.</p>\n                <p>Compared to its first two power plays, the result was different but the name in the goal column wasn\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>With 30 seconds remaining on the man-advantage, the Swedes executed a set of tic-tac-toe passes. From atop of the far-side faceoff circle, Mira Jungaker fired a cross-ice pass to Sofie Lundin, who immediately sent it to Lisa Johansson, who fired a shot off the pads of Abstreiter. Similar to her first goal, Ljungblom cut to the net and snuck a backhand shot past the left skate of Abstreiter and into the back of the net to put Sweden up 2-1.</p>\n                <p>After assisting on Sweden\u2019s first power-play goal, Jungaker was responsible for scoring its second goal with the extra skater. From the edge of the trapezoid, Johansson sent a pass to the open Jungaker who fired a shot from the top of the near-side faceoff circle through traffic and straight to the net to extend the Swedish lead to 3-1.</p>\n                <p>On the other side of the ice, Svensson Traff faced just three shots on goal in the second period, but made a spectacular save with the left pad on a backhand shot from Mira Hallin after the German executed a perfect toe drag to get past Adolfsson.</p>\n                <p>The German offense looked its best in the third period, matching its shot total from the first period in a fraction of the time. Germany had multiple scoring chances to cut away at its deficit, but couldn\u2019t get one by Svenson Traff.</p>\n                <p>The 21-year-old netminder was unbeatable after the first goal she allowed and handled the increased offensive pressure from the Germans, including making a save despite being screened by the German forward Julie Schiefer.</p>\n                <p>Sweden added another goal to its total after Hilda Svensson sent a centering pass to Thea Johansson, who effortlessly put it past Abstreiter from in front of the crease to make it a 4-1 game.</p>\n                <p>After nearly scoring in the final minutes of the opening period, Hall had another scoring opportunity late in the third. She ripped a shot that deflected off Abstreiter\u2019s glove, and Josefin Bouveng couldn\u2019t bury the loose puck.</p>\n                <p>Germany will regroup and face Japan at 6:10 a.m. EST on Saturday while Sweden looks to extend its win streak against Matilde Fantin and Team Italy at 8:40 a.m. EST on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Ava Crawley | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Drum, Penn State\u2019s Student Black Caucus\u2019 Magazine, hosted an art gallery on Wednesday in the Eisenhower Auditorium. Featuring sculptures, paintings, photographs, videos and virtual reality exhibits, the auditorium was transformed by original student artwork highlighting the diversity of the Black diaspora.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere are so many things that are trying to silence Black and Indigenous voices right now,\u201d Diane Akpovwa, a writer for The Drum said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have this centralized space where we can feel safe and discuss ideas that are complex and uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Akpovwa, a fourth-year studying human-centered design and development, displayed multiple personal pieces throughout the auditorium including a virtual reality experience showing Nigeria\u2019s current economic conditions, a painting focused on the return of Indigenous African knowledge to its rightful owners and a sculpture series portraying the ever-changing standards for Black Queer bodies. While every piece differs in message and medium, they all collectively celebrate Black art.</p>\n                <p>Like Akpovwa\u2019s pieces, other students' artwork were carefully placed around the gallery. Among the artwork were plaques explaining each piece, vibrant charcuterie boards and curated Nigerian drinks. After weeks of preparations, Ruth Tefera\u2019s vision came to life.</p>\n                <p>Tefera, editor-in-chief of The Drum and a third-year student studying information sciences and technology, planned this gallery for months alongside Sita Frederick.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI can\u2019t lie, it was definitely a long process,\u201d Tefera said. \u201cOne of the hardest things was the curation aspect of it, reaching out to students that I saw were doing amazing work and convincing them that their work was good enough to be exhibited was challenging. I feel like a lot of artists don't see themselves as good enough to be in these spaces.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Frederick, the director of the performing arts, felt blessed to get the opportunity to work with Tefera and other students on The Drum.</p>\n                <p>\"It\u2019s honestly really exciting to partner with The Drum on this,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to do something like this, so to see students take it and run with it is totally inspiring to me. It is a collaboration with a student group that has a vision for how they want to create a community for Black students and for allies to come into this space and celebrate liberation, so it\u2019s really important to me as a woman of color.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Following the exhibit\u2019s successful debut, Tefera hopes to collaborate with the Eisenhower Auditorium again in the near future.</p>\n                <p>The artwork, displayed on the lower level and in the conference room, will remain on display through March, offering more Penn State community members the chance to admire the countless pieces and their different messages.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Alli Satterfield | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>\u201cDancing With the Stars: Live!\u201d brought dance, music and entertainment to the Bryce Jordan Center Wednesday night as fans of the show flocked to see their favorite professional dancers, or pros, live.</p>\n                <p>The performance capitalized on social media trends throughout, using viral songs like \u201cwe can\u2019t be friends (wait for your love),\u201d \u201cWHERE IS MY HUSBAND!\u201d and \u201cOpalite,\u201d while also making reference to the most recent season\u2019s most viral moments. Jenna Johnson\u2019s abs, Val Chmerkovskiy's knee walks and Ezra Sosa\u2019s alleged relationship with celebrity partner Jordan Chiles were all fuel for quips by the co-hosts of the show, Dancing With The Stars pro Emma Slater and celebrity contestant Danielle Fishel.</p>\n                <p>But, the dance performances weren't entirely based in modern, trendy concepts. The show featured a Gatsby-esque set design and one showgirl-themed number to \u201cCopacabana.\u201d The night\u2019s show also made frequent use of its performers\u2019 popularity and sex appeal.</p>\n                <p>Debby Zurinski, who works for Empower Retirement and attended Wednesday\u2019s performance, said her favorite dances were the ones featuring Val Chmerkovskiy. She said she could feel the energy in the room.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe crowd went wild every time Val was up on stage, especially when the men took their shirts off,\u201d Zurinski said. \u201cIt was good. It was fun.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She also noted people of all ages were in attendance \u2014 the entertainment brought generations together and acted as fun for all.</p>\n                <p>A lot of mother and daughter duos flocked to the BJC for the show. Zurinski was there with her sister, who she said is a bigger fan of the television show than she is. But, Zoie McClellan, who is currently a senior in high school, was there with her mom.</p>\n                <p>McClellan said she was so impressed by the length of the show and the intensity it must cause for the dancers.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very [impressive] how the dancers are able to perform so much in one night and remember all of that,\u201d McClellan said.</p>\n                <p>She was also impressed by the quality of each dance and said she enjoyed each of them.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey were all so amazing, I don\u2019t think I could just pick one [favorite],\u201d McClellan said.</p>\n                <p>But, other attendees, like Kimberley Conley, could pick favorites. Conley, like Zurinski, thought the best dance numbers of the night were those featuring Val. She said he is her favorite pro on the show.</p>\n                <p>Chmerkovskiy is just one of the professional dancers that ABC\u2019s Dancing With the Stars has made into a celebrity themselves. His brother Maks and the Arnold Sisters are among others that have transformed their Dancing With the Stars stardom into social media and podcasting fame, as well.</p>\n                <p>Their influence isn\u2019t necessarily new, however. Dancing With the Stars first premiered in 2005, and fans have been taking inspiration from the show since then. Conley, a registered nurse, even became an amateur ballroom dancer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually, when they first started, started taking ballroom lessons, and I do that a little bit on the side.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In its 20 years on the air, the show has inspired a generation of dancers and fans and cultivated a dedicated base of voters. Recently, it\u2019s grown in popularity and this season, it received a record-breaking number of votes \u2014 over half a billion \u2014 according to Slater\u2019s speech during the performance.</p>\n                <p>That energy and hype was evident Wednesday night, as the crowd\u2019s cheers reverberated off the walls of the BJC and the attendees\u2019 dance moves rocked the arena\u2019s seating.</p>\n                <p>The DWTS cast reciprocated that energy through the totality of their performance. They served sharp dance moves and engaging facial expressions to each carefully-chosen song. Each number transitioned into the others and many were reflective of what\u2019s popular right now.</p>\n                <p>In between numbers the cast also kept their audience engaged with jokes, banter and audience participation. One lucky audience-member was even pulled on stage to dance with them during a skit about dance technique enforcement. They drew the audience in the whole time, literally.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a great show with high energy and great costumes and dancing,\u201d Conley said.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "How to stay warm in State College",
    "author": "Lexi Cannan | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Winter in State College hits fast. One day you\u2019re fine, the next you\u2019re freezing and adjusting your whole day.</p>\n                <p>Walking across campus gets harder, warm buildings become a priority and staying comfortable suddenly matters more than anything else. At some point, you stop trying to be cozy and start trying to function.</p>\n                <p>Cold weather changes your priorities. You stop caring about convenience and start caring about what actually works. It\u2019s the little things \u2014 heat, dry hands and not standing outside longer than necessary.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how students can actually get through it.</p>\n                <p>Find warmth and stay there</p>\n                <p>The second you feel warmth, don\u2019t move. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re early, late or pretending to study, warm buildings come first. Standing near vents becomes normal, and once you find a good spot, you don\u2019t tell anyone.</p>\n                <p>You start doing small things just to stay inside. Sitting through a few extra minutes of class. Rereading the same paragraph in the library because the heat is perfect. Taking the long way just to avoid the wind.</p>\n                <p>Leaving a warm building is always a mistake. You open the door, feel the cold hit your face and instantly regret every decision. If a building has good heat, it becomes part of your routine.</p>\n                <p>Hot drinks are just hand warmers</p>\n                <p>The drink itself barely does anything. You can buy coffee, tea or hot chocolate, but half the time it's already cold. You\u2019re really just holding the cup for warmth.</p>\n                <p>You\u2019ll carry that empty cup across campus like it\u2019s still doing something important. It stays in your hand through lectures, hallways and quick stops inside, all for a little extra heat. It only feels okay to throw away once you're fully inside.</p>\n                <p>Showers become a coping mechanism</p>\n                <p>Showers stop being quick. You stand there longer than you need to, just enjoying the heat. The hardest part is turning the water off and realizing you have to exist in cold air again.</p>\n                <p>The foggy mirror is the only proof you were warm at some point. You linger a few extra seconds, hoping the bathroom somehow stays warm forever. Eventually, you step out, immediately regret it and question why winter has to be this dramatic.</p>\n                <p>Hands give up first</p>\n                <p>Cold hands make everything harder. Texting becomes impossible. Your phone doesn\u2019t recognize your touch, so typing gets difficult. You shove your hands into pockets, sleeves, anywhere that might help until you end up grabbing hand warmers from McLanahan\u2019s on the way to class.</p>\n                <p>At that point, warmth isn\u2019t about comfort, it\u2019s about getting anything done. You start seriously considering those texting gloves that claim they work, even though you don\u2019t fully trust them.</p>\n                <p>Typing one text takes forever, autocorrect does whatever it wants and sending anything without mistakes starts to feel like an accomplishment.</p>\n                <p>Going back out is not happening</p>\n                <p>Once you get back home, you\u2019re done going out. You drop your stuff, sit down for \u201cjust a minute,\u201d and suddenly it\u2019s the rest of the night. Any plans you had start feeling optional. Going back outside sounds like too much effort, and staying in just makes more sense.</p>\n                <p>Plans turn into movie nights, warm food and sweats. It\u2019s simple, comfortable and honestly enough. Once you\u2019re settled in, leaving again doesn\u2019t even cross your mind.</p>\n                <p>The night slows down, the heat\u2019s on and everyone relaxes a little. Blankets get pulled out and claimed fast. Nothing exciting happens, and that\u2019s kind of the point. You\u2019re warm, you\u2019re home and you don\u2019t have to go anywhere , which feels like a win.</p>\n                <p>Layering saves you</p>\n                <p>Layering isn\u2019t about style, it\u2019s about options. You add things knowing you\u2019ll probably take them off later. Hat, scarves and gloves come out even if you didn\u2019t plan on wearing them all day. At a certain point, you don't care, you just want to be warm.</p>\n                <p>Scarves end up over your face. Gloves come on and off all day. Once the hat\u2019s on, it stays on. You don\u2019t look great, but you\u2019re warm. It\u2019s worth it.</p>\n                <p>Complaining just happens</p>\n                <p>Talking about how cold it is just becomes normal. It\u2019s the first thing people say when class starts, and everyone gets it.</p>\n                <p>Staying warm isn\u2019t about doing anything special. It\u2019s about getting through the day and making it back inside. That\u2019s the goal. You get to class, walk across campus and get home. If you did that without freezing, you did okay.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

This opens up for a great showdown between a confident Penn State and a really strong LSU team.</p>\n                <p>The No. 3 Tigers have been going strong all season, and had an intense showdown over the weekend against No. 7 Missouri, narrowly winning 197.675-197.500. LSU also defeated two other strong programs, No. 4 UCLA and No. 5 Utah, and tied No. 1 Oklahoma, but fell in the tiebreaker, in the Sprouts Farmers Market Collegiate Quad.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are ranked No. 14 in the NCAA rankings, and although they have been on a winning streak, LSU is a formidable foe with a lot of depth.</p>\n                <p>For the Nittany Lions, having their lineup full of multi-event gymnasts will be their best bet. All-around athletes can cover all of their bases in terms of events, so putting gymnasts like Jessica Johanson, Allison Kaempfer, Dani Latronica and Elizabeth Leary in the lineup will be game changers.</p>\n                <p>LSU has all-around gymnast Kailin Chio, who was named the NCAA Vault Champion with a score of 9.975 and has a season high of 10.000. Chio also got a score of 9.950 on bars and 9.975 on floor. Konnor McClain is another great option for the Tigers this weekend, with season highs of 9.975 on bars, 9.950 on beam and 9.900 on floor. McClain also competed in every meet for LSU during the 2025 season.</p>\n                <p>This matchup will be a battle on bars, with both teams being extremely strong on that apparatus. Penn State has always been notoriously good on the bars, with many of the past meets this season seeing some strong scores posted by its gymnasts. Latronica has a 9.950, Ava Piedrahita has a 9.925, Leary and Johanson both have a 9.825 and Ava Cash and Kaempfer both have a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>LSU gymnasts have a strong history with bars, with the majority of the roster having over a 9.900 for the 2026 season. Courtney Blackson has a high of 9.950, Madison Ulrich has a 9.925 McClain has a 9.950.</p>\n                <p>The bars are most likely where most of the tight numbers will come from, but there is a lot more competition ready to happen all around. Both teams are at the top of their conference, and both rosters are lined with talent. This meet will be one for the books and worthy of the watch.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Brennan Kramp I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Music, one of the world's greatest communicators and most personal art forms, has been allowing artists to express love for generations. Becoming a classically typical theme in music, love in all of its forms has helped propel artists to new fame and peeled the curtain back on them, showing a more vulnerable side to their creativity and musicianship.</p>\n                <p>Even though it\u2019s a near impossible task \u2014 coming up with a short list of the greatest love songs of all time \u2014 here are my top picks to listen and enjoy with your special person.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCant Help Falling In Love\u201d by Elvis Presley</p>\n                <p>A list of greatest love songs without the King\u2019s classic hit would be immediately labeled incomplete \u2014 if not, inaccurate. It\u2019s almost a shame how commercialized this song has become due to its undying popularity as a classic love song.</p>\n                <p>What gives this song its longevity is largely due to the colossal impact Elvis Presley had on music culture as a whole, but also because it\u2019s one of the most prominent songs in his discography where he moves himself into a completely different state of mind to sing with that level of intention and passion. Much to the same effect real love has on you.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d by Al Green</p>\n                <p>The beginning track to Al Green\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d album is by far one of the most memorable soul-groove love songs to date. Whether you realize it or not, you\u2019ve heard this song. Be it in a movie, TV show \u2014 or you\u2019re just a fan of good music \u2014 you\u2019ve heard the mellow swoon of Al Green\u2019s voice. It\u2019s an incredibly bold-faced song that, lyrically, is comfortingly honest and vulnerable.</p>\n                <p>The very first lyrics read, \u201cI\u2019m so in love with you / Whatever you want to do is alright with me / Cause you make me feel so brand new.\u201d If that isn\u2019t a perfect representation of honest love then nothing else is.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d by Taylor Swift</p>\n                <p>For the rabid Swifties out there who have gotten this far and are still wondering where their musical-hero is on a list of love songs, fret not.</p>\n                <p>Taylor Swift is one of the greatest musical superstars to ever walk the Earth \u2014 breaking virtually every record from touring attendance to streams to practically sweeping through the Grammy Awards at one point or another, Swift has built a large reputation and discography off of a bountiful amount of love songs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou Belong With Me,\u201d was a radio hit in its release back in 2008, reaching No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and being certified platinum six times over. A youthful, jealous high school anthem, written as if it were pulled from the plot of a Hallmark movie, \u201cYou Belong With Me,\u201d spoke to an entire generation of young adults sitting in their poster covered rooms messaging their special person over AOL and fusing their spirits to the lyrics of Swift's smash hit.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYesterday\u201d by The Beatles</p>\n                <p>It is nearly impossible to pinpoint what the greatest Beatles love song really is. Every one of their albums seemingly has about three to four tracks that could contend for the number one spot. However, the one that seems to be in every debate, surrounded by a plethora of other amazing Beatles\u2019 ballads, is their 1965 classic, \u201cYesterday.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The song is, to put it simply, happy and sad. The lyrics show a starkly contrasting view on love with McCartney first singing, \u201cYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,\u201d then going on to sing, \u201cWhy she had to go, I don\u2019t know, she wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n                <p>To have McCartney explain it, \u201cyesterday\u201d when \u201cshe\u201d was there, \u201clove was such an easy game to play\u201d and now he\u2019s \u201cnot half the man\u201d he used to be. It\u2019s a song that gives a glimpse into the true power love can hold over someone, and the unfortunate despair it can cause when it disappears.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFade Into You\u201d by Mazzy Star</p>\n                <p>Maybe the most overplayed wedding song in the history of weddings (for understandable reasons), Mazzy Star\u2019s 1993 album opener \u201cFade Into You,\u201d has been the essential slow dance song for anyone brave enough to go up and ask someone.</p>\n                <p>Gaining its popularity from a fantastic uprising of early 90s female rockstars, \u201cFade Into You\u201d is a relatively minimal song, lyrically, but the ensemble of a low-tempo acoustic guitar, piano, slide guitar and tambourine, all make for an extremely intimate and innocent track that will make both you and your partner absolutely swoon.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>There may still be snow on the ground in Happy Valley, but it\u2019s softball weather in Clearwater, Florida, and that\u2019s where Penn State will head for its opening weekend.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are set to play five games in their second-straight appearance at the NFCA Leadoff Classic. The blue and white are coming off a 25-27 campaign, where it reached the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will kick off the 2026 season with a Friday doubleheader against Missouri and Boston College.</p>\n                <p>Missouri</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will open with a 10 a.m. matchup versus Missouri. The Tigers finished 2025 at the bottom of the SEC standings with a 25-31 record.</p>\n                <p>Missouri posted the conference\u2019s lowest offensive production with a .255 batting average and lost lots of key bats to graduation and the transfer portal. However, the Tigers also added a major offensive boost in senior East Carolina transfer Emma Jackson.</p>\n                <p>Last season, the Chincoteague, Virginia, native hit .326, with 58 hits, 54 RBI and a program record 21 home runs. Jackson is a two-time Second-Team All AAC selection and will look to boost Missouri\u2019s offense in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Junior Stefania Abruscato is the Tigers' top returning run producer after totaling 19 RBI in 2025. The Smithtown, New York, native also posted a .244 batting average, 38 hits and a team-high 15 doubles.</p>\n                <p>Offense fueled Penn State in 2025 as the Nittany Lions finished sixth in the Big Ten with a .329 batting average. The blue and white bring back its best offensive weapon, Brooke Klosowicz.</p>\n                <p>The junior utility player set single-season records with 23 doubles and 53 RBI, while recording a team-high 65 hits and striking out just 11 times.</p>\n                <p>In the circle, Missouri finished 2025 in the bottom half of the SEC with a 3.74 ERA. The Tigers lost their ERA leader and primary closer, Taylor Pannell, to the transfer portal, but return starters Cierra Harrison and Marissa McCann.</p>\n                <p>McCann went 10-12 with a 3.69 ERA and a team-high 113 strikeouts. Harrison was Missouri\u2019s only pitcher with a winning record, finishing 10-8, with a 3.94 ERA and 89 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns Abigail Britton, who logged the second-most appearances and innings last season. Britton finished 2025 with a 6-10 record, 5.89 ERA and 79 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>As a staff, the blue and white had the highest ERA in the Big Ten at 5.76.</p>\n                <p>Boston College</p>\n                <p>Penn State will face Boston College at 1 p.m. to close Friday's doubleheader. It\u2019ll be the Eagles\u2019 second game of the day after a morning matchup against Eastern Kentucky</p>\n                <p>Boston College finished 22-29 last year and missed the ACC Tournament after placing last in the conference.</p>\n                <p>The Eagles finished near the bottom of the ACC in both hitting and pitching, posting a .256 batting average and 4.87 ERA.</p>\n                <p>The factor that both the Eagles and Nittany Lions have in common is that both have young teams. Boston College has only four seniors on its roster, and Penn State has just two. Two of those seniors, Janis Espinoza and Meghan Schouten, are the Eagles\u2019 best returning bats.</p>\n                <p>In 42 appearances, Espinoza hit .275, with 28 hits and 12 RBI. Schouten is Boston College's top returning run producer after recording 18 RBI last season.</p>\n                <p>Two hitters to watch for the Nittany Lions are junior Michela Barbenente and sophomore Natalie Lieto. In 2025, Barbenente hit .284, with 33 hits and 36 RBI, while Lieto batted .329 with 49 hits and 30 RBI.</p>\n                <p>Boston College returns its top two pitchers in sophomore Bailey Kendziorski and junior Kelly Colleran, who combined for 281.1 innings last season. Kendziorski posted the team's lowest ERA at 4.51, while Colleran led the Eagles with 89 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State counters with junior pitchers Bridget Nemeth and McKenna Young. Nemeth missed last season, but served as the Nittany Lions\u2019 ace in 2024, finishing 23-8 with a 1.77 ERA and 202 strikeouts. Young, a transfer from South Dakota, recorded a 2.46 ERA and a 14-8 record in 2025.</p>\n                <p>One storyline to note is that Boston College is in its first season under former Saint Francis head coach Beth Krysiak. Penn State junior shortstop Kaylie Walters spent her freshman season at Saint Francis under Krysiak.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s 2026 campaign is rapidly approaching, with a doubleheader against Missouri and Boston College on Friday. Yet, there\u2019s still some debate about who\u2019s going to be starting behind the plate for the Nittany Lions this season.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have four catchers on the roster between freshman Kirsten Finarelli, sophomore Macy Chamberlin and seniors Jordyn Jochims and Madison Seidel. While there are arguments for all players, the starting position will likely come down to Chamberlin or Seidel.</p>\n                <p>Chamberlin started immediately as a freshman for coach Clarisa Crowell in 2025 and delivered an impressive campaign until a midseason injury sidelined her for the rest of the season. The Wausen, Ohio, native started 20 of her 26 appearances, slashing an excellent .321 average, 17 hits and 11 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>The five-foot-eight catcher also flashed her glove with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage, including nine assists and 68 putouts. Before arriving at Happy Valley, Chamberlin ranked as the No. 22 overall prospect and No. 15 catcher in the 2024 class, so she holds massive upside and potential.</p>\n                <p>However, she faces steady competition as Seidel delivered the most impressive season of her collegiate career in 2025, reaching new single-season career-highs in every statistic. The Hilltown, Pennsylvania, native was the primary catcher after Chamberlin\u2019s injury and started 33 of her 43 appearances.</p>\n                <p>The senior finished last season with a steady .247 average, 23 hits and 15 RBI. Seidel was also impressive defensively, boasting a 1.000 fielding percentage, with 10 assists and 156 putouts, second most on the team.</p>\n                <p>As both Chamberlin and Seidel bat and throw right, their playing time likely won\u2019t be decided based on which opposing pitcher the Nittany Lions face. If Crowell wants a heavier bat in the lineup, I\u2019d lean towards starting Chamberlin.</p>\n                <p>While Chamberlin\u2019s sample size is smaller, she delivered a .528 slugging percentage and three home runs in that time span compared to Seidel\u2019s .409 slugging percentage and four home runs in more games.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, I could see Crowell starting Seidel because of her experience. With half of the pitching staff being freshmen, Crowell might want a steady presence behind the plate.</p>\n                <p>Another argument for starting Seidel would be letting her carry last season\u2019s momentum into 2026. If Crowell doesn\u2019t give Seidel many opportunities in the beginning of the season, her bat may go cold when she\u2019s inserted into the lineup.</p>\n                <p>Penn State also might want to ease Chamberlin back into playing full-time after her injury last season. It may help to have her not be the primary catcher right away, and instead get some reps and build confidence behind Seidel starting.</p>\n                <p>I ultimately see Crowell mostly splitting the starter role between the two catchers to start the season, and don\u2019t see there being a clear-cut primary catcher until Big Ten play begins in March. The loaded nonconference schedule to begin Penn State\u2019s campaign is the perfect opportunity for Crowell to swap around the catchers and ultimately decide who the starter is for the rest of the season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have doubleheaders on Friday and Saturday, so I expect Chamberlin and Seidel to split starts this weekend. However, Sunday\u2019s matchup against Auburn may give some insight into who might be the starter, as that\u2019s the only game of the day.</p>\n                <p>It will be interesting to see how the starting catcher position shapes up throughout the season, and either way, each player is talented, so Penn State should have no problems filling the role.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Staff Predictions | How does Penn State softball stack up entering 2026?",
    "author": "The Daily Collegian Softball Staff",
    "description": "<p>Penn State softball embarks on a new campaign after a record-breaking 2025 season, and the anticipation is high for a team with maximum opportunity to improve its standing in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how our staff sees the season going.</p>\n                <p>Gianna Dowling: 35-18</p>\n                <p>With lots of experienced talent on both sides of the ball, I believe Penn State will improve from 2025 and put itself in a position to make an NCAA Regional appearance for the second time in three years.</p>\n                <p>I think the Nittany Lions will go 2-3 in their opening weekend at the NFCA Leadoff Classic, falling to Missouri, BYU and Auburn. However, I think the blue and white will follow with an undefeated weekend at the Houston/HCU Invitational.</p>\n                <p>I have Penn State earning key non-conference wins over Houston, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Oregon State.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions open Big Ten play with a tough outing, taking a West Coast trip to face preseason No. 5 Oregon. I think the blue and white will leave Eugene winless, but will bounce back with a series win over Wisconsin in its Big Ten home opener.</p>\n                <p>The other three conference series that I see Penn State coming up short in are those against Northwestern, Ohio State and Nebraska, who, along with Oregon, all finished top-five in the Big Ten rankings in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, I think Penn State will finish conference play with a 13-11 record to put themselves in the middle of the standings and potentially make a run in the Big Ten Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Brielle Gari: 30-22</p>\n                <p>As softball season begins, the Nittany Lions look to improve. I believe in their improvement as well.</p>\n                <p>Having the first month of the season in nonconference tournaments, I believe it will give the blue and white wiggle room to figure out what works best for their squad. The do\u2019s and don\u2019ts early on in the season against smaller programs.</p>\n                <p>For the opening weekend, I would say Penn State goes 3-2. Falling to BYU and Boston College. As well as in the following weeks to UCF and Pitt. Facing off against Notre Dame in the SpaceU classic will be an interesting watch, as it will preview how the Nittany Lions fare against the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>In the final week of February, Penn State travels to Knoxville for the Tennessee Invitational. Facing off against the home team, the Lady Vols, this will be the Nittany Lions' test in potential postseason play against a powerhouse SEC program.</p>\n                <p>Going into the conference series matchups, I think the blue and white will split the series 50-50. Having success at Rutgers and in Champaign against Illinois. But having some difficulty on the road in Eugene, Oregon, or for the Big Ten regular season finale at home against Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>It's all about consistency that leads to improvement. Last year, the longest winning streak the Nittany Lions could hold onto was 5. Against conference opponents, consistency is key. Penn State must do well within the conference to make it to the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Beres: 36-17</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions head into the new campaign with hopes of reaching the NCAA Regionals for the second time in three seasons after missing the postseason in 2025. With a plethora of returners and key players back from injury, I see Penn State having a successful bounce-back season.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white will go 3-2 at the NFCA Leadoff Classic, winning favorable games over Boston College and Eastern Kentucky, while also pulling off a season opener win over Missouri.</p>\n                <p>I think Penn State rides the momentum and follows up that road trip by going undefeated at the Houston Invitational the next weekend. Following those games, I see the Nittany Lions going 4-1 at the SPACEU Classic, with their sole loss coming against UCF.</p>\n                <p>The Tennessee Invitational offers the blue and white its first big test of the season against preseason No. 4 Tennessee. I don\u2019t think Penn State pulls off the upset in either game, but the Nittany Lions will win their other three games in this invitational.</p>\n                <p>I have Penn State sweeping its first home series of the season before traveling cross country for a tough trip against Oregon State and preseason No. 5 Oregon. The Nittany Lions will start the road trip strong with a win over Oregon State, but will drop two of their three games against the Ducks in Eugene.</p>\n                <p>However, the squad will bounce back with a series win over Wisconsin in the Big Ten home opener. I think Penn State will pull off some upsets in conference play and position itself for a shot at a run in the Big Ten Tournament, finishing in the middle of the conference.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Keira Albert | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 14 Penn State is gearing up for a busy weekend against Saint Francis as it looks to take back some wins.</p>\n                <p>The first match of the series is the THON Match from Rec Hall at 7 p.m. Friday, but the Nittany Lions will hit the road for the next game, which will be played in DeGol Arena at 6 p.m. Friday.</p>\n                <p>After taking back-to-back losses against Hawai\u2019i last weekend, the blue and white have officially lost four straight games. Remaining at No. 14, the Nittany Lions have the chance to get some wins under their belt as they face the unranked Red Flash.</p>\n                <p>After a couple of tough matches, the odds could be in favor of Penn State.</p>\n                <p>These two are no strangers to one another. Last season, the teams met twice. And both times, the blue and white left the court with a 3-0 win. Similarly, the teams met twice in 2024, and Penn State left the victor both times.</p>\n                <p>Despite the four-game losing streak, it hasn\u2019t been all bad for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Currently, the Nittany Lions are No. 13 in the NCAA in blocks per set. With players like Owen Rose and Gaige Gabriel, both of whom rank in the top 50 in the stat, the blue and white definitely have the one-up in this area of play.</p>\n                <p>However, Saint Francis edges out Penn State in aces per set. Currently, the Red Flash are No. 23 in the NCAA in that very category, whereas the Nittany Lions trail far behind at No. 33.</p>\n                <p>Serving has seemed to be a consistent struggle for the blue and white. Last weekend, it only produced seven total service aces across two matches. More notably, it came up with a total of 29 service errors across both games.</p>\n                <p>While Gabriel has eight service aces so far, making him runner-up for the most of the squad, he leads the Nittany Lions in service errors with 29 on the year.</p>\n                <p>In order to have a different outcome than the last four matches, it is crucial that the quality of the blue and white\u2019s serves increase.</p>\n                <p>Defense has been strong for the blue and white. However, libero Ryan Merk has been consistently reliable. With 60 digs on the season, the redshirt senior ranks No. 22 in the NCAA in digs per set, currently averaging about 2.14 per set.</p>\n                <p>Merk isn\u2019t the only defensive talent for Penn State. Rose and Gabriel have a combined 56 blocks on the year. Sean Harvey follows close behind with 17 blocks this season.</p>\n                <p>Harvey has been having a strong season so far, and poses a threat to any team that he faces.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt sophomore leads the team in points with 108.5. But where he really makes himself known is in kills. With 94 on the year, he leads by almost double that of any of his other teammates.</p>\n                <p>But, Saint Francis has Brady Stump, who currently has 87 kills on the season. It\u2019s also important to note that the Red Flash have played one less game than the Nittany Lions so far.</p>\n                <p>Stump also leads Saint Francis in service aces with 12, which matches Penn State\u2019s leader, Rose.</p>\n                <p>The 4-4 Nittany Lions have a chance to get back on a good note this weekend. If history repeats itself, the 4-3 Red Flash could be tacking a couple of losses to their record this weekend.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Jacob Godshall I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>On Oct. 28, 2025, a category five storm, Hurricane Melissa, hit the southern coast of Jamaica. The storm caused significant damage, and took a toll on the county\u2019s infrastructure, food production and housing.</p>\n                <p>It also took a toll on human-life, with at least 45 confirmed deaths caused by the storm, as of Dec. 2, 2025.</p>\n                <p>The storm was the largest to make landfall in Jamaica since Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and brought with it extreme rainfall and winds of up to 300 kilometers per hour. It hit Jamaica as a category five storm, before weakening and moving on to Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>\n                <p>Now, three months after the hurricane, restoration and aid efforts continue in Jamaica. Here, the Epsilon Gamma chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta (DST) sorority has teamed up with the Caribbean Student Association (CSA) to raise money for two families in affected areas. The goal is to raise around $2,000, according to CSA President Camren Boyogueno.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe idea is to give $1,000 to each family so that they would be able to take that and apply it to whatever they may need to, for help with restoration of either their homes or their resources,\u201d Boyogueno, a fourth-year studying neuropsychology, said.</p>\n                <p>The storm caused damage to homes and food supplies, as fishing was disrupted and agriculture was damaged, according to Boyogueno. The country\u2019s main airport in Montego Bay was also damaged, making transportation of both aid and people more difficult.</p>\n                <p>Boyogueno said the best way for the average student to help is to \u201cbe informed,\u201d and \u201cdonate if they feel inclined.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Antoinette Slaughter, a member of DST, said her family in Jamaica experienced the damages firsthand.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy family was directly affected regarding their housing, and there was damage in the house,\u201d Slaughter, a third-year studying nursing, said. \u201cObviously having your shelter damaged is extremely heartbreaking.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Slaughter said providing aid to some of these areas can be difficult, as many of them are rural, so \u201cto reach every single family is very difficult.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Chad-Daniel Salmon, an international student from Jamaica, also said the current infrastructure and geography of Jamaica can make aid difficult.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen you have especially extended rains, winds and stuff like that, and you're surrounded by roads, a lot of greenery, you might have a lot of trees blocking roads, you might have rivers overflowing into communities and you might have landslides where pieces of the road are just falling away,\u201d Salmon, a fifth-year studying mining engineering, said.</p>\n                <p>In addition to these short term impacts, other aspects of Jamaican life have been impacted, beyond just physical damage to roads and houses, according to Salmon. School disruptions are now a problem for many Jamaican students, as damage to their homes and schools has forced them to work to help repair.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEven though, yes, the island might technically be open for some people, their day-to-day is still not there,\u201d Salmon said.</p>\n                <p>Salmon said it\u2019s important to view hurricane effects in a different \u201cframing.\u201d While many organizations and aid-providers only consider short-term impacts like damage and loss of resources, he said it's important to also consider and take into account long-term issues.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think especially when it comes to news cycles, people love to show the videos of things like the roof missing, or the kid with no clothes or the kid who's looking at their home and it's not there anymore,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we also have to realize that these are people with whole lives and whole systems around them that they were using to survive, live and grow. In terms of when you cover storms, while it's important to look at the immediate damage, it's also important to think about how their life has been disrupted beyond just the damage that they are seeing in front of them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Trinity Benford, a member of DST, said it\u2019s important for organizations and people outside of Jamaica to be aware of what is happening, and willing to help.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like we hear a lot about things that happen and then we kind of forget about them, when in reality, people are living in these situations much longer than we hear about them,\u201d Benford, a third-year studying agriculture and biorenewable systems management, said. \u201cSo being able to gather non-profits that are actively working to help Jamaica, and being able to join efforts is something that we really wanted to help do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Those interested in contributing can do so <a href=\"https://psu.crowdchange.co/54326\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Annelise Hanson | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>\u201cYour worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing.\u201d Dostoevsky\u2019s words followed me through my head as I marveled at the marble and gold throughout the Vatican Museums on my way to the Sistine Chapel.</p>\n                <p>I carried the question with me, for how long have I, my generation and American society traded creativity, originality, wonder, depth and art, for noise, dopamine, immediacy and optimization?</p>\n                <p>The withering of self. We starve our artists and fund our corrupt corporations, rewarding nothing but the dull hum of endless scrolling. Aching for serenity that we sold for nothing. Betraying and destroying ourselves for our own atrophy and nothingness.</p>\n                <p>I tilted my head back and let my eyes rest on Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cCreation of Adam.\u201d Four years I thought, four years of devotion, discipline, of surrender to something greater than efficiency or profit, but for impact, legacy, and sheer awe. And now, centuries later, millions every year come to stand beneath his ceiling in silence, moved by his work.</p>\n                <p>I noticed the small distance between God\u2019s finger and Adam\u2019s, and remembered how I once filled sketchbooks of my recreation of this very movement. I tried to understand this space and how it separated man from divinity, and that maybe in that space there\u2019s a pause, and it\u2019s the very sin we have indulged that separates us. Rot. Decay. Superficiality.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps God and Adam never touch because sin is separation. And maybe this is ours, the slow betrayal of ourselves, the abandonment of what makes us alive, all for nothing at all.</p>\n                <p>Rome felt very intimate to me. I imagined Julius Caesar walking the same streets, and my time reciting monologues from Shakespeare\u2019s play. Maybe once his sandals struck the same stone. I thought of the Colosseum, and of the crowds who once gathered there, amused and ravenous for violence and the spectacle of humans being torn apart by wild animals.</p>\n                <p>I wonder when humanity decided suffering could become a form of leisure, and when gladiators were puppets, and death, a sport where lives were so easily disposable.</p>\n                <p>The only distance between ancient Romans and me was time. If we stood face to face, we would share no common language or meaning, just creatures from the same species.</p>\n                <p>And still this city gave us carbonara, amatriciana, and cacao e pepe. As much as Rome revealed to me, it reminded me I would miss this country, this version of myself and that I\u2019m already mourning the moments I\u2019m still inside of and grieving time that has not passed yet.</p>\n                <p>Back at Penn State, nearly every hour of my day is booked. I have always been fast-paced and busy by nature. In America, productivity is a virtue, and burnout serves as evidence. Here, I have no extracurriculars. No job.</p>\n                <p>Life here is slow, and what's the rush? I wake up earlier and rest. I can live with intention and explore my nature without expectations. I walk where I need to go without panicking about pace, and I possess more of the most valuable asset, which is time.</p>\n                <p>I stroll and hear music spill into the streets, opera singers, musicians playing cello. The beauty here is authentic; it doesn\u2019t run on a schedule or wait to be noticed, it just simply is.</p>\n                <p>I love it here, and I always knew I would.</p>\n                <p>Our real sin is that we\u2019re willing to forget what it feels like to be fully alive. To know tranquility, and choose speed anyway.</p>\n                <p>I am learning how rarely we allow ourselves this kind of presence. When I return, I hope I continue to channel the version of myself whose learning time isn\u2019t something to conquer, but something to live inside of.</p>\n                <p>MORE ABROAD COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After a historic weekend for hockey at Happy Valley, the focus is shifted back to closing out a successful season for No. 4 Penn State. The Nittany Lions closed out a series for the books with a 5-2 comeback win over Robert Morris, ultimately sweeping the Colonials.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white hit the road one last time this season as it travels to Maryland Heights, Missouri, for a series against Lindenwood. Game 1 of the series starts at 5 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n                <p>The two teams met earlier in the season, and Penn State swept the Lions, outscoring them 11-1.</p>\n                <p>Depth shines</p>\n                <p>Penn State played its first series without its three Olympians. Tessa Janecke, Matilde Fantin and Nicole Hall have landed in Milan, Italy, and will soon begin their games later this week. With one of the three forwards being first-line center Janecke, a hole in the first line had to be filled. Enter McKenna Walsh.</p>\n                <p>The Oswego, Illinois, native didn\u2019t wait long to prove she is capable of stepping in for Janecke\u2019s absence. Walsh scored the first-ever Penn State goal inside Beaver Stadium, then later followed it up with a goal in the second game of the series. Ultimately, the forward finished the weekend with two goals in two games.</p>\n                <p>Mya Vaslet made her name heard as she assisted on two goals in the second game, as well.</p>\n                <p>Scouting Lindenwood</p>\n                <p>Lindenwood has planted its foot on the gas for the last two weeks. The Lions have won five of their last six, ultimately acquiring sole possession of third place in the AHA. They are fresh off their second-straight series sweep at home.</p>\n                <p>When a team has produced the way the Lions have, several players make their presence felt. Three Lindenwood players earned AHA Women\u2019s Player of the Week awards this week. Forward Molly Henderson, defenseman Ellie Muscedere and goalie Lexington Secreto were honored by the conference for their performances last weekend.</p>\n                <p>A key contributor to Lindenwood\u2019s offense in its most recent series was Henderson. The forward finished the series with two goals and four assists, leading her team in points and goals on the season.</p>\n                <p>On the blue line, Muscedere took home her first award after recording four assists in Game 2. While in net, Secreto only allowed three goals throughout the series, finishing with a .948 save percentage.</p>\n                <p>All four lines seem to be on the same page for the Lions. Heading into its last home series of the season, Lindenwood seems to have the momentum a team needs heading into the end of the campaign, potentially posing a threat to the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Olympic recognition</p>\n                <p>Not only do the Nittany Lions have representatives in the Olympics, but Lindenwood also has a pair of defensemen representing its school as well. Both Lucie Quarto and Elina Zillox are in Milan, Italy, representing France in the games.</p>\n                <p>With players departing from both schools, several skaters who haven't seen much ice time all season have the opportunity to step up for their team.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Avery Hill | Football Editor",
    "description": "<p>Entering the four-month mark since James Franklin was fired from Penn State, much of what\u2019s discussed among the Penn State fanbase is a sense of anger, disappointment and resentment.</p>\n                <p>At a shallow level, I get it. Twenty-one losses against AP top-10 teams, one Big Ten championship, a three-game losing streak to conclude his tenure coaching one of the biggest brands in college football. But what\u2019s often ignored is what he did do.</p>\n                <p>Among other successes, Franklin 's tenure at Penn State made him a modern-day pioneer in an area he holds near and dear to his heart \u2014 being a Black coach. That should never be forgotten.</p>\n                <p>At Penn State, Franklin won 104 games, a tie with Rip Engle as the second-most in program history. He also won four New Year\u2019s Six bowls and brought Penn State to a preseason ranking it hadn\u2019t seen since the late 1990s, an accomplishment even if it all unraveled after three games.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Franklin is the winningest African American head coach in FBS history. He\u2019s also the first and only African-American head coach to win a Big Ten title among other notable achievements.</p>\n                <p>But these accolades, and other on-field statistics only scratch the surface on what Franklin has done as a Black head coach.</p>\n                <p>The Langhorne, Pennsylvania, native long made it a goal of his to become the first Black head coach to win a national title. Of course to be able to do that on an individual level is important to Franklin, but the impact it may have on other coaches cements his legacy even more.</p>\n                <p>At the 2025 Orange Bowl media day, he noted the marker of 16 of 134 FBS coaches being Black \u2014 a number that has shifted a bit with 136 teams and the firing of coaches like Sherrone Moore.</p>\n                <p>It was a relative increase from the 6 of 127 FBS coaches when Franklin was the offensive coordinator at Kansas State under fellow Black head coach Ron Prince.</p>\n                <p>But that increase starts with coaches giving qualified minorities a chance. Franklin did so when he hired Charles Huff, who was on Franklin\u2019s staff at Vanderbilt but never landed a major, full-time position coaching job until he became Penn State\u2019s running backs coach in 2014. Huff went on to take three head coaching jobs.</p>\n                <p>Even for Huff\u2019s current stop, Memphis, Senior Vice President and Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Ed Scott said Franklin, along with Nick Saban, gave a firm recommendation for Huff.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat truly sets him apart is his character and integrity,\u201d Franklin said according to Memphis.</p>\n                <p>Then there\u2019s Terry Smith, who left a 2-10 Temple team where he coached the wide receivers, and was hired by Franklin as cornerbacks coach.</p>\n                <p>He may have never, and may never, get a shot to be a full-time head coach, but his time as an interim and his role as associate head coach made him one of the more respected, and highest-paid, assistants in the business.</p>\n                <p>That in its own right is an accomplishment in Black coaching history as according to a 2023 article from the Journal of Intercollegiate Sport, \u201cBlack coaches were disproportionately responsible for signing higher rated recruits than their White counterparts.\u201d Said responsibility comes from what\u2019s usually a position coach, a typically underpaid role.</p>\n                <p>And also with a look through the Lasch Building, the diversity, from all shapes of life and all positions, was evident; Franklin\u2019s a man who wants to give a chance to the most qualified.</p>\n                <p>But, that didn\u2019t mean it was all perfect.</p>\n                <p>As the big personality in Franklin fought a passionate, but critical fanbase, many seasons didn\u2019t go by without a \u201cFire Franklin!\u201d chant of some sorts.</p>\n                <p>Even in what I\u2019d consider a mishandling of his responsibilities as head man, walking off of the podium when asked for comment on the accusations of rape committed by his former players Jameial Lyons and Kaveion Keys, Franklin had his fair share of incidents that hurt his resume and perception.</p>\n                <p>But, said turn in perception, regardless of severity of the incident, is a microcosm of the fight Black coaches have fought for a long time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of us having to be perfect to get the job,\u201d legendary Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson Jr. said in 1998.</p>\n                <p>Black coaches have often been far behind the ladder when it comes to making the big step.</p>\n                <p>For Franklin, that started as a non-Division l collegiate player, and included a player/coach job in Denmark that he told Inside the Lions\u2019 Audrey Snyder he laid asphalt during.</p>\n                <p>It took Franklin 16 years to earn the big shot, though it\u2019s worth noting the sort of systematic privilege as a former quarterbacks coach that was promoted to offensive coordinator got him the opportunity even fast. He also got an 11-plus-year leash \u2014 a dream for many others.</p>\n                <p>But it didn\u2019t change his end at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The boos, curses and toxicity made Franklin a subject of pure resentment from a fanbase that, despite his successes, are likely rooted in a feeling of him not doing enough and not appreciating enough.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s a setback in his journey that, coincidentally, came in an NFL season that saw Mike Tomlin be fired and no Black coach be hired.</p>\n                <p>But it\u2019s also a message that Franklin, and many others, aren\u2019t done fighting. As Franklin makes a home in Blacksburg, Virginia, he continues to push for a fair shot for all.</p>\n                <p>But he isn\u2019t, and can\u2019t, start from ground zero. Despite the darkness \u2014 some to his fault and some to others\u2019 \u2014 created during his end in Happy Valley, Franklin\u2019s tenure is a marker for true success for a Black coach at the collegiate level.</p>\n                <p>It shouldn\u2019t be overshadowed.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLACK HISTORY MONTH STORIES</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Savon Huggins completed Matt Campbell\u2019s first staff at Penn State when he was hired as running backs coach in January.</p>\n                <p>Huggins and Campbell said they both felt they were a match for each other. Campbell said he could tell the respect Huggins had while holding the role at Boston College.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSays a lot about his character, who he is, what he's about, and it shined through in the interview process,\u201d Campbell said at the National Signing Day press conference on Wednesday. \u201cWe felt like we had a grand slam in terms of getting Savon to come on board and his family. They fit us culturally, and I certainly believe they fit the Penn State way of doing things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Huggins, who joined the Eagles in 2022, helped the running game go from 63.4 yards per game in his initial campaign, to 199.5 in the next.</p>\n                <p>This past year, Huggins guided running back Turbo Richard to 749 yards and nine touchdowns on 145 carries. Huggins said he had opportunities to leave, but wanted to find the \u201cright people\u201d before making a jump to a new school.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt had to make sense,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cIt's a family decision for me. I got three children, so family is very important to me. I want to be in an environment where it makes sense for my children, the school they go to, and the leadership in terms of the head coach, in terms of the staff, the continuity. I mean, those guys have been together for a long time. That says a lot about coach Campbell.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Campbell joked that he asked Huggins, a 2011 247Sports composite 5-star running back, if he had any more eligibility left to play. Huggins played at Rutgers, rushing for 842 yards and nine touchdowns across 32 games before missing his senior year due to injury. He finished out his college days at Northern Iowa.</p>\n                <p>Campbell pointed to Huggins\u2019 collegiate career as one of the reasons why he\u2019s excited to have him on staff, saying Huggins coaches because of what he learned through his collegiate journey.</p>\n                <p>Furthermore, Huggins said he feels himself and Campbell view the recruiting process the same.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking for high character young men, not only from a player standpoint, but from a coaching standpoint,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cIf he wants to make sure that these young men are being led, he has to know that the coaches that are leading them are the right people.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Huggins brings recruiting ties to the New Jersey area with him as he was a graduate of St. Peter\u2019s Prep. He said he\u2019s a \u201crelationship person,\u201d and it stuck out to him that he was asked by Campbell about his family before any football-related topics during the interview process.</p>\n                <p>Campbell showing he also cares about building relationships made Huggins feel they were \u201caligned\u201d with what each of them were looking for during the hiring process.</p>\n                <p>\u201cObviously we talked ball and talked about holistically from a recruiting standpoint, all the other things,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cBut he really wanted to know the person, and for me, that's heartwarming in this profession to find a leader in that position.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State entered Wednesday\u2019s game against Purdue still searching for its first conference win of the season, but the Lady Lions got some star power back in their lineup after a week off. Junior Gracie Merkle returned to action after missing the last two games due to injury and made her presence known early.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions were resilient and fought hard for their first conference victory over Purdue in overtime 85-82.</p>\n                <p>The Mount Washington, Kentucky, native scored the first basket of the game off a missed jumper by Nyla McFadden. Penn State pressured Purdue early and forced a few turnovers and bad shots, but star guard Kiki Smith poured in some baskets and kept the Boilermakers close.</p>\n                <p>After a few minutes of no scoring by either team, star sophomore Kiyomi McMiller scored quickly off a short jumper and pulled the blue and white ahead 7-4. A few quick baskets by Purdue gave the Boilermakers the lead into the first timeout.</p>\n                <p>Purdue pressed the Lady Lions for the last four minutes of the first quarter and forced the blue and white into taking some uncomfortable shots. While the Lady Lions surrendered six turnovers in the opening frame, McMiller and Merkle combined for 15 of Penn State\u2019s 18 points and led Penn State into the second with an 18-15 lead.</p>\n                <p>Smith became hot again and poured in a quick five points in the first two minutes, which included a wide-open 3-pointer on the wing. The two squads exchanged buckets for a few minutes, but another lapse on defense left Purdue\u2019s Tara Daye wide open for a 3-pointer and the Boilermakers went ahead 26-24 at the 6:49 mark.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions took a 36-34 lead into halftime off an 11-4 run, led by six of McMiller\u2019s nine second-quarter points. Defensively, Purdue was kept on its feet after coach Carolyn Kieger switched looks between man and zone. The Boilermakers shot just 39% from the floor, including just 3-15 from behind the arc in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Merkle was the focal point in the blue and white\u2019s offense to start the second half, and she quickly drew the third foul on Purdue\u2019s Lana McCarthy. However, a few messy turnovers by Penn State allowed the Boilermakers to keep the score within a basket.</p>\n                <p>Kieger\u2019s squad forced a travel off a press at 4:42 in the third, but the Lady Lions immediately turned it over, and Daye made an easy layup down low. McMiller continued putting Penn State on her back and knocked down a five-foot jumper, and gave the blue and white its largest lead of the night at 46-41.</p>\n                <p>Purdue went on a quick 5-0 run to pull within one, but T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante found a wide-open Moriah Murray on the right wing for a 3-pointer to stop the bleeding. However, Penn State back-to-back steals by the Boilermakers on entrance passes to Merkle led to Kendall Puryear tying the game at 50 off a short jumper.</p>\n                <p>After a Merkle foul, Smith knocked down two free throws to give Purdue a 52-50 lead, roaring into the final frame. Turnovers haunted the Lady Lions in the third, as they surrendered a whopping seven giveaways compared to just one Purdue turnover.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State\u2019s two leading scorers held their own, the Lady Lions needed offense from another scorer to win their first conference game. Murray rose to the occasion and poured in two key 3-pointers for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>McMiller was contained in the second half by Purdue, but she drove downhill and flipped in a timely layup, giving Penn State a 64-59 lead with 4:25 left.</p>\n                <p>However, the blue and white stalled offensively, and the Boilermakers forced the Lady Lions\u2019 18th turnover of the contest. McCarthy\u2019s basket off the steal pulled Purdue back in front 65-64 at 2:43.</p>\n                <p>Just as she\u2019s done all season, McMiller was the offensive star down the stretch. She found Tea for a critical 3-pointer, then drove down on the next possession for another layup. McMiller\u2019s 10th basket gave Penn State a 71-67 lead with 55 seconds left.</p>\n                <p>Out of the Purdue timeout, Smith made just one of two free throws and then fouled McMiller on the other end. In the bonus, McMiller stepped up to the stripe with 27 seconds left with a chance of icing the first conference win for the Lady Lions. The Silver Spring, Maryland, native delivered two clutch free throws and gave Penn State a 73-68 lead.</p>\n                <p>Smith hit a timely 3-pointer out of the timeout, and McMiller was soon shooting free throws again with 15 seconds left. McMiller made the first, but missed the second, which set up a backbreaking 3-pointer by Nya Smith to tie the game at 74 with .4 seconds left.</p>\n                <p>After Merkle\u2019s miss from down low, Penn State entered overtime after some last-second heroics by Kiki and Nya. After a Purdue miss, McMiller drove and dished it out to the corner for a McFadden 3-pointer to put the Lady Lions up 77-74.</p>\n                <p>However, the Boilermakers punched right back after Murray committed a foul on Daye in the paint, who converted the and one to tie the game at 77 with 3:33 left.</p>\n                <p>After a stretch of minimal offense from both squads, fatigue set in; Penn State desperately needed a basket to break the tie. McMiller got doubled and tried forcing a pass to Merkle in the paint, but the ball was knocked away into the hands of Murray. Yet, Murray was wide open in the left corner, and she drained the 3-pointer, putting the Lady Lions up 81-78 with 36 seconds left.</p>\n                <p>McMiller made two clutch free throws with 24 seconds left to keep the lead 83-79, but Daye converted a critical and one to pull Purdue within one with 17 seconds. Viktoria Ranisavljevic converted two free throws and an empty Purdue possession on the other end gave Penn State its first conference win.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action against Michigan State at Rec Hall, Feb 7.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lexie Linderman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>D\u2019Anton Lynn had returned to the Lasch Building just once since he graduated from Penn State in 2012. As a defensive assistant for the Buffalo Bills, he came to Pro Day in 2015.</p>\n                <p>That stood until Matt Campbell came calling to offer Lynn the defensive coordinator position, a role he had just turned down the prior offseason. He took it, returning to Penn State facilities that look much different than they did 11 years ago.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like everything's a family decision at this point, and me and my wife just felt like we were more prepared this time around,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cAnd then the more I talked to coach Campbell on the phone, he really kind of reminded me of why I went to Penn State, just from what he was going to do with the culture here. So I was just excited to be on board.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lynn said it was still a difficult decision to pack everything up and move cross country, as his wife is from Los Angeles, where he and his family have spent the last three years. And he has three children under 3, complicating a big move even more.</p>\n                <p>Lynn also had a hard time leaving his players at USC that he\u2019s been with for the past two seasons, and Campbell said his defensive coordinator gave up some things \u201cfinancially\u201d to join his staff.</p>\n                <p>But the familiarity Lynn has with his new destination has helped mask some of that as guys like Director of Talent Acquisition Alan Zemaitis and Director of Player Development Jordan Hill have been around since Lynn\u2019s playing days.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust all the Penn State people that were here, like some people I played with, some people were on staff, but I just knew that I was familiar with the culture. I think that helped,\u201d Lynn said.</p>\n                <p>Lynn has received support from his former Penn State teammates as well since taking the job. He said he\u2019s been speaking with former roommate Matt McGloin the most, who lives \u201cright down the road\u201d and \u201cwill be out here a lot,\u201d according to Lynn.</p>\n                <p>The adjustment to actually coaching for the Nittany Lions, though, is still fresh for Lynn. He\u2019s been working on getting to know the staff and players but hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to do so with the coaches on the road recruiting the 2027 class.</p>\n                <p>Terry Smith has been a big help for Penn State\u2019s new defensive coordinator in that regard by telling him about players that don\u2019t have much on tape as Lynn works to nail down his scheme.</p>\n                <p>Smith and Lynn\u2019s previous relationship helped Campbell feel even better about the hire, and other trusted colleagues echoed positive sentiments about the former USC playcaller. His scheme and success as a defensive coordinator spoke for itself as well.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think the thing that I love about D\u2019Anton Lynn is his variability, his ability to have consistency,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd I think you see a confidence that his defense plays with. And you saw that at UCLA, you saw that at USC and the improvement that they were making during his time there. But you also saw the ability to structurally dictate and navigate the pace of the game at times.\u201d</p>\n                <p>What Lynn\u2019s not going to do, though, is bring his scheme from USC to Penn State and force the players into it. As work begins in a few weeks, Lynn will begin to implement his philosophy and make sure the on-field product is consistent each game come the end of August.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe want to really just build around what these guys do best,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cSo I try not to just be a system guy where, \u2018this is what we're going to do no matter what.\u2019 Let's really see what these guys do best. Let's build a scheme around that. And we just try to really emphasize it's more about how we play than as far as what we do. The scheme can change week to week, year to year, but as far as how we play, that has to be the same.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Penn State Notebook | Cael Sanderson reflects on match against Nebraska, evaluates pair of wrestlers",
    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After Penn State\u2019s 26-12 victory against Nebraska, the Nittany Lions will hit the road and travel to Ann Arbor to take on Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Before this matchup Cael Sanderson met with the media to discuss a handful of topics.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he had to say.</p>\n                <p>Recapping Nebraska</p>\n                <p>The match between Nebraska was interesting with two Penn Staters giving points to the other team. Nebraska didn\u2019t really attack and was on defense for most of the match. Penn State has been preparing for that for a while.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe\u2019re obviously preparing and stuff, it's not anything new,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cAnytime you have a good wrestler or you play a good team, people are going to try to figure out how to beat you and sometimes that\u2019s the best shot.\u201d</p>\n                <p>During the match, Braeden Davis and Levi Haines were two wrestlers that let their emotions get the best of them. Davis gave the Cornhuskers another point while Haines let Christopher Minto start with a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou want discipline, it\u2019s obviously a success principle, something that you got to have in all aspects of wrestling and your lifestyle,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWhen actions are not what we want them to be I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a good thing \u2026 anything that happens as a head coach, that\u2019s on me. We\u2019ll learn.</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze and Rocco Welsh</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze has gone underlooked, Sanderson said. He currently ranks at No. 4 at 133 pounds and has an undefeated 16-0 record. Blaze has multiple ranked wins and continues to look like a potential national championship contender.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s just a tremendous competitor. He stays in such good position as he\u2019s competing,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI think he\u2019s maybe a little under the radar if that\u2019s even possible because he\u2019s really really good. I mean I don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh had a slow start to the season, but has been on a roll after defeating the then-No. 1 wrestler in Angelo Ferrari from Iowa. In a tough 184 pound weight class, Welsh now finds himself at the top.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s a student of the game. He\u2019s a great competitor and I think he\u2019s getting more and more comfortable like he knows that this is where he belongs,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Hitting the road</p>\n                <p>Penn State hits the road to Ann Arbor to face the Wolverines. This will be a homecoming for two Nittany Lions as Braeden Davis and Josh Barr are Michigan natives, who will likely have their family and friends at the match.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson seemed excited to hit the road and likes how it could affect his team for the long run as the season continues.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think being on the road. It\u2019s almost easier because you\u2019re in a hotel, you\u2019re isolated. It\u2019s fun to go wrestling in other people\u2019s arenas,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe\u2019re just happy to compete.\u201d</p>",

    "title": "Olympic preview | Tessa Janecke, Team USA\u2019s path to the Gold Medal Game",
    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Eight years ago, Maddie Rooney made a stick save against Canada\u2019s Meghan Agosta in the sixth round of the shootout in the Gold Medal Game, giving the United States its first win in the event since 1998. In her fourth time representing her country at the Olympics, Hillary Knight finally earned a taste of gold.</p>\n                <p>In 2022, Team Canada played spoiler and prevented the United States from winning in back-to-back Olympic Games. Marie-Philip Poulin put the Canadians up 3-0 in the second period and never looked back.</p>\n                <p>Now, after over 1,400 days, Knight is back for the next time to represent the United States at the Olympics for the final time in her career. She\u2019ll travel to Italy with a few new teammates, one being Penn State\u2019s captain, Tessa Janecke.</p>\n                <p>Janecke looks to capture the third gold medal of her career, the first at the Olympic level. The Orangeville, Illinois, native previously won two gold medals at the IIHF World Championship, the second coming after her medal-clinching \u201cgolden goal.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Preliminary round</p>\n                <p>This year, the United States begins its chase for gold in Milano-Cortina in a group similar to the one it faced in 2022: Canada, Finland, Switzerland and now Czechia, who were placed in Group B at the Winter Games in Beijing.</p>\n                <p>During the last Winter Games, the Americans went 3-1 in the preliminary round with their lone loss coming from the Canadians.</p>\n                <p>This year, Janecke and Team USA will kick off this round of pool play on Thursday at 10:40 a.m. EST against Czechia. Competing in the event for the first time in history four years ago, the Czechs split their four games in the preliminary round before falling 4-1 to the United States in the quarterfinals after a three-goal period from the red, white and blue.</p>\n                <p>The next two games will come against Finland on Saturday and Switzerland on Monday. In 2022, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Alex Carpenter each scored twice in a 5-2 win over the Fins, and Alex Cavallini recorded a 12-save shutout in an 8-0 win over Switzerland.</p>\n                <p>The preliminary round concludes on Feb. 10, a date Americans and Canadians have circled on their calendars, when the two play each other.</p>\n                <p>Team USA hasn\u2019t beaten Team Canada in a preliminary round in any of the last three Winter Games. Going back to the 2014 Games in Sochi, the United States is 1-5 against its neighbors from the north, its lone win coming in the 2018 Gold Medal Game.</p>\n                <p>Quarterfinal round</p>\n                <p>From this round forward, everything is left up to seeding. Team USA has an advantage being in Group A, a group containing teams that are referred to as the top in the world. In 2022, they finished second in the group behind Canada with nine points, but would have advanced regardless.</p>\n                <p>Looking at Group B, Sweden is projected to be one of the top finishers, earning it the sixth seed.</p>\n                <p>Assuming the United States falls to Team Canada again in pool play, they would finish as the No. 2 seed and would play the No. 7 seed. That seed could be filled by Japan, who appropriately enough are ranked seventh in the IIHF rankings.</p>\n                <p>Should the host Italy pull off some upsets in the preliminary round, it could also sneak into the No. 7 seed. That would set up a game for Penn State fans to watch as the Nittany Lions' captain Janecke would face teammate Matilde Fantin.</p>\n                <p>Semifinal round</p>\n                <p>The United States has reached the semifinal round in every Olympic appearance. All but once have the Americans advanced to the Gold Medal Game. Their lone loss in this round was in 2006, when Sweden won in a shootout, shocking the nation.</p>\n                <p>In each of the last two Winter Olympics, the United States has faced Finland in the semifinals. Rooney recorded a 14-save shutout in a 5-0 win in 2018, and Knight recorded two points in a 4-1 win in 2022.</p>\n                <p>Gold Medal Game</p>\n                <p>Despite the six games needed to play to reach this point, it\u2019s one that most think the Americans won\u2019t have an issue facing. Besides the off-year that was 2006, the United States has reached the Gold Medal Game at each Winter Olympics, including 1998 when it captured the gold in the first year women\u2019s hockey became an event.</p>\n                <p>Its foe in all of those games has also been the same: Team Canada. As expected, the Canadians have a stacked roster that features Poulin, Brianna Jenner and Julia Gosling \u2014 who each rank top-10 in points in the PWHL \u2014 and Jocelyne Larocque, who has captured two Olympic gold medals already.</p>\n                <p>If the United States can pull off the upset just as it did in 2022, it would give Janecke her first Olympic gold medal and make her the first player in program history to win a spot on the highest stand of the podium.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",
