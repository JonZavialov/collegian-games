    "description": "<p>A beloved preparatory ritual signifying unity and controlled transgression, tailgating is so much more than a bunch of silly geese drinking their little faces off.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s nothing more American than college football. And there\u2019s definitely nothing more American than a Ford F-150, burgers and dogs and an ice-cold beer on top of college football.</p>\n                <p>Tailgating is an essential part of game day. We wake up early, dress in our finest blue and white, and break all social barriers.</p>\n                <p>The usual group dynamics are totally shaken up \u2014 parents, students and alumni alike party together and celebrate their shared heritage (if you will) of Penn State ball. We come together, not as different sects of the social strata, but as a singular group with a shared interest.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s a lax way to socialize with both peers and adults, as you\u2019ll inevitably end up with someone\u2019s mother and father, their siblings and maybe even their grandparents. It\u2019s an easy way to flex those social muscles in a setting that eliminates all awkwardness by breaching the normal rules of traditional etiquette.</p>\n                <p>As a Southerner, meeting an adult, I will still say \u201cyes ma\u2019am\u201d or \u201cno sir,\u201d but the hesitancy of chatting with people typically above your social paygrade all but evaporates.</p>\n                <p>And so many people have this \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d attitude. Strike up a conversation with the tailgate next to yours, and you\u2019ll be partying with people you met five seconds ago before you know it.</p>\n                <p>Compare this with the usual attitude of more formal invitations and the Gen Z inability to even smile at your neighbors in the hallways.</p>\n                <p>And we transgress other norms as well. My freshman year, before we sold alcoholic beverages at Beaver Stadium, all of Penn State was a dry campus.</p>\n                <p>That is, except for game days. It was this unspoken rule that you better not be caught dead with liquor in 16802 \u2014 unless it was a fall Saturday, of course.</p>\n                <p>I used to love seeing 18-year-olds traipsing along Millennium Science Complex with a couple of twelve packs in their hands and the police just a hundred yards or so off pretending not to notice.</p>\n                <p>And music is played so loudly, you\u2019d think your eardrums would burst and the police\u2019d come knocking down your door for a noise complaint, but it\u2019s par for the course in the fields above the stadium.</p>\n                <p>America prizes the individual, rightly so, but gamedays let us put our group above ourselves, if just for a couple of fun-filled hours. Tailgating and rooting for a team allow us to prioritize something besides our own little worlds for a change.</p>\n                <p>How nice it is to forget ourselves for a moment to watch Nick Singleton absolutely dominate with 107,000 of your closest friends.</p>\n                <p>People are able to forget about themselves and what they look like and who they\u2019re with for the duration of the day. They\u2019re able to loosen the death grip social media typically has on young people\u2019s everyday lives and live in the moment while they finally touch some grass.</p>\n                <p>And there\u2019s so much symbology. Flags fly everywhere from the stars and bars to the Nittany Lion, from fraternity letters to Nicki Minaj. Next time you find yourself at a tailgate, stop for just a moment and appreciate the camaraderie that college has afforded us.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "title": "Olympic preview | Nicole Hall, Jessica Adolfsson, Team Sweden\u2019s path to the gold medal game",
    "author": "Sami Altmire | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s an Olympic year. Like every other country headed to the Milan Cortina Olympic Games, Team Sweden, with current Nittany Lion, Nicole Hall and former Penn Stater Jessica Adolfsson have a chance to take home the gold.</p>\n                <p>Taking home an Olympic gold medal is one of the oldest sporting honors, but getting there is an accomplishment of its own. Sweden is a powerhouse in the hockey world, and the women's team, commonly known in Sweden as the \u201cDamkronorna\u201d or \u201cThe Lady Crowns,\u201d always held its own. Team Sweden has two medals under its belt; here are the steps it needs to take to secure gold number three.</p>\n                <p>Step One: Preliminary Rounds</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden will face Germany on Feb. 5, Italy on Feb. 7, France on Feb. 8 and Japan on Feb. 10. Depending on the results of those games, Team Sweden will advance to playoff matches in hopes of reaching the gold medal match.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden is looking at redemption this year after a less-than-ideal finish at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, finishing eighth, which is its lowest to date. Historically, it has had a pretty decent run at the Olympics, being a powerhouse among the other teams, so a comeback could very much be in their cards.</p>\n                <p>Looking at the teams it will face, Team Germany and France are returning to the Olympic Games after some time away. Team Germany could struggle against Sweden, as this is its first Olympic appearance since 2014. Team France is making its Olympic debut this year, so taking on an established team like Sweden could be a challenge. Team Italy, featuring Nittany Lion Matilde Fantin, is returning to the games after 20 years. The most accomplished opponent Team Sweden faces in the group stages is Team Japan, which finished ahead of the Swedes at the 2022 Beijing Olympics in fifth place, so that matchup will be one to watch.</p>\n                <p>Step 2: Quarter Finals</p>\n                <p>As of now, there is no guarantee of what the four quarterfinal games will look like, but the pool of teams to choose from is strong. There are powerhouses: Team USA, Team Canada, Team Switzerland and Team Finland, against whom the remaining teams, such as Team Sweden, will have to compete.</p>\n                <p>These matchups will be quality, with every team bringing in new talent and new ideas. Team Sweden, which features young collegiate talent, may consider a new approach in these tournament stage rounds.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden went down in the quarter finals at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, taking a brutal loss from Team Canada, 11-0. Faceoffs were a major struggle for the Swedes, who lost the majority. Confidence can carry them through the group stages and may be the reason they reach the semi-finals.</p>\n                <p>Step 3: Semi-Finals</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden has had major success in the semi-finals; the most memorable is the major upset against Team USA at the 2006 Turin Olympics, in which the team beat the Americans in a shoot out.</p>\n                <p>Team Sweden won one of their two medals at the Turin Olympics, securing silver and leaving the Americans with bronze. Reaching medal contention will be a journey, especially for a team focused on rebuilding as much as Team Sweden.</p>\n                <p>Step 4: Finals</p>\n                <p>Reaching medal contention will likely mean getting past Team Switzerland or Team Finland and, most likely, facing Team USA or Canada. The Swedish have the history, the talent and the fire. The Nittany Lions already have multiple Olympians and Olympic medalists, and Team Sweden has the potential to increase that number.</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "\u2018This is real\u2019 | Penn State alum Dan Barefoot set to represent Team USA in skeleton",
    "author": "Elliott Inscho | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will be represented by several athletes in this month\u2019s Olympic Winter Games, but few of them have a story quite as interesting as Dan Barefoot, who will be competing in skeleton, a winter sledding sport, for Team USA.</p>\n                <p>Barefoot grew up in nearby Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and attended Richland High School.</p>\n                <p>He graduated from the university in 2013 with a degree in landscape architecture. The rigor of his academics was a key force in his desire to pursue athletics after graduation.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI probably spent like six hours a day just working in the studio in the architecture school,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cThere was never a moment in my day where I wasn\u2019t doing something, and I think I got used to that. I liked staying busy, and I think that was the reason I attempted to look up the sport.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s hard enough to become an Olympic athlete, let alone in a sport that most Americans haven\u2019t even heard of. The 35-year-old credits his discovery of the unique event to a simple internet search.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI literally just started Googling things,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I came across the sport. Alphabetically, bobsled and skeleton were near the top, and it was one of the first things I clicked on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While he came across the sport in an instant, the journey to its highest level hasn\u2019t been equally as quick for Barefoot. He\u2019s been competing for nearly a decade, this year marking his ninth year involved with the sport, and it\u2019s been a grind to get to where he is.</p>\n                <p>Like many sports, there are several levels of competition that an athlete has to work up in order to reach the peak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe system is set up kind of like Major League Baseball,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cThe World Cup is the MLB, and there\u2019s all these layers under it. You try your best in the lower levels, and once in a while, you get a podium spot. Then the federation moves you up to the next level, and you suck again, but eventually you get another podium spot and they move you up again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Barefoot spent those years working his way up the ranks until he made his first World Cup team about three and a half years ago. As the highest level of skeleton, outside of the Olympics, it was the toughest test yet for the 5-foot-10 athlete.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dogfight up there,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cI was getting my a\u2014 kicked in a couple races, but I also had a couple races that were good. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a total points thing, so you can have a couple bad races, but if you have a couple good races, you get points for those.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With skeleton being such a niche sport, at least on the national stage, Barefoot works as a landscape architect in addition to competing. Balancing work, training and competing became difficult as he began taking it more seriously.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the beginning, I was a landscape architect, and this was a thing that I was trying,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cThat thing that I was trying became more serious, and over time, I was putting more and more effort into the sport and working less and less.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, Barefoot and his superiors decided to transfer him to a part-time employee, so he could continue to pursue skeleton, and that change has worked well for both parties, so far. These games will be Barefoot\u2019s first, and surprisingly, he initially wasn\u2019t as excited to qualify as many would expect.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI had no emotions,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cYou get so focused along the way on the small goals, like if you were driving and looking right in front of your headlights instead of down the road, and that\u2019s the way you make progress. But then, all of a sudden, you get to your destination and you\u2019re like \u2018holy s\u2014.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>He ended up feeling the expected emotion when he told the people who helped him get there.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t until I was texting my mom and responding to Instagram messages from friends that I had before I started the sport, guys whose couch I was sitting on, saying \u2018I\u2019m trying out for this sport,\u2019 and they would say \u2018keep at it, let\u2019s see what happens.\u2019 When I was messaging those guys back, all of a sudden tears started coming to my eyes, and I was like, \u2018holy s\u2014, this is real.\u2019 Because it\u2019s not just a journey for me. So many people have been involved.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Skeleton is unique because of the high speeds and relatively little control the athletes have. Those factors give beginners huge adrenaline rushes, but Barefoot has grown to find peace in the uncontrollable.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOnce you fully commit to something that you know you can't back out from, metaphorically or literally, your body becomes so calm,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cIt locks in. All the noise that would be floating around in your head goes away.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite Barefoot finding it peaceful, skeleton is undoubtedly dangerous. He had a recent run-in with a track worker that will sideline him for his first opportunity to get on the ice in Italy, but it shouldn\u2019t have an effect in competition.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis guy was watching the camera feed,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cExpecting to see when I would start sliding, but it stopped working, and he never saw that happen. As soon as I came out of a corner, and looked up to look at the next one, I saw two legs and a shovel.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The impact caused a tear in his deltoid, which isn\u2019t ideal as he enters the games, but is far better than a joint or bone injury. Those injuries could have prevented an opportunity that Barefoot and those around him had been working towards for years.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy support team, I feel like, was more important than me,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cIn this journey, I feel like I contributed like a third of it, and the other two-thirds is everybody supporting, sharing stories and donating. Without those pieces, I\u2019m not here. I\u2019m looking forward to representing them, feeling excited, and feeling grateful to potentially do a once-in-a-lifetime thing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s been a journey to get to the games for Barefoot, and he\u2019ll finally get a chance to race on the sport\u2019s biggest stage on Feb.12 and 13. Even though the pressure is on, he\u2019s staying grounded as the days approach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThinking about getting a medal at the Olympics doesn\u2019t get you a medal at the Olympics,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cWhat gets you a medal is thinking about the form, the breathing, the small stuff. My goal is to keep it simple, to really relax, enjoy the moment, trust everything that I\u2019ve put in so far, and really lean on that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE OLYMPICS CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Like any young adult in college, I've been trying to convince myself for years that I won\u2019t get homesick. For me, living in Maryland and going to Penn State, only three hours away, I never really had to worry about it too much. All it takes is a phone call from my parents and they'll come get me or I\u2019ll make the drive home.</p>\n                <p>Now, my home for the next four months is in Barcelona, Spain, 4,000 miles away instead of just under 200 miles. I\u2019ve switched from English to Spanish, use the Barcelona Metro instead of the \u201cWHOOP,\u201d and traded sweat pants for jeans from Zara.</p>\n                <p>When I first got here, I thought to myself, \u201cI\u2019ll be so busy, I won\u2019t even have time to get homesick.\u201d And I was right, at the beginning.</p>\n                <p>My second weekend here, I hopped on a plane to the Scottish Highlands. I spent two days off the coast of Spain, only an hour from Barcelona. My week was booked and busy with clubs, cafes, and repeat. I didn\u2019t have time to get homesick. Then, I had my weekly FaceTime with my family and my mom was cruel enough to ask if I missed her.</p>\n                <p>Once she asked that single question I would get lost in my thoughts to and from class.</p>\n                <p>I would get quiet at night, knowing their sun was still shining while I was stuck with the moon. I missed them terribly.</p>\n                <p>Knowing myself, however, I knew I would drive myself crazy if I kept myself in that homesick funk, so I turned to my constants. Fast food and TV dramas.</p>\n                <p>While I grieve the absence of Chipotle and Chick-fil-a, and I can no longer hop into my car and drive through Happy Valley, I found other avenues. I turned away from the one euro tacos for a meal at KFC and McDonald's.</p>\n                <p>I finally figured out how to change the Spanish audio to English on my TV in my apartment and scrolled for hours on Hulu, watching episode after episode of cringey American shows.</p>\n                <p>When I caught a cold, I sacrificed a class absence to journey to the 24-hour markets and scour for a pack of Oreo\u2019s and Diet Coke (or Coca-Cola Zero as they say here) and watched movies snuggled up in my bed, imagining I was back at home or in my apartment in State College.</p>\n                <p>I did anything that reminded me of being in Maryland or Penn State, keeping myself tethered to my old self while I became a new person at the same time. I worked around the time differences and reached out to my roommates back home and other friends abroad, keeping my relationships alive and constant.</p>\n                <p>I reminded myself that my life would still be there when I returned, and I reminded myself that being abroad was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>\n                <p>Almost a month now, I have special routines. I allow myself to eat fast food once or twice a week. I\u2019ll have a Pink Drink from Starbucks instead of a caf\u00e9 con leche.</p>\n                <p>While there\u2019s so much to be seen in Barcelona, and so many new things to throw and immerse myself into, it\u2019s important to have a balance. Give yourself some time to FaceTime your parents, or watch a Netflix movie with your roommates abroad, just to get a little taste of what\u2019s waiting for you back at home.</p>\n                <p>MORE ABROAD COLUMNS</p>",

    "title": "5 ways to create the perfect Galentine's Day party",
    "author": "Ava Krysko | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Not to be clich\u00e9, but most people know love comes in many forms, and doesn't always necessarily mean the relationship between a couple. Many out there may scramble to get reservations at a favorite restaurant and buy a perfect Valentine's Day gift \u2014 some may even stress about getting a date \u2014 but Feb. 14 doesn't have to be that way.</p>\n                <p>You can always celebrate the day with friends, who, let's be honest, may be the group of people you love the most. After all, why limit a fabulous holiday filled with candy, affection and hearts to romantic relationships?</p>\n                <p>Galentine's Day is meant to show love to the gal pals and bros in your life. There are so many ways to have a fun Galentine's Day party, and here are five to ensure a great time with your besties.</p>\n                <p>1) Decorate</p>\n                <p>Any proper party thrower knows that decorations are what set the mood for a get together. Boring decorations equal a boring party. Although Valentine's Day decor might not be as easy to find as other major holidays such as Christmas and Halloween, there's still plenty to choose from at stores such as Target and Michaels.</p>\n                <p>If you're on a budget for Galentine's, there's no need to worry, decorating doesn't have to be expensive. With plenty of homemade options that look just as cute, the sky's the limit.</p>\n                <p>For example, heart garlands made of red and pink construction paper or felt are perfect for stunning guests. Another option is painting wine glasses with cute Valentine's designs. Not only does this make for an adorable decoration, but also it provides drinkware.</p>\n                <p>If you doubt your crafting abilities, or simply don't want to take on crafting by yourself, you can always rope in your friends to craft decorations at the party, adding an activity. This can be especially fitting if you're celebrating Galentine's with your roommates.</p>\n                <p>2) Provide food and drinks</p>\n                <p>Possibly the best part of any party is the food. Pizza and hoagies are a classic you may want to serve, or you can go for something a bit more niche like your favorite restaurant or something you've never tried before.</p>\n                <p>Candy salads or charcuterie boards make for perfect appetizers and are aesthetically pleasing as well.</p>\n                <p>When it comes to drinks for Galentine's Day, any pink or red punch or mocktail will do the trick. You can consider making strawberry daiquiris or alcoholic shirley temples for those over 21, and edible glitter can be added to any of these options to make them shine even more.</p>\n                <p>3) Bake a sweet treat</p>\n                <p>If there's any day that's meant for a sweet treat, it's Galentine's Day. There's endless options for dessert, but anything strawberry or cherry-flavored fits the theme the best. This can include strawberry shortcake, cherry tarts or even chocolate-covered strawberries.</p>\n                <p>Baking is especially perfect for Galentine's because it's a practice that uses time and love. Whether you're doing it before the party, or creating a delicacy with your friends, baking takes a lot of heart.</p>\n                <p>4) Watch a rom-com</p>\n                <p>Although it can sometimes take suspension of reality to get into a rom-com (what are the odds you bump into a stranger that just happens to be your perfect match?) when it comes to Galentine's, rom-coms are a perfect way to spend the day.</p>\n                <p>Curling up on the couch with your best friends to gush over a sweet romance can't be beat. Moreover, rom-coms have a certain light-hearted tone that's the best for a day like Galentine's.</p>\n                <p>If rom-coms really aren't your thing, any type of movie can theoretically work. Even horror/slasher movies could possibly be romantic. After all, nothing quite says \"I love you\" like the terror of a serial killer.</p>\n                <p>5) Play a game</p>\n                <p>To ensure that your partygoers don't get bored, adding a game to the festivities never hurts. This can include things such as Valentine's-themed bingo or trivia.</p>\n                <p>Another idea is to have each member of your party create different slideshows to present about various topics. The subjects don't have to be boring \u2014 curating the perfect skincare routine or ex-partner horror stories can make for an interesting presentation.</p>\n                <p>Although this may fall a bit into the baking category, creating a \"Hear Me Out Cake\" may provide some entertainment as well. To do this, you'll need a cake, along with pictures of some unconventional people (or characters, there's no judgment here) you find attractive. Each person takes turns revealing their choices and sticking them onto the cake.</p>\n                <p>Hopefully, these tips will help you create a fun, festive Galentine's Day party with love all around.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "8 must-reads for Black History Month",
    "author": "Ava Krysko | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Although it\u2019s often overlooked, reading is one of the best ways to gain information, especially when learning about a different culture. When it comes to Black History Month, picking up a book can help you become a more informed and aware individual.</p>\n                <p>Whether you decide to pick up a historical fiction novel or an autobiography, reading can help you to explore things you never knew before. To get a better understanding about which books might be helpful, Penn State professors shared eight book recommendations for Black History Month.</p>\n                <p>1) \"The African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality\" by Cheikh Anta Diop</p>\n                <p>First published in 1974, this book presents historical and archaeological information to assert ancient Egyptian civilization was founded by Africans. Although white Egyptologists tried to debunk his theory, Diop argued fiercely that it was correct.</p>\n                <p>This book was recommended by Michael West, professor of African American studies, history and African studies, because he said it is \"foundational for understanding global African history.\"</p>\n                <p>2) \"Black Reconstruction\" by W.E.B. Du Bois</p>\n                <p>Written by renowned author, W.E.B. Du Bois, \"Black Reconstruction\" tells the story of African Americans during the Reconstruction Era. It explores the ways in which Black Americans reshaped democracy and reconstructed America post-Civil War.</p>\n                <p>Also recommended by West, he said it's an important read because of \"its exposition of the Black agency in the single most important event in U.S. experience.\"</p>\n                <p>3) \"The Black Book\" edited and compiled by Toni Morrison</p>\n                <p>\"The Black Book,\" published in 1974, reads like an anthology. It contains stories and historical documents of African Americans from the beginning of slavery to the mid-20th century in America.</p>\n                <p>According to Professor Carmin Wong, a graduate research assistant who recommended the book, \"The Black Book\u201d serves as a visual and documentary archive of Black history in the United States, as it uses photographs, ephemera and historical records to center Black life and cultural memory.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Wong said Morrison makes Black history accessible for wider audiences.</p>\n                <p>\"Morrison was acutely aware of readership, who these stories are written for, who has access to them and who has been excluded,\" Wong said. \u201c\u2018The Black Book\u2019 reflects this awareness with compilations of historical records in a way that invites engagement from readers who may not otherwise encounter Black history in institutional archives or academic texts.\"</p>\n                <p>4) \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\" by Walter Rodney</p>\n                <p>This book takes a look at how Europe exploited Africa's resources for themselves and created overwhelming issues when it comes to the continent\u2019s progress in politics, society and the economy.</p>\n                <p>Wong also recommended this book and described it as, \"a critical examination of colonialism and its long-term economic and social effects on the African continent and African diasporic peoples.\"</p>\n                <p>\u201cRodney argues that the exploitation of Africa led to the underdevelopment and restructuring of pre-colonial African societies, directly challenging narratives that frame colonial rule as beneficial,\u201d Wong said.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Wong described how the book takes a look at how colonialism reshaped racial identities of African people and how it left a lasting legacy of global inequality through structured systems of race, power and capitalism.</p>\n                <p>\"I selected this text because I want to be mindful that we need to turn to Black writers across the globe in discourse on Black history, and Rodney's work provides an essential transnational framework that situates African histories and diasporic experiences as central rather than peripheral to these conversations,\" Wong said.</p>\n                <p>Wong said while this book is a good starting place to learn more about these ideas and understand the function of class in oppressive systems, it should still be followed up by other texts for further education.</p>\n                <p>5) \"The Third Reconstruction: America's Struggle for Racial Justice in the 21st Century\" by Peniel E. Joseph</p>\n                <p>\"The Third Reconstruction,\" published in 2022, explores the idea that the racial reckoning of 2020 was the climax of the third Reconstruction period in America.</p>\n                <p>Darryl Thomas, professor of African American studies, recommended this book and said it compares the first two Reconstruction periods \u2014 along with the backlash that followed them \u2014 and how Black freedom was fostered through the end of current racial regimes.</p>\n                <p>\"Joseph brings attention to the current backlash to the election of Barack Obama as a backlash against diversity, equity and Black freedom,\" Thomas said.</p>\n                <p>6) \"Making All Black Lives Matter: Reimagining Freedom in the 21st Century\" by Barbara Ransby</p>\n                <p>Another book recommended by Thomas, \"Making All Black Lives Matter\" focuses on the role of Black feminists in Black liberation movements.</p>\n                <p>\"She (Ransby) pays special attention to the radical Black feminist and others outside of the American establishment who not only challenge mass incarceration but the marginalization of those outside of the mainstream,\" Thomas said. \"She declares that freedom and democracy are a lifestyle as well as human rights for all.\"</p>\n                <p>7) \"Stamped from the Beginning\" by Ibram X. Kendi</p>\n                <p>Published in 2016, \"Stamped from the Beginning\" centers on the history of racist ideas and how they infiltrated American society.</p>\n                <p>Professor and Co-Director of the Center for Black Digital Research Christopher Dancy recommended this book and said it \"details a useful history as one considers anti-Blackness in the context of U.S. history and present.\"</p>\n                <p>8) \"Freedom Dreams\" by Robin D.G. Kelley</p>\n                <p>\"Freedom Dreams\" chronicles a history of radical Black activism in the United States.</p>\n                <p>Dancy also recommended this book, and suggests everyone read the most recent edition which includes Kelley's reflections in modern times.</p>\n                <p>\"It's a great book for contextualizing Black experiences within histories of the Black radical tradition,\" Dancy said.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

The Huskies took the game to overtime and Maryland ultimately gave up 24 points in a double-overtime window despite Yarden Garzon\u2019s 24 points.</p>\n                <p>On Saturday, Maryland allowed 24 points in the fourth quarter to Oregon to lose its fourth-straight game and fall to 5-6 in conference play.</p>\n                <p>Indiana earns 1st conference win</p>\n                <p>While Garzon\u2019s team hit the losing column again last week, her former team found its first win since Dec. 21.</p>\n                <p>The Hoosiers came out victorious against Northwestern on Sunday, winning 89-75 for their first conference win of the year.</p>\n                <p>Former Penn State senior Shay Ciezki continued to make her case as a future WNBA player, recording 33 points for her sixth 30-point game of the year.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern had two conference wins against Rutgers and Wisconsin heading into Sunday\u2019s game, but fell to the 15th seed in the tournament, teetering on the brink of elimination.</p>\n                <p>USC, Illinois earn much-needed upsets</p>\n                <p>After only winning one game in the first three weeks of January, USC ended the month with a big win over then-No. 8 Iowa.</p>\n                <p>The Hawkeyes had an eight-game winning streak entering Thursday\u2019s contest, but 20-plus point games by Jazzy Davidson and Kara Dunn gave the Trojans the 12-point victory.</p>\n                <p>Illinois earned an upset of its own, taking down the No. 25 Huskies at home.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Illini also had a pair of 20-plus point scorers in Cearah Parchment and Berry Wallace, with Parchment recording a 23-point, 10-rebound double-double.</p>\n                <p>Battle of Michigan in OT</p>\n                <p>One of the closest games of the week came in a battle of Michigan as the Wolverines traveled to East Lansing to face Michigan State on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>It was a close contest between the two teams, as the Wolverines entered the half leading by one point.Both teams were in the top-25 entering the night, but it was No. 9 Michigan who came away victorious.</p>\n                <p>The Wolverines were led by Mila Holloway and Olivia Olson, who combined for 49 points on the day.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>While Penn State was taking down Nebraska in the Bryce Jordan Center, other conference competition occurred with some major headlines.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State maintained their undefeated season, setting up a likely unbeaten vs. unbeaten in the Bryce Jordan Center on Feb. 13. A major home upset took place in Minnesota while another conference foe earned its first win.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State stays undefeated</p>\n                <p>Ohio State defeated No. 17 Wisconsin and No. 10 Michigan in a two-dual weekend. The Buckeyes won 30-10 and 26-16, respectively, moving to 16-0 on the season.</p>\n                <p>The Buckeyes were trailing the Badgers 10-9 at the intermission, causing some major questions, but that was without their top 125-pound wrestler.</p>\n                <p>Nic Bouzakis has been alternating starts if Ohio State wrestles twice in a weekend, causing him to not wrestle against the Badgers. Wisconsin\u2019s Nicolar Rivera won the match at 125 pounds after Vinceng Kilkeary filled in for Bouzakis.</p>\n                <p>The other headliner was the final bout between Michigan and Ohio State. No. 7 Taye Ghadiali of Michigan and No. 3 Nick Feldman went to sudden victory, where Ghadiali took down Feldman to get the upset victory. It didn\u2019t matter for the dual, but with the postseason around the corner, Ghadiali could improve his seeding in the Big Ten and NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota upsets Iowa</p>\n                <p>No. 9 Minnesota went into Carver-Hawkeye Arena and took down No. 4 Iowa in a close battle. The Golden Gophers defeated the Hawkeyes, 21-16, on the road behind some headlining victories.</p>\n                <p>Max McEnelly didn\u2019t have to face Angelo Ferrari, but was still tested at 184 pounds. Gabe Arnold stepped in and performed well, not allowing a takedown through seven minutes of action. With eight seconds remaining in sudden victory, McEnelly took down Arnold to get the victory, 4-1.</p>\n                <p>With Ferrari\u2019s status still unknown, Arnold appears to be a proven wrestler who can compete with the top, but it was McEnelly who was the better wrestler, expanding the lead to 15-13.</p>\n                <p>At 157 pounds, Minnesota\u2019s Charlie Millard, ranked No. 21, defeated No. 12 Jordan Williams by major decision. Williams was the favorite entering the match, but Millard put that to rest quickly, defeating Williams 13-3.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State earns first conference win</p>\n                <p>Two of the bottom teams in the conference, Michigan State and Northwestern, battled it out in East Lansing, Michigan. The Spartans earned their first win of the season, defeating the Wildcats, 22-20.</p>\n                <p>It was a late push from Northwestern, as the dual began at 197 pounds. With Michigan State holding a 22-9 lead after the 157-pound weight class, the Wildcats picked things up.</p>\n                <p>They needed at least a tech fall and two-major decisions, to get to the 22-point mark. Eddie Enright did his job at 174 pounds for Northwestern, winning by major decision, but the 165 pound and 184-pound class ended in decisions, giving Michigan State its first Big Ten dual win of the season.</p>\n                <p>Massoma Endene</p>\n                <p>Massoma Endene has been in the headlines for weeks. After being dismissed by Iowa in early January, it\u2019s reported by Justin Basch that Endene will enter the transfer portal and file for a medical redshirt.</p>\n                <p>With not wrestling since November, Endene\u2019s redshirt will likely go through giving him the chance to compete at the Division I level once again.

The Boilermakers ultimately finished the first half up 11 points and held that lead the rest of the game.</p>\n                <p>Purdue was led by Rashunda Jones and Sophie Swanson, who combined for 61 points. However, Jones left for Michigan State and Swanson for Virginia Tech during the offseason, so Purdue has been left to find a new leading scorer.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions were also led by Gabby Elliott and Grace Hall, who now play for Arizona State and SMU. The duo scored 32 points and 16 points, respectively.</p>\n                <p>Current redshirt junior Gracie Merkle also scored double-digits against Purdue, recording 10 points, six rebounds and two blocks.</p>\n                <p>Scouting Purdue</p>\n                <p>Despite a rough start to the season with a loss to satellite campus Purdue Fort Wayne, the Boilermakers have since recovered and are tentatively in the Big Ten Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Purdue earned three conference wins in January, beginning with an eight-point victory over Wisconsin. That win then fueled the Boilermakers to an overtime upset of then-No. 23 Washington.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions have since lost to both teams, falling to the Huskies by 16 points on their West Coast trip.</p>\n                <p>This year\u2019s Purdue squad is a lower-scoring team, averaging only 69.7 points per game. However, all 12 of its athletes have consistently contributed to its scoring and the team has had nine different starters this year.</p>\n                <p>Redshirt junior Tara Daye leads the Boilermakers with 12.6 points per game after transferring from St. John\u2019s. Junior Kiki Smith has also been a high-scorer, averaging 10.2 points per game after her year at Arkansas.</p>\n                <p>Purdue\u2019s solid starters will be tested when high-scoring Kiyomi McMiller, Moriah Murray and Merkle come to town on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/men_basketball/weekly-recap-penn-state-men-s-basketball-narrowly-falls-to-ranked-opponents/article_ab7c4eea-b6fb-439a-9931-90512c131108.html\" target=\"_blank\">Well, it\u2019s been a while since a recap on Penn State men\u2019s basketball was released, and it\u2019s fair to say a recap is needed.</a></p>\n                <p>The last published recap was in mid-January, and it appeared the Nittany Lions had a chance to turn a corner after a three-game losing skid against ranked opponents to start the new year.</p>\n                <p>Yet, since that stretch, the blue and white dropped five straight until it finally got back into the win column, and the need to reflect is at a peak. Now, 1-10 in the Big Ten and 10-12 overall, the blue and white have a chance to not only finish on a strong note, but with some momentum for the future.</p>\n                <p>Really, now?</p>\n                <p>The play on the court hasn\u2019t been ideal over the last couple of weeks, and the personnel available haven\u2019t been consistent either. Top scorers Freddie Dilione V and Kayden Mingo endured light nicks that affected their play, while all three international big men, Sas\u01ce Ciani, Ivan Juri\u0107, and Tibor Mirti\u0107, all missed action due to various reasons.</p>\n                <p>The injuries fractured morale and the quality of play, which hadn\u2019t been high over the end of January and into February. With conference play in its full swing, it\u2019s a disastrous time to see high-profile absences and to endure those devastating losses at the same time. For a young squad that didn\u2019t earn its first Big Ten win until a last-second Mingo buzzer-beater over Minnesota, the emotions within the team are extremely volatile, and fate hasn\u2019t necessarily been the kindest.</p>\n                <p>Moving forward, a unit that has endured small setbacks at potentially the worst times has a chance to show that those unforeseen circumstances are why the season did not go well, rather than because of the player\u2019s limited ceiling.</p>\n                <p>Rewarding Reed</p>\n                <p>As the results haven\u2019t been good, neither have the players' performances. The one silver lining over the past few weeks of play is the emergence of Josh Reed as a primary scorer for Penn State. Prior to these last contests, the lone senior on the Nittany Lions was reduced to a leadership role, where most of his contributions are limited to intangibles that don\u2019t show up in the box score.</p>\n                <p>While that\u2019s been largely the story for Reed\u2019s entire collegiate career, the Atlanta native saw his role morph as the Penn State absences piled up, and the wing with a career average of 4.1 points per game reached double-digit scoring in his last six outings.</p>\n                <p>He scored 18 points twice, also over those couple of weeks, only one short of his career high.</p>\n                <p>Over that stretch, Reed has been efficient despite not being a primary scorer; in those six games, he has averaged over 30 minutes and shot over 50% in every game but one.</p>\n                <p>Where does the scoring come?</p>\n                <p>While Reed took the scoring reins over the past couple of weeks, scoring also became more spread out in atypical ways. Eli Rice, Mingo, Reed and Dilione all took times as leading scorers, and those four contribute their baskets in different ways.</p>\n                <p>Rice has the three-point shot, Dilione the slick handles, Mingo a unique downhill speed and Reed a unforeseen veteran scrapiness. The Nittany Lions have developed the ability to score by anyone and in any way; the only uphill battle now is doing so consistently and together.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Max Granville, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>2.Yvan Kemajou, sophomore</p>\n                <p>3. Ikenna Ezeogu, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>4. Alexander McPherson, sophomore</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defensive end room is completely revamped from a season ago, with Dani Dennis-Sutton exhausting eligibility and Zuriah Fisher, Chaz Coleman and Jaylen Harvey all transferring.</p>\n                <p>In turn, the edge rusher spot will be a younger crew next year. The two projected starters are Max Granville and Yvan Kemajou.</p>\n                <p>Granville missed all of 2025 with injury, but saw his stock rise at the end of 2024 as a rotational piece in the playoffs and notably filled in for Abdul Carter when he left the Fiesta Bowl due to injury.</p>\n                <p>Kemajou burned his redshirt last year, appearing in 10 games where he notched 13 total tackles and 1.5 sacks. Behind them will be a pair of transfers in Ikenna Ezeogu from Iowa State and Alexander McPherson from Colorado.</p>\n                <p>Ezeogu will be the rare veteran in the group of defensive ends, having recorded 60 total tackles, and three sacks since 2023. McPherson appeared in 10 games for the Buffaloes, tallying 16 total tackles, six quarterback pressures and a blocked punt.</p>\n                <p>Defensive tackle</p>\n                <p>1.Siale Taupaki, redshirt senior +</p>\n                <p>2. Keanu Williams, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>3. Dallas Vakalahi, junior</p>\n                <p>4. Armstrong Nnodim, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Just like defensive end, Penn State will need to fill in holes at defensive tackle with Zane Durant and Alonzo Ford Jr. off to the NFL as well as Xavier Gilliam transferring.</p>\n                <p>The starters will be Siale Taupaki and Keanu Williams, who both come from UCLA. Taupaki is entering his eighth year of college football, which has featured a handful of injuries and switching from defensive line to offensive line and then back to defensive line.</p>\n                <p>Williams spent his first two years at Oregon before his last three with the Bruins, and has posted 59 total tackles in his collegiate career.</p>\n                <p>Behind the ex-Bruins will be Dallas Vakalahi from Utah and Armstrong Nnodim from Oklahoma State. Valkalahi recorded 27 total tackles with the Utes in two seasons while Nnodim had 11 total tackles in 2025 after redshirting the year before.</p>\n                <p>Linebacker</p>\n                <p>WILL:</p>\n                <p>1. Tony Rojas, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>2. Cael Brezina, junior</p>\n                <p>MIKE:</p>\n                <p>1. Caleb Bacon, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Rojas</p>\n                <p>SAM:</p>\n                <p>1. Kooper Ebel, senior</p>\n                <p>2. Alex Tatsch, sophomore</p>\n                <p>Penn State will need to replace the production of Amare Campbell, who garnered 103 total tackles in his lone season in State College after transferring in from North Carolina and has since transferred to Tennessee.</p>\n                <p>The bright spot for the Nittany Lions is the return of Tony Rojas, who suffered a long-term injury following the loss to Oregon. Before that, Rojas was playing some solid ball, notching 25 total tackles and a pair of sacks. He\u2019s a strong candidate to be a captain in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Outside of Rojas, the reinforcements at linebacker come from Iowa State, as the top-three players at the position for the Cyclones a year ago, Caleb Bacon, Kooper Ebel and Cael Brezina, bring their talents to Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Bacon and Ebel combined for 145 tackles, while Brezina chipped in 29 himself.</p>\n                <p>Another name to keep an eye on is Alex Tatsch, who saw an uptick in snaps to end 2025 and burned his redshirt in the process. He suffered an injury during bowl prep leading up to the Pinstripe Bowl, and there is no current update on his status moving forward.</p>\n                <p>Cornerback</p>\n                <p>Outside:</p>\n                <p>1. Audavion Collins, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Daryus Dixson, sophomore</p>\n                <p>3. Jahmir Joseph, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>Nickel:</p>\n                <p>1. Zion Tracy, senior</p>\n                <p>2. Omarion Davis, sophomore</p>\n                <p>As far as retaining talent, the cornerback room had a successful offseason despite losing A.J. Harris and Elliot Washington II to the transfer portal, back are Audavion Collins, Daryus Dixson, Zion Tracy and Jahmir Joseph.</p>\n                <p>Collins, Dixson and Tracy all started in the Pinstripe Bowl \u2014 Collins and Tracy were starters the whole year.</p>\n                <p>Collins has been one of the program\u2019s biggest risers over the last few years, earning himself a starting job in 2025 after transferring in from Mississippi State in 2023. In 2025, he had 47 total tackles and three pass breakups in his first year as a starter.</p>\n                <p>Dixson was a huge recruiting win in the 2025 class, as he was a highly touted prospect from national powerhouse Mater Dei in California. He burned his redshirted and surpassed Harris and Washington for playing time by the end of the regular season, accumulating 22 total tackles and six pass break ups.</p>\n                <p>Tracy held down the nickel spot, tallying 32 tackles with five tackles for loss a year ago. He missed two games at the start of the year due to injury, where ex-Nittany Lion Kenny Woseley Jr. started, but he has since transferred to Virginia Tech.</p>\n                <p>Jahmir Joseph is a young player who flashed with a pick-6 against Villanova. He maintained his redshirt, but saw extended run in the Pinstripe Bowl, logging five total tackles and a pass breakup.</p>\n                <p>Boston College transfer Omarion Davis could be a candidate to be the backup nickel. 2025 was his freshman year, where he played in all 12 games with a pair of starts, recording 13 total tackles. Davis played safety for the Eagles, but has the athletic profile to slot in at nickel with his 5-foot-11, 185-pound frame.</p>\n                <p>Safety</p>\n                <p>Strong safety:</p>\n                <p>1. Marcus Neal Jr., junior</p>\n                <p>2. Vaboue Toure, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Free safety:</p>\n                <p>1. Jeremiah Cooper, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Jamison Patton, senior</p>\n                <p>Safety is another position where Penn State will see a handful of new faces with Zakee Wheatley off to the NFL as well as King Mack and Dejuan Lane transferring.</p>\n                <p>Iowa State transfer Marcus Neal Jr. will start at strong safety, coming off of a 2025 campaign where he started as a sophomore, and a third-team All-Big 12 selection. Other than quarterback Rocco Becht, he is viewed to be the biggest addition via the portal for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Alongside him at free safety will be ex-Cyclone Jeremiah Cooper, who was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2023, but missed 2025 after four games due to a season-ending knee injury. During his time with Iowa State, he garnered 138 total tackles and eight interceptions.</p>\n                <p>Cooper started his career as a safety, but moved to cornerback in 2025. However, the path for playing time is easier for him at safety with the room having more uncertainties than cornerback.</p>\n                <p>For rotational pieces, Penn State has Vaboue Toure and Iowa State transfer Jamison Patton.</p>\n                <p>Through three seasons with the Cyclones, Patton recorded 79 total tackles and four interceptions. If Cooper starts at cornerback, Patton will likely be the favorite to start at free safety next to Neal.</p>\n                <p>Toure appeared in 11 games in 2025 after redshirting the year before, notching 13 total tackles and a sack. He flashed in the Pinstripe Bowl with seven total tackles.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "\u2018Really proud of him\u2019 | Freddie Dilione V showcases scrappy playstyle to help Penn State beat Minnesota",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Mike Rhoades told his players to \u201cempty the tank\u201d before facing Minnesota, with the team dealing with a smaller rotation due to multiple injuries, and one player in particular seemed to take that to heart.</p>\n                <p>Guard Freddie Dilione V tied his career-high with 25 points to help lead the Nittany Lions to a 77-75 win over the Golden Gophers on Sunday, but it wasn\u2019t just his offense that stuck out to Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFreddie can make plays, and what I was proud of Freddie today is he played defense,\u201d Rhoades said postgame. \u201cHe played defense. He had five rebounds. He was in some scuffles. He was going after the ball today.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dilione played with a high motor on defense, totaling three steals in addition to his four defensive rebounds, which is the second most he\u2019s gotten in Big Ten play this season. His steal at the 13:44 mark of the first half led to him making a fast-break dunk to give Penn State an early 15-9 lead.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt junior\u2019s defense helped set up offensive possessions for the Nittany Lions. Dilione shot 64.7% from the field, which is his third-best shooting percentage of the season.</p>\n                <p>Entering Sunday\u2019s matchup, Dilione hadn\u2019t shot more than 50% from the field since the Pitt game on Dec. 21. He was held to 8.2 points per game between the UCLA and Northwestern games \u2014 a stark change for a player who\u2019s usually in double figures.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHad a bad stretch the past few games but finally found it again,\u201d Dilione said postgame. \u201cIt was really no plan to it, just mental, just stuff I've been doing. Shout out to (point guard Kayden Mingo). He got me the ball.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Dilione was sitting next to Mingo during a postgame availability, and the two smiled at each other after Dilione gave credit to Mingo. In response, Mingo said that Dilione was scoring on his own throughout the game, highlighting his shot-creation ability.</p>\n                <p>When he scores on his own, Dilione typically finds his spot: typically a mid-range jumper near the free-throw line. He had two unassisted baskets in the second half, including one at the 6:31 mark to give the Nittany Lions a 69-58 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Dilione made a few other key plays down the stretch, such as his offensive rebound with 5:02 left in the game, leading to a second-chance bucket by forward Josh Reed. That basket was made possible by Dilione, and it gave Penn State enough cushion to fend off a late comeback attempt by Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>As the Golden Gophers came storming back, Dilione got a layup to fall to generate a 73-70 Penn State lead with 2:09 left. He was also an option on the final possession of the game, but Mingo ended up keeping the ball for himself.</p>\n                <p>Regardless, the plays that Dilione showcased Sunday are what Rhoades is looking for out of him moving forward.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don't mean in a negative way, but like, we need a dirty Freddie,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe need him to be grimy because we all know he could score. And he did that today. I told him, \u2018If you don't do that, it's gonna be really hard.\u2019 And he did that. He scrapped tonight. Really proud of him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Emma Naysmith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>With THON Weekend 2026 just a little over two weeks away, it\u2019s time for dancers to begin preparing for the highly anticipated 46 hours.</p>\n                <p>THON is the world's largest student-run philanthropy that aims to provide emotional and financial support to Four Diamonds families who have been impacted by childhood cancer.</p>\n                <p>Dancer Relations Committee Outreach Coordinator Olivia Johnston said THON provides several resources for dancers to help prepare themselves for the long weekend.</p>\n                <p>Some of these resources include dancer wellness packets, a more thorough dancer wellness guide, a dancer survival guide and the opportunity to attend a virtual dancer panel where first-time participants can ask previous dancers questions.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere isn't a specific plan we recommend, like a step-by-step guide of how to perfectly prepare to stand for 46 hours,\u201d Johnston, a fourth-year studying psychology, said. \u201cIn general, we suggest to hydrate, eat healthy, light workouts, nothing too strenuous on your body and definitely stretch.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Johnston also mentioned dancers are encouraged to get ahead on sleep and build their immunity prior to the weekend. Additionally, she said another huge tip is to begin reducing caffeine intake and even entering a dry period to help further avoid any illnesses or withdrawals.</p>\n                <p>THON dancers are also supported by Dancer Relations Committee members (DRCM) who they\u2019re encouraged to meet prior to the weekend. Johnston said these committee members are \u201cwell-rounded\u201d in their education to help support dancers in numerous instances.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey have all the specific times that they need to know, special event times, floor event times, anything that will keep them entertained,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThey also are being educated on mental health tips and tricks and how to deal with \u2026 the mental aspect of dancing for 46 hours.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Second-generation THON dancer Maddie Langlois danced last year with Alpha Kappa Psi and said it was an amazing experience to have been a part of.</p>\n                <p>Langlois, a fourth-year studying marketing, said THON does a lot to provide dancers with resources and support. She remembers when struggling at one point, her DRCM stepped in and was \u201cso helpful.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cEven though that was one of the hardest weekends, it's only a fraction of what some of these families are dealing with,\u201d Langlois said. \u201cIt's really eye opening and has really altered the path of my life and how I view things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Langlois said it was difficult to prepare for standing, but believes mental preparation can make a significant impact.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYour feet are going to hurt and you're going to be tired,\u201d Langlois said. \u201cBut if your mind is still with it, then I think that really helps.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Throughout the weekend, Langlois remembers thinking about her organization's THON families through the Adopt-a-Family (AAF) program, and particularly one child who was going through a difficult time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you can think of something that's why you're THON-ing \u2026 that can be really helpful to say it to yourself, and stick with that throughout the weekend,\u201d Langlois said. \u201cBecause then you're like, \u2018This is why I'm here. This is why I'm doing this. This is super important to me.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>Benjamin Guenther found out in November that he was chosen to dance by his brothers at Delta Sigma Pi, alongside two of his roommates.</p>\n                <p>Physically, Guenther, a fourth-year studying agricultural and biorenewable systems management, said he and his fellow dancing brothers have started eating clean, avoiding large crowds to prevent sickness and staying physically in shape. He even said that he and about 30 of his brothers ran the Philadelphia Half Marathon together.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe keep thinking of how hard our brothers are working, how hard they have worked, not only just for THON Weekend, but this whole entire year is a fundraising year in total, and then just helping our families, knowing that this isn't a fight that they have to go through for a year,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cThis is a fight they have to go through their whole entire life. We just have to stand for 46 hours.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Guenther also said he is looking forward to DSP\u2019s THON gala, where all of the dancers, THON chairs and AAF families have the opportunity to speak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSeeing how we've really been able to give into our families, lets you put down everything \u2026 and really allow for yourself to become more prepared for THON Weekend,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cIt really allows for our dancers to become extremely motivated for this weekend, and to see how hard every single brother has worked, and see how much our families really have appreciated that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Guenther said DSP THON enforces the idea that THON is a community, a home and a place for all \u2014 whether it be your first THON or your last.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFrom an internal perspective on THON, it's impossible to explain, but from an external perspective on THON, it's impossible to understand,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cYou could go around anywhere in the country, and you're not going to find something like this.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE THON CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Talia Rittenhouse | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Entering the new year, it\u2019s time to transport back to the beloved era, 2016.</p>\n                <p>Picture it \u2014 it\u2019s giving Tumblr, palm trees, Justin Bieber in his prime and selfies galore.</p>\n                <p>Many trends emerged in 2016 across fashion, makeup and various styles. However, some should stay back in those years of frappuccinos, Dubsmash and ombre Instagram filters. On the other hand, some trends should absolutely be welcomed back in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Here's what we should leave in 2016 and bring back in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Leave in 2016</p>\n                <p>Flower crowns</p>\n                <p>Most popularly purchased at Claire\u2019s, Justice and pretty much any store at this time.</p>\n                <p>I think this one will be widely agreed upon to leave in 2016. I\u2019m not sure people will enjoy struggling to see the boards in class, dodging the arrangements of flowers atop students\u2019 heads.</p>\n                <p>While I understand there\u2019s a vision here with the springtime fashion, in 2026, especially in the winter, it's not the time to bring this back.</p>\n                <p>Not to mention how uncomfortable they were, getting stuck in people\u2019s hair \u2014 I'm surprised the trend didn\u2019t end sooner, 10 years ago.</p>\n                <p>Colored sunglasses</p>\n                <p>Now this one can remain in 2016, the classic Five Below colored rim and colored lens sunglasses.</p>\n                <p>Personally, I had an embarrassingly large collection of these, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in this statement, considering the generation of students here at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>They came in any color you could imagine, sat on the shelves at almost every store, and yet, the trend only lasted a year or so, at least it should have.</p>\n                <p>So yes, these were still being worn in 2018, but that is not an explanation to why they should return and disrupt fashion 10 years later.</p>\n                <p>Infinity Scarves</p>\n                <p>These were perfect for their time. They were stylish with a sweater and jeans, but only in 2016.</p>\n                <p>Now in State College, our infinity scarves have slowly morphed into the scarves we wear on campus to keep warm in the treacherous wind and negative temperatures.</p>\n                <p>However, this does not mean they need to return in polkadot patterns, plaid and other prints, nor stay on throughout classes.</p>\n                <p>So again, and respectfully, let\u2019s stick to this trend in keeping warm, and not as a revived style.</p>\n                <p>Revive in 2026</p>\n                <p>Jean shorts</p>\n                <p>Now this one I would love to see make a comeback in 2026.</p>\n                <p>While jean shorts can be uncomfortable, they provide an easy and simple go-to outfit option for the spring and summer.</p>\n                <p>That said, please, oh please, the studded jean shorts do not need to make a reappearance. In combination with styles these days, I think our wardrobes would slowly begin to resemble the Justice displays from our local malls with this style of shorts.</p>\n                <p>But jean shorts are a perfect staple, just like the jeans students wear to class and out at night.</p>\n                <p>Baby Lips and EOS</p>\n                <p>Lip glosses and chapsticks are still a current trend this year, ranging from Summer Fridays to Burt's Bees.</p>\n                <p>I see this as a perfect opportunity for EOS and Maybelline Baby Lips to come back to our makeup drawers and bags on a night out.</p>\n                <p>And talk about cute \u2014 students at all schools can fall in love when a package is colorful, appealing and contains a high-quality product.</p>\n                <p>They\u2019re compact and sold in a variety of scents, ranging from fruity to sweet, just like the lip glosses used today.</p>\n                <p>Dark eyeshadow</p>\n                <p>If done correctly, I see no issues with the return of dark eye shadow.</p>\n                <p>The bold look is fun on occasion, especially when adding glitter. A dark eyeshadow color can make your eyes pop and bring your makeup look together.</p>\n                <p>However, brightly colored eye shadow is a different story.</p>\n                <p>Using blue eyeshadow is a little too \u201880s to bring back as a 2016 trend, but the choice is yours in how you want to take advantage of this trend.</p>\n                <p>MORE BLOGS</p>",

    "author": "Lexie Linderman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>With just over two months until the NFL draft, preparations are in full swing for the graduating Penn Staters that are hoping to hear their name called at the end of April.</p>\n                <p>A few participated in the Senior Bowl this past week, but none played in the actual game on Saturday, which the American Team won 17-9. They all practiced, however.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a recap of the week for these former Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Nick Singleton, running back</p>\n                <p>Nick Singleton would\u2019ve been one of the highest-drafted running backs last year after a 1,099-yard season, but he opted to return to Penn State for 2025 and use the last of his eligibility.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately for Singleton, his draft stock took a slight tumble. He struggled to start the season and eventually had his playing time reduced to make way for Kaytron Allen, but his athletic abilities remained undeniable as he finished his career as the program leader in career rushing touchdowns, all-purpose yards and total touchdowns.</p>\n                <p>He had a chance to put his athleticism on display at Senior Bowl practice this week, especially impressing during pass protection, but he <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/football/report-penn-state-rb-nick-singleton-breaks-foot-at-senior-bowl-his-father-says/article_fcebedc2-d9f9-4315-a084-3849c9fcd360.html\" target=\"_blank\">broke his foot</a> on Thursday, sidelining him for the foreseeable future and any other pre-draft showcases.</p>\n                <p>ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper has Singleton as the No. 6 running back available, and he\u2019s projected to be a third-round pick.</p>\n                <p>Dani Dennis-Sutton, defensive end</p>\n                <p>The Pinstripe Bowl proved the kind of teammate and player Dani Dennis-Sutton can be in the big leagues, and he took that one step further at the Senior Bowl this week.</p>\n                <p>Dennis-Sutton was impressive throughout a week of practice, although he didn\u2019t participate in the actual game. He won battles with ease and put pressure on opposing quarterbacks while showcasing his athleticism.</p>\n                <p>Dani Dennis-Sutton with a win against Kage Casey <a href=\"https://t.co/sM4kTKtiZZ\">pic.twitter.com/sM4kTKtiZZ</a>&mdash; Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CFBMaxChadwick/status/2016255604151472205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>The defensive end had a slight injury scare and was down on the field for a bit at one point, but he walked off on his own power and appears to have avoided injury.</p>\n                <p>Zakee Wheatley, safety</p>\n                <p>One of Penn State\u2019s best defensive players this season headed to the Senior Bowl to show scouts what he\u2019s made of, and he earned some hardware afterwards.</p>\n                <p>Zakee Wheatley was named the Safety of the Week by his fellow participants and the scouts in attendance, a high honor for the former Nittany Lion that\u2019s one of the top safeties available in the 2026 class.</p>\n                <p>Wheatley measured in at 6-foot-3 and confirmed to reporters that he\u2019ll be at the NFL Scouting Combine at the end of the month.</p>\n                <p>Zane Durant, defensive tackle</p>\n                <p>Zane Durant fell short of the expectation set for him in 2025, much like his team, so he headed to the Senior Bowl to prove he\u2019s still a top defensive tackle available in this year\u2019s NFL draft.</p>\n                <p>Durant seriously impressed throughout Senior Bowl practice, moving right past interior offensive linemen and showcasing his agility and quickness throughout. Additionally, PFF named him a standout on Day 2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State DT Zane Durant was too quick for most of the interior OL in Mobile <a href=\"https://t.co/91chLFWfPK\">pic.twitter.com/91chLFWfPK</a>&mdash; Joe DeLeone (@joedeleone) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joedeleone/status/2016453784830939507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>The defensive tackle showcased why he was named a preseason All-American by numerous outlets and likely boosted his draft stock as a result.</p>\n                <p>Kaytron Allen, running back</p>\n                <p>Kaytron Allen put plenty of good things on tape this season, racking up 1,303 yards and breaking Penn State\u2019s all-time rushing record.</p>\n                <p>Allen headed to the Senior Bowl to prove his prowess to scouts, where he dazzled in pass protection and displayed his natural burst with the ball. Allen is currently ranked as the No. 5 running back available, per ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper.</p>\n                <p>RB Kaytron Allen with the nice cut and burst through the hole, followed by SAF Deshon Singleton flying downhill to make the tackle.

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State was off to a 0-10 start to Big Ten play this season, and the Nittany Lions were shorthanded due to multiple injuries before facing Minnesota on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>Despite that, the blue and white managed to pull off a gutsy 77-75 victory over the Golden Gophers courtesy of guard Kayden Mingo\u2019s last-second shot to win. It marked Penn State\u2019s first win over a power-conference opponent this year and ended an eight-game losing streak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's a good sense of relief,\u201d guard Freddie Dilione V said postgame. \u201cGetting our first win in conference is big for us. We just got to carry it over to the next game, and just keep the momentum going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions erupted in celebration after Mingo\u2019s basket. The Bryce Jordan Center crowd was going wild, and at long last to those connected to the program, Penn State picked up a win in Big Ten play this season.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad effort was evident throughout Sunday\u2019s game, which came from a \u201cnext man up\u201d mentality with frontcourt pieces Ivan Juri\u0107, Tibor Mirti\u0107 and Sa\u0161a Ciani all sidelined. Wing Eli Rice also picked up an injury during the game, bringing Penn State\u2019s rotation down to seven scholarship players.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGetting the first win in probably the toughest conference in the country is really big,\u201d Mingo said postgame. \u201cIt could be anybody's game any night, and I feel like we had a lot of people step up tonight, and we can continue to use that moving forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to Sunday\u2019s game, the Nittany Lions' losses ranged from last-second letdowns to blowouts, including last week\u2019s 94-73 loss to Northwestern and the 113-72 defeat to Indiana in December.</p>\n                <p>On the other hand, Penn State took then-No. 2 Michigan down to the buzzer before losing 74-72 on Jan. 6, among other single-digit losses throughout the month of January. Now, the Nittany Lions can say they\u2019ve closed out a win during crunchtime in Big Ten play, even after Minnesota evaporated a 10-point lead late.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's a relief, without a doubt,\u201d Rhoades said postgame. \u201cYou do this long enough, you go through all different emotions and seasons and months. January was not a lot of fun around here. We had stretches of good basketball against good teams, but not good enough to win, and so today was just enough to win.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Even with all the losses Penn State endured, Rhoades typically always praised his players\u2019 response. He\u2019s said they are a \u201cvery coachable\u201d group that\u2019s looking to improve.</p>\n                <p>Following the win over the Golden Gophers, the players have a positive result to build on. Regardless, Rhoades still has the same review regarding his group of guys.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel for them because you have a certain way you want your season to go or your games to go, and when it doesn't go that way, you can always have issues and problems. We don't,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe just got to get better. Today was a little bit of validation that these guys are doing things the right way. I'm really proud of them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Kayden Mingo had the ball at halfcourt during Penn State\u2019s final possession against Minnesota on Sunday. Unbeknownst to him, he was about to make arguably the biggest basket of his young career.</p>\n                <p>The point guard charged down low, pivoted around several times before taking a step into the paint and laying in a game-winning shot to give the Nittany Lions a 77-75 victory over the Golden Gophers. Mingo\u2019s teammates rushed to him in celebration as the Bryce Jordan Center crowd went wild to cap off his strong finish to the game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCoach drew up the play for me, and that was all she wrote from there,\u201d Mingo said postgame. \u201cI got downhill, made sure I played like my coaches teach me, and made a good play. He played good defense, though, as well. It felt great. It felt great having all my teammates going to me, congratulate me, and having their trust and my coaches' trust. I give all the thanks and glory to Jesus Christ and my teammates for being there for me and my coaches for instilling confidence.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo thought on a play before his game-winner that Penn State\u2019s defense would\u2019ve been called for goaltending, which he said would\u2019ve made his squad push the ball down court quickly and try for a fast basket.</p>\n                <p>Instead, Minnesota was shooting free throws before Mingo\u2019s play. Since Golden Gophers forward Langston Reynolds went 1-of-2 at the line, Mike Rhoades told his team to hold the ball for the last 30 seconds to get the last shot, according to Mingo.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades could\u2019ve opted to use guard Freddie Dilione V, who scored a career-high 25 points, on the last possession, but went with Mingo as he felt the freshman star was driving well toward the end of the game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat I was proud about Kayden there is being a freshman guard in that situation,\u201d Rhoades said postgame. \u201cHe didn't panic. He's a strong pivoter. He's a tough kid with the ball.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo didn\u2019t get off to a fast start in Sunday\u2019s game. In fact, he was held to just two points in the first half and was shooting 1-of-9 to begin the contest.</p>\n                <p>However, around the midway point of the second half, Mingo made back-to-back layups to get going. He finished the game off with 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals with 6-of-17 shooting in 37 minutes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like once my teammates started to make more and more shots, it started to open up and I came out a little bit more aggressive in the second half,\u201d Mingo said.</p>\n                <p>Mingo also had multiple key baskets before his clutch shot at the end of the game. At the 8:39 mark of the second half, he sank a 3-pointer to give Penn State a 63-58 lead, and he made a layup with 49 seconds left to generate a 75-72 advantage for his squad.</p>\n                <p>At local media day back in October, Mingo said he\u2019s \u201ca winner before anything.\u201d He had poise throughout the crunch time of the Nittany Lions' victory over Minnesota, showcasing that mentality.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's so electric and quick getting downhill,\u201d Minnesota head coach Niko Medved said postgame. \u201cHe plays with such balance, too. He's able to get by guys, and he plays on balance. He can play off at two feet. He uses his pivots well. He's an aggressive, attacking kid. He's got a really, really bright future.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Elliott Inscho | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Hunter Aquino ended 2025 by being named a second-team Inside Lacrosse All-American, and he showed why he was deserving of that honor in the first game of his 2026 campaign.</p>\n                <p>Aquino, the reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year, scored five goals in Holuba Hall en route to an 18-14 victory for Penn State on Sunday.</p>\n                <p>That mark set a new career high for the sophomore out of Easton, Pennsylvania. His prior best-of-three came against Princeton last season, another game that was played indoors.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that comes out every day,\u201d coach Jeff Tambroni said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a moment, whether it\u2019s a practice or a game, where you\u2019re going to see a change in his attitude [or] his confidence.\u201d</p>\n                <p>That confidence was paramount to Aquino\u2019s strong showing on Sunday. To go along with his goals, he recorded an assist and two ground balls, capping a solid all-around performance.</p>\n                <p>Last season, most of Aquino\u2019s reps came as a midfielder, but after the departure of Matt Traynor from the attack line, Tambroni dropped the 6-foot-5 star down to replace the PLL-bound Traynor in 2026.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s still learning how to play the position,\u201d Tambroni said. \u201cYou have to learn it through the course of the season. It\u2019s a hard position to play. He\u2019s the catalyst of things that are going on on the offensive end.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Early returns suggest that the change worked for both Aquino and the Nittany Lions as a whole. His six points in his attack debut were the most by any Penn State player.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(I was) definitely a little bit nervous,\u201d Aquino said, \u201cWhen I shot the ball into the goalie\u2019s stick, (my teammates) said \u2018keep shooting, keep shooting.\u2019 Just having that trust from them makes my job so much easier.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Aquino\u2019s season-opener was strong, there will be bigger challenges ahead for the sophomore. Tambroni noted that while he put in a good performance on Sunday, there\u2019s still a lot to learn for the preseason Big Ten Player to Watch.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe has to be in different situations,\u201d Tambroni said, \u201cand learn how to manage when we\u2019re down, when we\u2019re up, tighter situations, all situations. Throughout the course of the year, we\u2019ll learn a lot more about this.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Not only was Aquino strong, but the entire offense\u2019s chemistry was clearly on display in the victory over Colgate, with ten different players recording a goal for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Aquino was one of three Penn State players with a hat trick, to go along with fellow attackman Kyle Lehman and redshirt senior Michael Faraone.</p>\n                <p>The attack unit specifically was strong in the victory, combining for nine goals and 14 total points. Despite Liam Matthews, who recorded 34 points in 2025, being sidelined with an injury, the unit seemed comfortable with one another.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe love this group,\u201d Aquino said. \u201cWe love getting to know each other. The freshman, (Jack) Iannantuono, is an unbelievable player. Lehman is one of the best attackmen in the country. It\u2019s just so easy to play with them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Caroline Riley | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Coming off a massive 197.000+ victory last week, Penn State traveled to Piscataway, New Jersey, to try to repeat that performance against a typical Big Ten foe.</p>\n                <p>Despite being unable to match last week\u2019s huge 197.250, the Nittany Lions still hit 49.000+ on each event to beat Rutgers 196.375-194.575.</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>Ellie Monahan started the rotation with a few small mistakes, which lowered her score to a 9.775. She was short on a few handstands and took a small on her full twisting double back.</p>\n                <p>Jessica Johanson\u2019s routine was really strong on the bars. She caught her reverse hecht a little close, but she also had a small hop back on her double layout for a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Small hop on double layout.</p>\n                <p>Elizabeth Leary was strong on the bar. She held on to a close handstand at the end of her routine. Her biggest deductions came from not just a small hop back on her dismount but also a small step after, for a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>The freshman Ava Cash had a beautiful routine. She showcased her long lines with perfect handstands throughout and had great distance on her piked Jaeger. However, like her teammates, she had a small shuffle back on her double back for a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>Ava Peidrahita scored a low 9.400 because her start value was lowered after she missed her Maloney to Pak Salto combination. She needed an extra swing and took a hop on her dismount.</p>\n                <p>Dani Latronica got the team back on track in a huge way with an event-winning 9.925 and a great stuck landing. Penn State took the lead 49.200-48.825.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Leary opened the rotation with a full twisting Yurchenko. She had a larger than .100 hop, lowering her score to a 9.750. Cash followed up with her own Yurchenko full. She had massive height and just a small hop back for a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Allison Kaempfer with her big 10.0 start value Yurchenko 1.5. She was slightly underrotated and had to take a hop back, lowering her score to 9.750. Latronica followed with a strong Yurchenko, taking just a small hop for a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>Johanson followed up with a similar performance and a 9.800 of her own after just a hop on the landing. Piedrahita, after her mistake on bars, bounced back in a big way with an event-winning 9.925. Penn State widens its lead over Rutgers 98.325-97.575</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>The floor was Penn State\u2019s lowest scoring event of the day, coming in at just 49.025. Leary led off with a strong 9.850 after controlling each of her passes. Monahan followed up with a similar routine, scoring a 9.800. She stuck her second pass cold.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Maul started her routine off with a strong double back, but was short on her second pass, ultimately sitting her front layout down. She scored only a 9.000, putting pressure on the remaining gymnasts to hit.</p>\n                <p>Bella Misiura got the team back on track with a 9.775. She had some form issues in her front double full and took a slightly uncontrolled step forward, but stuck her final pass cold. Alyssa Kramer had a similar routine with her front double full and solid final pass for a 9.750.</p>\n                <p>Kalea McElligott closed out the rotation much like it began, with a 9.850. She had too much power on her opening double back and had to move her front foot back as well in her lunge, but had a strong one-and-a-half to front layout to finish.</p>\n                <p>Penn State remained ahead of Rutgers 147.350-145.975 as Rutgers struggled to score 49.000+ on any rotation.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Monahan, coming off last week\u2019s career high, was unable to replicate that performance, scoring a 9.775 to start off the rotation. She had a strong acro combination, but was a little unsteady on her full turn. She took a hop forward on her dismount and drifted to the side.</p>\n                <p>Leary began the string of triple series for Penn State but took a balance check at the end. She also needed a balance check on her full turn. She managed to hold on to her stuck dismount but scored a low 9.625.</p>\n                <p>Maul nailed her triple acro series and showcased complete control throughout her routine. She stuck her dismount for a big 9.875 in the third spot. She matched her career high.</p>\n                <p>McElligott started her routine with a clean triple series. Her back leg was a little off on her leap series, and she took a small hop on her dismount for a 9.750.</p>\n                <p>Kramer had an extremely solid routine. She was a little slow to make her leap connection but had virtually no wobbles throughout her routine. She stuck her dismount to follow up last week\u2019s career high with just a slightly lower 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Latronica anchored the rotation with a 9.800. She needed to circle her arms twice after her acro series, which was a bit of a wobble, but had a strong rest of the routine, including a stuck gainer full off the side.</p>\n                <p>Penn State scored the same as the floor for a 49.025 as Rutgers struggled in its final rotation, having to count a 9.550.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State heads for the big SEC stage as it takes on LSU in Baton Rouge at 7:30 p.m. Friday.</p>\n                <p>MOIRE GYMNASTICS CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The losers of its last eight consecutive games, Penn State entered its matchup against Minnesota with one goal: pick up its first conference win.</p>\n                <p>A Big Ten win has been evasive for the Nittany Lions this season, but the blue and white finally put it together against the Golden Gophers, picking up a 77-75 buzzer-beating win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief, without a doubt,\u201d Mike Rhoades said about the win. \u201cJanuary wasn\u2019t fun around here. We had stretches of good basketball against good teams, but not big enough, not experienced enough, good enough to win. Today was just enough to win\u2026 Today was a little bit of validation that these guys are doing things the right way.</p>\n                <p>Penn State missed out on getting the opening points after a Dominick Stewart three-pointer wouldn\u2019t fall, leading to Minnesota\u2019s leading scorer, Cade Tyson getting fouled on the fast break and converting from the charity stripe to strike first.</p>\n                <p>The two sides were trading points in the early running but the Nittany Lions were pulling ahead thanks to Freddie Dilione V and Josh Reed scoring in bunches on their way to a 15-9 lead.</p>\n                <p>Dilione capped off the day matching his career-high of 25 points while Reed finished with 18 points, just one point away from tying his career-high of 19.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThose two guys have all the experience\u2026 Josh is an awesome young man. He\u2019s a really good teammate. He cares about people\u2026 since he got here in June he took the team out to eat multiple times on his dime. Who does that? Being a good teammate and taking care of your teammates and the young guys, that\u2019s important to him\u2026 and he\u2019s having the best individual season he\u2019s ever had,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cFreddie can make plays\u2026 he played defense, he had five rebounds. He was in some scuffles going after the ball today\u2026 we need a dirty Freddie.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A Justin Houser basket off the assist by Kayden Mingo gave the blue and white a five point lead before Minnesota coach Niko Medved called timeout.</p>\n                <p>In basketball, a \u201ckill\u201d is when a team forces three consecutive defensive stops. Minnesota had been unable to get a kill at the six-minute media timeout, a large reason Penn State had been so successful on offense to that point.</p>\n                <p>As Dilione notched his 13th point, the Nittany Lions captured a 10 point lead and looked just about as good as they have all season with a 31-21 advantage.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions missed out on extending their lead to 15 points, unable to get anything to fall for a couple of possessions until a Reed three-pointer made it a 39-29 ballgame with just over a minute remaining in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Penn State took to the locker room at the half holding a 41-31 lead backed by Reed\u2019s 16 points and Dilione\u2019s 13. Reed looked like he was on pace for setting a new career-high if he and the Nittany Lions could keep running an offensive clinic in the second half.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHaving them both as role models and leaders beside me, it\u2019s really good playing with them,\u201d Mingo said about his teammates. \u201cEspecially when both of them are playing very well and scoring the ball at a high clip.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Minnesota again got the scoring started to kick off the second half after a Tyson pull-up jumper, but Dilione responded back and kept the lead right where it was. The Golden Gophers\u2019 leading scorer went up to 11 points on the day after that bucket.</p>\n                <p>Stewart had a nice finish with contact to make his bucket an and-one as Penn State made its lead 10 points again, but Minnesota\u2019s rebound leader, Jaylen Crocker-Johnson matched the score after being held to just four points in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota was really carving away at the Nittany Lion lead with a big-time slam from Langston Reynolds and an Isaac Asuma three-pointer that cut his squad\u2019s deficit to 50-42.</p>\n                <p>Eli Rice took a big hit to the head after another Reynolds bucket and had to exit the game and go to the locker room, questionable to return.</p>\n                <p>After losing Rice, Penn State was losing its lead too.</p>\n                <p>A Grayson Grove jam meant the Golden Gophers were stepping on the heels of the Nittany Lions, cutting the lead to just 55-53. Some chippiness followed, but the blue and white were holding onto its lead for the time being.</p>\n                <p>Mingo\u2019s first three-pointer of the day couldn\u2019t have come at a better time as his effort gave Penn State a little more wiggle room, with a narrow 63-58 lead with just about eight minutes left to play.</p>\n                <p>An unsuccessful Minnesota coach\u2019s challenge regarding a block that followed gave the Nittany Lions even more wiggle room as they got the ball back and capitalized with an easy Stewart bucket.</p>\n                <p>Reed moved just one point away from his career-high mark of 19 after a fadeaway bucket which extended the blue and white lead to 71-61 with three minutes left to play.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back scores from Dilione and Mingo made it a 75-72 ballgame with 40 seconds left in the game after Minnesota was breathing down Penn State\u2019s neck, going on a 9-0 scoring run to erase its deficit and get closer to stealing a win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was pissed at the way we were handling pressure,\u201d Rhoades said about Minnesota closing in. \u201cWe were fatigued. We were tired. We were really slow throwing it inbounds.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A Reynolds layup off the fast break gave the Golden Gophers a 76-75 lead with 30 seconds left on the clock for their first lead since the beginning of the game, but a foul took away the score, and Reynolds instead shot two from the free throw, making just one to turn it into a 75-75 game.</p>\n                <p>On the last possession of the game, Mingo fought his way to the hoop for an improbable bucket with just a second left on the clock to seal the deal and escape with the 77-75 victory.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Tibor Mirti\u010d, who has been dealing with a knee injury, was listed as \u201cout\u201d against Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTibor came back from his knee and, in practice, hurt his shoulder his first day back,\u201d Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Big men Ivan Juri\u0107 and Sa\u0161a Ciani were both listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d with undisclosed injuries entering Sunday\u2019s match and did not see any action.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSa\u0161a hurt his ankle,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIvan was sick as a dog this morning.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday when it heads to Ann Arbor to take on No. 3 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>The Wolverines won their last matchup with the Nittany Lions in the Bryce Jordan Center at the beginning of January, squeaking out a 74-72 victory.</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The last time the Nittany Lions were on the field, it was at Gillette Stadium playing for a chance at the National Championship game. They fell in regulation time and entered a long offseason, picking up numerous recruits and building up their roster for the next opportunity to compete.</p>\n                <p>No. 7 Penn State opened its regular season play indoors at Holuba Hall as opposed to Panzer Stadium against Colgate on Sunday at noon. The blue and white, after a short road block in the second quarter, blazed to an 18-14 victory to claim victory in its first game of the season.</p>\n                <p>In a high-scoring home opener, both offensive units thrived under the bright lights of Holuba Hall. A collateral of the damage made by the attackers was a tough start to the season for all three goaltenders who saw action.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHere in Holuba, the sight line is by far the most challenging, so I think that the goalies get it the worst,\u201d coach Jeff Tambroni said. \u201cThe background just doesn't provide what an outdoor background will provide.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Coach Jeff Tambroni elected to try a pair of netminders between the pipes to see who\u2019d fill Jack Fracyon\u2019s cleats. True freshman Preston Hawkins originally started the game but allowed five goals while only making a single save before being replaced by redshirt freshman Hayes Schreiner, who made four saves on 14 shots.</p>\n                <p>On the opposite end of the field, Andrew Lehrman had a better showing despite the high-scoring defeat. He made 15 saves on 33 shots, stopping many dangerous opportunities along the way.</p>\n                <p>Hunter Aquino, the reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year, Kyle Lehman and Michael Faraone each scored hat-tricks in their season debuts. Aquino ended the contest with four goals and two assists, Lehman scored three and assisted on a pair and Faraone tallied three goals and an assist.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe love this group,\u201d Aquino said. \u201cWe love getting to know each other, having (Iannantuono) an unbelievable player and (Lehman) is one of the best attackmen in the country.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Aquino, formerly a midfielder last season, moved up to the attack position as Matt Traynor was drafted by the New York Atlas of the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL). His first game up front appeared to make no difference to his ability to put points on the board.</p>\n                <p>Luke Walstrum and Patrick Carragher also had breakout performances, each scoring a pair of goals to shake up the usual gameplan of utilizing Aquino\u2019s lethal shot. They were backed up by four different scorers who added additional attacking depth \u2014 Andrew Beard, Jack Iannantuono, Ryan DiRocco and Chase Robertson.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe don't have one single guy that can't get it done,\u201d Aquino said. \u201cSo we put faith in them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Casey Quinson was Colgate\u2019s leading scorer with a hat trick of his own. He was followed by Hunter Drouin, Freddy Fowler and Quinn Spillett, each with a pair. The Raiders also had five other players add their names to the scoreboard.</p>\n                <p>Penn State dominated on the face-off dot, winning 24-11. Tambroni ran a two-player system, utilizing both Colby Baldwin and Reid Gills to win the majority of battles over Fischer Burke and Kyle Rummel. Aquino appeared once on the dot and won his single opportunity.</p>\n                <p>\u201cColby, Reid and their wings have done an exceptional job thus far,\u201d Tambroni said. \u201cIt's what we'd hoped and expected going into the game, not in any disrespect to Colgate, but they've just come in and worked so hard every day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Early in the second quarter, Colgate surged on both sides of the ball, resulting in its first lead of the game after a five-goal swing. Spillett got the Raiders in motion with a bounce shot that evaded Hawkins\u2019 stick.</p>\n                <p>Then, after Lehrman made a save on Aquino\u2019s dangerous chance, no Nittany Lion defender slid to Andy Croddick as he freely scored to take a 4-3 lead. On the next possession, Fowler compounded Penn State\u2019s woes with a side-arm shot to extend the gap to two.</p>\n                <p>This was when Tambroni put Schreiner in the cage and the switch appeared to spark Penn State to life. The move kick-started a four-goal swing that resulted in the Nittany Lions maintaining a healthy lead through the remainder of the game.</p>\n                <p>Once Penn State regained its prior three-goal advantage in the third quarter, 12-9, it didn\u2019t drop below that threshold despite consistent pressure from Colgate\u2019s attack and 10-man ride strategy.</p>\n                <p>A series of timeouts called by both teams slowed the pace of play considerably late in the fourth quarter as the Raiders attempted to mount a comeback. However, Penn State held on for the 18-14 victory.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to Panzer Stadium to face Villanova at 1 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Attackman Liam Matthews wasn\u2019t dressed for the game, although he was seen alongside his teammates on the sidelines.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Fink breaks scoring drought, nets two goals for No. 5 Penn State men's hockey at Beaver Stadium",
    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Aiden Fink was named Penn State\u2019s MVP last season, and for good reason. The shifty forward led the Nittany Lions with 53 points, 30 goals and 23 assists.</p>\n                <p>That scoring production had evaded Fink, who\u2019s missed seven games due to injury this season, for the better part of the 2025-26 campaign. But even after Fink\u2019s scoring drought extended to seven games in No. 5 Penn State\u2019s 6-3 loss to No. 2 Michigan State on Friday, coach Guy Gadowsky remained unbothered.</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky said Fink had actually played \u201cvery well\u201d in several areas and that he had no doubt his offensive production would return. Fink made good on his coach\u2019s confidence, netting two goals in the Nittany Lions\u2019 5-4 overtime loss to the Spartans on Saturday at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought it was great,\u201d Fink said of scoring his first Big Ten goal of the season. \u201cIt's just good to be back from injury \u2026 It was very cool scoring in that environment.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Michigan State earned a 17-10 edge in shots on goal to take a 1-0 lead into the first intermission. Penn State\u2019s offense craved a spark, which Fink delivered 13 seconds into the second period.</p>\n                <p>The Nashville Predators prospect dribbled down the far boards before utilizing a nifty hesitation move to blow past an off-balance Spartans defender. Fink skated into space and wristed one far side to send Beaver Stadium into a madhouse.</p>\n                <p>Who else, but Aiden Fink!! \ud83d\ude24<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAre?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeAre</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HockeyValley?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HockeyValley</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FpFPD92wZZ\">pic.twitter.com/FpFPD92wZZ</a>&mdash; Penn State Men\u2019s Hockey (@PennStateMHKY) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennStateMHKY/status/2017680011508019320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 31, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>It marked Penn State\u2019s first-ever goal at Beaver Stadium. But more importantly, it marked a breakthrough moment for the junior forward, who scored his first goal since Jan. 4.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSeeing that whole stadium packed, skating out to that blue line (during player introductions), it was the coolest moment ever,\u201d Fink said.</p>\n                <p>Fink wasn\u2019t done there. With the contest tied 2-2 toward the end of the second period, Gavin McKenna dribbled behind Michigan State\u2019s goal, eyeing his third point of the game.</p>\n                <p>Like the duo did 16 minutes earlier, McKenna fed Fink, this time with time and space in the slot. And the veteran forward converted, one-timing a snap shot past Trey Augustine\u2019s outstretched glove to give Penn State a 3-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>72 \u27a1\ufe0f 18 \u27a1\ufe0f GOAL<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAre?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeAre</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HockeyValley?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HockeyValley</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iiNBqBT1Zr\">pic.twitter.com/iiNBqBT1Zr</a>&mdash; Penn State Men\u2019s Hockey (@PennStateMHKY) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennStateMHKY/status/2017688402720612835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 31, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>\u201c(Fink) is a very smart player. You want to get the puck on his stick,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cHe can obviously put the puck in the back of the net, and he can skate like the wind. So whenever I can get the puck to him, if I ever see him open, I know something's going to happen, and I always have to be ready for a play he's going to make.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State later fell in overtime, their fourth loss in four tries against Michigan State this season. In front of 74,575 raucous fans, it was a demoralizing defeat for a team that had come so close to earning a signature victory.</p>\n                <p>But the team\u2019s 2024-25 MVP, who\u2019s battled through injury and tough bounces for much of this season, finally found his stride. And for that, Gadowsky left Beaver Stadium with something.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSince (Fink) came back from a broken thumb, he's done so much for the team,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe's back-checked, he\u2019s been so supportive of his teammates. I love seeing him have offensive success right now, because I know he's not focused on that. He's focused on trying to get this team to win as much as he can. And it's really showing through. He's as good a leader as I've ever seen him be.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Steven Pavelka | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State senior defenseman Kendall Butze stepped up big Saturday, assisting on two goals in the blue and white\u2019s 5\u20132 win over Robert Morris. With the first helper, Butze set the program record for most points for a defenseman (85).</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Butze)\u2019s an amazing player and also an amazing person, so everyone was so happy when she got it, I wouldn't want anyone else to get it,\u201d Forward Mya Vaslet said postgame. \u201cObviously, she's leaving her jersey in a better place than when she found it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Cleveland, Ohio, native got her first assist late in the second period to help freshman defenseman Danica Maynard score and put Penn State up by two points. She got her second assist in the third period when senior forward Katelyn Roberts scored the game-sealing 5th goal in the evening.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe's honestly a great role model, especially on the defensive side. She communicates a lot, and she's always positive on the bench,\u201d Maynard said postgame. \u201cShe's a two-way player, so being able to get her points and the stuff that she does, but also defend, I think she's just like an all-around player, and super fun to watch.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Nicole Hall, Tessa Janecke, and Matilde Fantin being in Italy for the Olympics, Penn State needed someone to step up, and that is exactly what Butze did against the Colonials after the team started with a 2-0 deficit.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can always rely on her for any situation,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cLike a five on three and we're penalty kill, or if it's a six on five and we are down one and we need an extra player on, we'll put her on. She's a very 200-foot player; she's someone who you can rely on all the time.\u201d\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite the slow start to the game, Penn State eventually found its stride and hit the ground running, with that unbenign beginning to the game becoming a nonfactor.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI do think their mindset was good,\u201d Coach Jeff Kampersal said,\u201d things like work against us. But again, this group. I don't worry about it all.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Kampersal continued to praise his players' preparedness and their willingness to do whatever it takes to win. He also credited the depth of the team, a season-long sentiment, saying that they have a lot of players who are able to fill in and do a lot of things well.</p>\n                <p>Butze continues to impress down the stretch, as she had her best game of the season a week earlier against Delaware, in which she had three assists and scored a goal. She is on track to score a personal record for most points in a season, beating the 27 she had in the 2024-2025 season.</p>\n                <p>With the postseason quickly approaching and a milestone-filled regular season coming to an end, the white and blue will continue to lean on their veteran leadership to win games. Butze will continue to be a key contributor as the team faces tougher opponents and her teammates need someone to rely on.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State\u2019s final series against Robert Morris not only included the first outdoor hockey game at Beaver Stadium, but the first series without three forwards who have been excelling this season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions quickly trailed 2-0 in Game 2 against the Colonials. This was a deficit seemingly uncommon for Penn State, and one that some would think an intermission speech could quickly solve. However, it wasn\u2019t a speech that mounted a comeback; it was belief inside the team that led to five unanswered goals and a 5-2 victory.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis group can self-motivate. They know when they\u2019re doing well,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said. \u201cThey know when they need to pick it up also.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The blue and white showed its self-belief every second after letting up the early goal in the second period. With continuous communication throughout the lines and aggressive forechecking, the Nittany Lions were able to develop scoring opportunities.</p>\n                <p>Mya Vaslet was a part of the surge of offense as she recorded two assists in the game. The graduate student knew that it only took one goal to get the ball rolling.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo one really has to say anything with this group, it\u2019s kind of like let\u2019s go out there and let\u2019s pick it up,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cIt\u2019s always like let\u2019s have a good response and then obviously Grace Outwater had a nice goal and kind of got everyone going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State was able to cap off a historic weekend with a comeback win without Tessa Janecke, Nicole Hall and Matilde Fantin. The three forwards are currently in Milan, Italy for the Winter Olympic Games. Thus leaving Kampersal to adjust his starting lines.</p>\n                <p>Throughout the season, the Nittany Lions have played games without either one of the three players. However, losing all three at once could leave a larger impact heading into the backend of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEvery single person in the lineup can play, and they are all good at something. Everybody can contribute,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cIf we are down one, two or three (players) we\u2019re good. Obviously, we want everybody back, and we can handle maybe a longer run in the playoffs with everybody back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions played with only three lines instead of four due to the absence of the forwards. A potential factor that could lead to tired skaters on the ice. However, signs of any effect have only been in the right direction thus far.</p>\n                <p>Kampersal\u2019s statement rings true, not only throughout the coaching staff, but the players as well. For Danica Maynard, she believes that the team\u2019s culture is what has been driving them in the last couple of games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more of the culture within our team. I think everyone knows we have to keep battling and keep playing our game,\u201d Maynard said. \u201cObviously, with the three that are gone, they\u2019re amazing, but we have a tight-knit group within as well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Fisher | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Stars shine brightest on the biggest stages. For Penn State forward Gavin McKenna, there hasn\u2019t been a more important game in his short Nittany Lions tenure than Saturday\u2019s outdoor matchup at Beaver Stadium in front of 74,575 fans.</p>\n                <p>No. 5 Penn State against No. 2 Michigan State in an event hyped up to the extreme for the past five months. Well, that was just McKenna\u2019s cup of tea. The freshman phenom took center spotlight, like he usually does, on Saturday, and nearly willed the Nittany Lions to a win.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately for Penn State, his three-point, two-goal, one-assist effort came up too small against the Spartans. Regardless, he made a statement \u2014 he\u2019s going to show up when the lights are the brightest.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI mean, every game, you want to be at your best,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cIt was obviously a big game. A lot of eyes (were) on this game and I thought our team played well. Obviously not the result we wanted. I thought it was a great experience.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McKenna is no stranger to taking his game to the next level when his team needs him the most. In last season\u2019s WHL playoffs with the Medicine Hat Tigers, he posted 38 points, nine goals and 29 assists. While the numbers look great by themself, they really catch eyes when seen that he did that in only 16 games.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s a 2.375 points-per-game pace in a physical, have-to-have-it style of hockey.</p>\n                <p>But what might be more impressive is his attitude. Guy Gadowsky said that McKenna is a for-the-team player, which says levels about the actual person he is.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s no secret McKenna is getting paid big bucks to play at Penn State. It\u2019s also no secret he\u2019s likely one-and-done and into the NHL next year as the likely No. 1 overall pick.</p>\n                <p>Yet, he\u2019s not cocky or arrogant. He genuinely wants to help the team succeed.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWell, I tell you what, there's so much that very justifiably is recognized and written about his talent, and it should be, because it's incredible,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHowever, the more I get to be around Gavin, the thing that I love the most is he is so for this team and I can tell you, he loves being on Penn State campus. He loves being a part of this, and he wants very badly to be a part of it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Saturday showed just how much he\u2019s actually bought into Penn State. McKenna said he blacked out after his goal in the second period, and during it, he showed about as much emotion as he ever has while donning the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>He said he realized how special and amazing the game was going to be while walking through the tunnel and fist-bumping Penn State football players as he made his way towards the ice. He was truly bought into the moment and the opportunity at hand.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's been pretty unbelievable,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI'll forever be grateful for what we got here at Penn State. Yeah, this game, it was special. The amount of effort people put into this game for us, people traveling in to come watch us play, it was special. And, yeah, to just be part of this community at Penn State, I'm forever at Penn Stater, and that was an amazing time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Despite a heartbreaking overtime loss to No. 2 Michigan State on Saturday, Penn State captain Dane Dowiak left the Beaver Stadium field, turned ice rink, with a belief: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t be prouder to be a Penn Stater.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The sports culture the blue and white have developed is first-class, and when 74,575 fans showed up in 15-degree weather for the first-ever outdoor hockey game at Beaver Stadium, that sentiment was all the more evident.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to feel negative because of the loss, because this was such an amazing experience,\u201d Guy Gadowsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s so incredible to be a part of an institution that supports something like this so well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Penn State community has rallied around the production of this event for months, and on Saturday, it officially became the second-highest attended outdoor college hockey game of all time, and put it among the top 10 highest attended hockey games at any level.</p>\n                <p>The electric atmosphere was evident from the moment the Nittany Lions made their entrance out of the student section gates to a roaring crowd and a tunnel of fellow Penn State athletes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWalking through those gates was pretty special,\u201d star freshman Gavin McKenna said. \u201cWalking through (all the athletes), fist-bumping them all, the crowd, it was amazing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Spartans managed to subdue the crowd less than three minutes in when forward Daniel Russell opened the scoring, but the passion never went away.</p>\n                <p>The spark in Beaver Stadium was reignited when, less than 15 seconds into the second period, forward Aiden Fink skated around a defender and rang a shot off the top crossbar and past goaltender Trey Augustine.</p>\n                <p>The lead was quickly taken back by the Spartans, however, after Charlie Stramel fired home a rebound out in front of Penn State\u2019s netminder Kevin Reidler.</p>\n                <p>Despite the quick goal by Michigan State, the blue and white maintained most of the momentum, backed by the raucous Roar Zone, and were rewarded for it less than five minutes later.</p>\n                <p>McKenna received a centering pass from Mac Gadowsky and sent the shot into the back of the Spartans' net, jumping into the glass and blowing the metaphorical roof off the stadium.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI kind of blacked out on that one,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI think just the emotions in that game, obviously with the crowd, the atmosphere, how tight of a game it was, it was pretty easy to get excited like that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Two more goals were exchanged \u2014 one from Fink and one from Stramel \u2014 to send the Nittany Lions into the final period locked in a 3-3 battle.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Shea Van Olm was the hero in Hockey Valley, with a highlight reel goal just four minutes into the third frame. After stripping the puck from a Spartan and beating another in a foot race, the forward sent a shot to the top corner of Augustine\u2019s net and gave Penn State its first lead of the day.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white had all of three minutes to enjoy its lead, before Matt Basgall\u2019s shot from the point made its way through traffic and into Reidler\u2019s net.</p>\n                <p>Neither team found another score through the final 10 minutes of the period, and Beaver Stadium and all of its 75,000 fans were sent to overtime.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like Beaver Stadium, like I know that now,\u201d Dowiak said. \u201cThat was the coolest environment I\u2019ll ever play in my life, no matter if I make the NHL or not.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite the deafening stadium and some good chances, the blue and white fell to the Spartans 5-4 about three minutes into the overtime period, when Stramel\u2019s game-winning goal completed his hat-trick and collected the weekend sweep.</p>\n                <p>While a series sweep always stings, the Penn State community gave plenty of reason for Guy Gadowsky\u2019s unit to walk away with gratitude.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNone of us, the players especially, will ever forget this experience,\u201d Guy Gadowsky said. \u201cIt was incredible, and Penn State is incredible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey returned to Pegula Ice Arena at 6 p.m. Saturday to close a two-game series against Robert Morris following the program\u2019s first victory at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions battled back from an early two-goal deficit with five unanswered goals to secure the Winter Weekend sweep over the Colonials with a final score of 5-2. The blue and white improved to 26-4 on the season, 18-1 in the AHA.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe start wasn't ideal,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said. \u201cWe're definitely ready to play, but we gifted two goals there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>First period</p>\n                <p>Penn State faced early disciplinary action in the first period as Leah Stecker was called for cross checking and Abby Stonehouse was caught for a delay of game penalty, giving the Colonials a 5-on-3 advantage. During the penalty kill, Robert Morris\u2019 Taylor Storey took a trip to the sin bin for hooking.</p>\n                <p>Once the teams were settled at even-strength, Storey took little time to get the Colonials on the board.</p>\n                <p>Sophie Morrow mishandled a pass on her attacking blue line and gave Storey a breakaway on goaltender Katie DeSa. Storey toe-dragged on her forehand and lifted the puck over DeSa\u2019s shoulder into the top right corner of the net to open the scoring exactly ten minutes into the first period.</p>\n                <p>The teams once again traded opportunities on the power play. Both McKenna Walsh and Mya Kearns took tripping minors, but both penalties were routinely cleared by the special teams units. Later, a five-minute major was assessed to Linnea Misner for checking from behind.</p>\n                <p>While on the power play, Danica Maynard put a shot on net that Grace Outwater followed up by crashing the net. Although the puck slid past goaltender Maggie Hatch and passed the goal line, the officials blew their whistles before it crossed and later deemed it a no-goal.</p>\n                <p>Second period</p>\n                <p>Rowyn Ringor wasted no time increasing the gap, despite being shorthanded. She maneuvered into the slot and ripped a wrist shot off the iron and into the back of the net to take a 2-0 lead only 14 seconds into the second period.</p>\n                <p>Outwater responded 19 seconds later. The Picton, Ontario, native blazed down the right side boards and chose to shoot short-side. Her shot landed under Hatch\u2019s glove and squeaked past the goal line to bring Penn State within one.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was hugely important that we scored right away, and that kickstarted us into motion,\u201d Kampersal said.</p>\n                <p>Stonehouse continued the scoring surge just over two-and-a-half minutes into the frame from the same spot as Outwater. She shot cross-body into the hole over Hatch\u2019s blocker-side shoulder to tie the game at 2-2.</p>\n                <p>Walsh, who scored the game-winning goal at Beaver Stadium, scored the blue and white\u2019s third unanswered goal with 10:56 remaining in the second period to take a 3-2 lead. She won the race to a breakaway before making a swift move to her backhand, sliding the puck past Hatch\u2019s extended skate.</p>\n                <p>Maynard joined the scoring after performing a spin move in the slot to get into position for a wrist shot that found a way past Hatch\u2019s pad. Penn State went into the second intermission up by a pair of goals.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen I got in there, I knew that (Mya Vaslet) was in front and she was screaming, so I threw it to the net and it got in,\u201d Maynard said.</p>\n                <p>Kendall Butze was awarded the primary assist on Maynard\u2019s goal, her 85th career point, which officially set the program record for most career points by a defenseman. The senior already holds the program record for most assists by a defenseman with 71.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEveryone was so happy when (Butze) got it,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cI wouldn't want anyone else to get it. And she's leaving her jersey in a better place than when she found it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Third period</p>\n                <p>Leah Stecker was given a five-minute major for cross checking with 16:28 remaining in the game, after a lengthy video review. Although the Colonials struck the crossbar, Penn State emerged without conceding.</p>\n                <p>Katelyn Roberts brought energy back to Pegula Ice Arena after an extended period of back-and-forth play through the neutral zone. Butze fired a shot that trickled through Hatch\u2019s pads \u2014 and while it sat on the goal-line \u2014 Roberts lurked nearby to tap the puck in.</p>\n                <p>Hatch was subsequently replaced in-net by sophomore Lucy Phillips. The new netminder was quickly thrust into action as Catriona Crarer was assessed a game misconduct for head contact.</p>\n                <p>Then, Kaitlyn Schooley took a slashing minor, allowing Penn State to close the remainder of the game on the power play.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State is set to face Lindenwood in Maryland Heights, Missouri, at 5 p.m. Friday and 2 p.m. Saturday.</p>",

    "description": "<p>When Guy Gadowsky took over as head coach of Penn State men\u2019s hockey, the program was housed in the lowly Greenberg Ice Pavilion. A complex that resembles a community rink with a ceiling lower than most of the classrooms at University Park. Yet from the moment he got the job, Gadowsky strived for bigger surroundings.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think the day I got hired, the question was \u2018when are you guys gonna play a hockey game at Beaver Stadium?\u2019\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was possible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the program grew, so did the stages they played in. From the Greenberg to the Pegula Ice Arena, to NHL arenas for specialty games and the Frozen Four, all leading up to Saturday afternoon. 74,575 fans packed into Beaver Stadium, all clad in blue and white, supporting a program that hadn\u2019t joined the NCAA until 15 years ago.</p>\n                <p>Days before the game, Gadowsky couldn\u2019t yet imagine what the scene would look like in front of a sea of hockey fans.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is going to be new, and it\u2019s certainly going to feel new,\u201d Gadowsky said prior to the game. \u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s going to be cold on the bench.\u201d</p>\n                <p>When Gadowsky first visited the stadium on Wednesday, the gratitude finally sank in. The coach reflected on a decade and a half of success, fronted by Terry Pegula and his place in the program into perspective.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to everyone who started this program and everyone who\u2019s gotten success,\" Gadowsky said. \u201cI don\u2019t think (Pegula) ever thought it\u2019d hit 75,000, but I know he\u2019s very proud.\u201d</p>\n                <p>When the weekend finally came, Gadowsky led his squad in front of a crowd that had only been topped once in the history of college hockey. They walked through the hallowed gates that have become synonymous with fall nights in Pennsylvania as fireworks shot out hundreds of feet above their skates. The stadium shook as the crowd, who weren\u2019t stuck in traffic, made up for the noise of the late arrivals.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like Beaver Stadium, and I know that now,\u201d Penn State captain Dane Dowiak said. \u201cThat was the coolest environment I will ever play in in my life, no matter if I make the NHL or not.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the players made their slow walk into frigid temperatures, representatives of other NCAA teams lined the entryway to greet them. When they lined up for the player introductions, it became clear the Roar Zone had traveled well on its journey across Curtin Road. Every time a Spartan\u2019s name was mentioned, half of the stadium overpowered the PA system with the word \u201cSUCKS\u201d louder than the 1/12th capacity of Pegula Ice Arena could scientifically muster.</p>\n                <p>Then the Nittany Lions got their chance to be introduced, creating a lifetime memory as the crowd roared at each name and picture on the jumbotrons.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust seeing that whole stadium packed, skating out to the blue line with your name called, it was the coolest moment ever.\u201d Aiden Fink said.</p>\n                <p>The loudest ovation came for McKenna. If there\u2019s one player in the NCAA who could imagine playing in a game more grandiose than Saturday, it\u2019s him. The expected first-overall NHL draft pick now has a memory that will be hard to top without involving a Stanley Cup over his head. McKenna expressed what being a Nittany Lion means to him after a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ll forever be grateful for what we\u2019ve got here at Penn State,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cThis game was special; I\u2019m forever a Penn Stater.\u201d</p>\n                <p>When the game started, the crowd stayed hot, singing the classic Penn State hockey chants and the football traditions that are commonplace at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>Even though the Spartans silenced the energy in the first with a goal, the energy that returned when Fink potted the Nittany Lions\u2019 first goal nearly brought down the west stadium construction site. As fireworks shot off, Fink was dogpiled by teammates while over 70,000 fans jumped and sang along to Kernkraft.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was one of those moments where you just look around and take it in,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it was for hockey, it\u2019s very humbling, honestly.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After the game, despite the loss, Gadowsky couldn\u2019t help but reflect on the experience with gratitude. He took the football coach's seat in the Beaver Stadium press room, holding back tears as he thanked everyone involved with making his dream for the program come true.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was bigger and more vast than I imagined,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI just never thought I would be able to be on a hockey rink in that kind of environment; it exceeded what I had in mind.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the press conference came to an end, singalong the end of Gadowsky\u2019s day at the center of the hockey world and seated in the largest venue the state of Pennsylvania had to offer, the coach was pondered as to if he thinks stadium hockey will return to Penn State. He credited all the university officials under him and offered his support for running it back next year.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat\u2019s way above my pay grade,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI would love to do it as that was as amazing of a hockey experience as I ever had.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "No. 14 Penn State men's volleyball falls to No. 3 Hawai'i in four-set battle",
    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>If you ever find yourself a member of a Penn State sports team that uses a ball and you\u2019re playing inside Rec Hall in 2026, chances are it's already an uphill battle, and you\u2019re losing.</p>\n                <p>Both basketball squads are winless at the venue in 2026, with some poor results in that stretch. These disappointing results create a reality in which the only sports to win their last home outings at the oldest venue on campus were both gymnastics squads.</p>\n                <p>Yet, the men\u2019s volleyball team, in its final season under Mark Pavlik\u2019s over three decades at the helm, started well on its crusade to change such a narrative, with four straight Rec Hall wins to start the season.</p>\n                <p>After a disastrous Midwest road trip, in which McKendree snapped the Nittany Lions' win streak with a two-match sweep where the blue and white only snagged a single set, the haunting at Rec Hall continued for Penn State athletics.</p>\n                <p>In a particularly chilly and sporting-packed weekend in State College, Pavlik\u2019s squad welcomed a daunting foe in the form of No.3 Hawai\u2019i. In match one, the Rainbow Warriors swept the Nittany Lions decisively.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white kept it close throughout the first two sets, yet a ten-point third set differential sent them packing with a chance for redemption in the second outing \u2013 and just like the first, early starts favored Penn State.</p>\n                <p>That doesn\u2019t mean it went all smoothly for the blue and white. A unit of Jaxon Herr, Ryan Merk, Jaidyn Bethel, Gaige Gabriel, Sean Harvey, Owen Rose and Matthew Luoma started for Penn State, and despite early leads, Hawai\u2019i clawed back and even took the upper hand at times.</p>\n                <p>Back-and-forth action marked the remainder of the frame until a tied 25 score saw action intensify and clean up, with the all-important first set on the line. Pavlik brought Gabriel back onto the floor.</p>\n                <p>However, it wasn\u2019t the 6-foot-8 sophomore deciding the action this time, as he so often has this season; stalwart starter Rose logged two crucial aces to determine the set in the Nittany Lions' favor.</p>\n                <p>With the drama and momentum at a high, the Nittany Lions buckled into the driver\u2019s seat for an opportunity to mount an upset over its island foe, yet instead, Hawai\u2019i immediately drowned out that effort.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s not fair to say if the Nittany Lions crashed and burned in that set from behind the wheel, but what is more reasonable is that the Rainbow Warriors may have committed grand theft auto on all momentum behind their four aces en route to a 25-10 smashing.</p>\n                <p>From there, the blue and white were only visible from the rearview, as Hawai\u2019i rainbowed their score with huge scoring runs, which had no pots of gold at the end of it for Penn State. The Rainbow Warriors snatched the first three points of the third set, via a kill and a pair of Nittany Lions\u2019 attack errors.</p>\n                <p>At the midpoint of the set, Hawai\u2019i led 12-6 and continued to easily swerve past anything that Pavlik\u2019s unit threw at them. The Nittany Lions attempted to draw back into it, swapping kills with the Rainbow Warriors. That effort was to no avail, however, as by the time Penn State reached 12, its foe had 20.</p>\n                <p>Bending into the final corner, Hawai\u2019i notched a pair of kills, a point off an error, and an ace to claw closer to victory, and despite a last-minute effort, the blue and white again conceded a set, this time 25-15.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white trudged out for what appeared to be the final set, and the numbers at the time were discouraging. Hawai\u2019i posted a hitting percentage over four times higher, and led in every single statistical category except digs, which entered the fourth set tied at 20.</p>\n                <p>The back-and-forth nature of the play returned, however, with the win on the line for Hawai\u2019i, as both units traded kills. Penn State seized the leveled momentum with savvy setups and thundering kills to claw back into the set, and the two squads knotted at 12 points.</p>\n                <p>Hawai\u2019i showcased its talent on an individual level, getting up to eight aces on the day, and unreal sequences continued to keep this one level. Bethel put it all on the line for Penn State, elevating above the net and even taking a hit off his face, although it didn\u2019t save a point, and the redshirt freshman exited soon after with a tweaked ankle.</p>\n                <p>The fight for points and pandemonium resumed, with the teams extending into extra points, which let the lid off the Rec Hall crowd. The blue and white navigated to set point via an attack error, yet the two teams couldn\u2019t pull away as the score ticked higher and into the 30s.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions had match point and attempted to ice the server with a timeout, but the sequence eventually ended in what would\u2019ve been the set-winning point, as the official initially ruled, an interesting call, as the replay showed the ball well inside the line.</p>\n                <p>Luoma committed an error on the attack, and Hawai\u2019s Adrien Roure smashed the game-winning ace, putting the exclamation point on a 38 to 36 set.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State remains at Rec Hall with an opportunity to get back into the win column with a pair of matches against Saint Francis. The first will be the Nittany Lions\u2019 THON Match at 7 p.m. on Friday, Feb 6.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "No. 5 Penn State men's hockey falls in overtime to No. 2 Michigan State in first game at Beaver Stadium",
    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. \u2013 A top-five conference matchup is exciting as it is, but take it outside in front of a sea of 70,000 fans decked in white in one of the most storied stadiums in the country, and you have a game for the history books.</p>\n                <p>No. 5 Penn State took the ice \u2014 previously the field \u2014 in single-digit, real-feel temperatures for the first-ever outdoor hockey game at Beaver Stadium on Saturday, taking on No. 2 Michigan State in the second meeting of the two-game series.</p>\n                <p>A back-and-forth battle into overtime saw Michigan State secure the sweep with a 5-4 win.</p>\n                <p>The atmosphere at Beaver Stadium was electric from the start, with the Nittany Lions mimicking the classic Penn State football entrance from the tunnel to a chanting and packed student section.</p>\n                <p>The energy from the crowd was quickly stifled, however, when Michigan State struck first less than three minutes into play. A pass from forward Charlie Stramel across the slot found Daniel Russell, who fired a shot past an outstretched Kevin Reidler to give the Spartans an early lead.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State maintained most of the momentum through the next few minutes and was given an early chance to extend its lead when Penn State freshman Lev Katzin was called for the game\u2019s first penalty.</p>\n                <p>Nothing came of the opportunity, however, and the blue and white got its own turn on the man-advantage not long after. Forward Anthony Romani, coming off a hat-trick performance in Friday night's contest, went to the box for hooking with about three minutes to go in the period.</p>\n                <p>Like the Spartans\u2019 earlier opportunity, the Nittany Lions couldn\u2019t get a score. Despite several high-danger chances, star goaltender Trey Augustine showed off his First Team All-American skills and maintained Michigan State's one-goal lead heading into the first intermission.</p>\n                <p>Both Aiden Fink and Penn State found the momentum they had otherwise been lacking just seconds into the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>The former Hobey Baker top-10 finalist had just three goals through 18 games this season, factoring in an injury that sidelined him for over two months back in October.</p>\n                <p>Fink broke his scoring drought just 13 seconds into the second period, after maneuvering around a defender and firing a shot off the top crossbar to even the score.</p>\n                <p>The tie game was short-lived, however, when Stramel collected a rebound out in front of Reidler about three minutes after Fink\u2019s score to retake the lead for the Spartans.</p>\n                <p>Despite Michigan State\u2019s goal, the blue and white continued to hold most of the momentum, and Beaver Stadium could sense it.</p>\n                <p>To the roar of the crowd, star freshman Gavin McKenna found a centering pass from Mac Gadowsky and sent a shot up and over the shoulder of Augustine to tie the game near the halfway mark of the middle frame.</p>\n                <p>It was Penn State dominance for most of the remaining second period, playing with physicality and stifling any offensive momentum the Spartans previously had.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 first lead of the series came late in the middle frame, when Fink found his second of the game with a slapshot off a feed from McKenna that made the overflowing student section erupt.</p>\n                <p>Despite playing its strongest period of the series, the blue and white couldn\u2019t hold on to the lead as the clock ticked down.</p>\n                <p>A trip from Shea Van Olm gave the Spartans a late power-play opportunity, and with just two seconds on the clock, Stramel notched his second score to send the two Big Ten foes into the final 20 minutes tied at three goals apiece.</p>\n                <p>Van Olm made up for his earlier penalty, retaking the lead for the Nittany Lions just four minutes into the final period. The forward stripped the puck from Maxim \u0160trb\u00e1k and used speed to beat a defender, firing a shot to the top corner of the Spartans\u2019 net.</p>\n                <p>Once again, the team in front couldn\u2019t hold on to the lead, and Michigan State answered with a goal of its own just minutes later to even the score.</p>\n                <p>All the back-to-back action came to a halt for the final 12 minutes. Neither side could notch the go-ahead goal as the horn sounded, and Beaver Stadium was sent to overtime.</p>\n                <p>It took three minutes for Michigan State to end it and secure the sweep, after a back-and-forth overtime period.</p>\n                <p>Stramel registered a hat trick when he was left all alone in front of Reidler, and sent a shot to the top crossbar to register the 5-4 win.</p>\n                <p>More Winter Sports Weekend Coverage</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s never too early to think about next year.</p>\n                <p>Ahead of winter workouts, here\u2019s a way-too-early prediction of what Penn State\u2019s offensive depth chart will look like in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Quarterback</p>\n                <p>1. Rocco Becht, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Alex Manske, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>3. Connor Barry, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>4. Peyton Falzone, freshman</p>\n                <p>5. Kase Evans, freshman</p>\n                <p>The starting quarterback is an obvious one, as Rocco Becht transfers to Penn State after three years leading the offense at Iowa State. There\u2019s a natural fit for him in State College, following Matt Campbell, offensive coordinator Taylor Mouser and quarterbacks coach Jake Waters.</p>\n                <p>Behind Becht, there will be a competition for the backup spot between Alex Manske and Connor Barry. Manske also joins the Nittany Lions following a freshman year with the Cyclones while Barry heads to Happy Valley with one year of eligibility left after playing for Division III Christopher Newport in Virginia with a brief stint at Appalachian State beforehand.</p>\n                <p>Despite only playing in three games with limited numbers in 2025, Manske should have the edge in this battle as a former four-star recruit, who Iowa State believed was the quarterback of the future behind Becht. Barry should provide a veteran presence in the No. 3 role, coming off of a career at Christopher Newport where he\u2019s thrown for 5,561 passing yards and 55 touchdowns and most recently winning his conference\u2019s Offensive Player of the Year.</p>\n                <p>Rounding out the room are a pair of freshmen in four-star Peyton Falzone and three-star Kase Evans. Walk-on Jack Lambert is the only quarterback on roster who returns from a season ago.</p>\n                <p>Running back</p>\n                <p>1. Carson Hansen, senior</p>\n                <p>2. James Peoples, junior</p>\n                <p>3. Quinton Martin Jr., redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>4. Cam Wallace, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Iowa State transfer tailback Carson Hansen should be the starter come the season-opener against Marshall. He\u2019s coming off of a 2025 campaign where he was a second-team All-Big 12 selection, rushing for 952 yards and six touchdowns.</p>\n                <p>With that being said, this job won\u2019t be handed to Hansen, as Quinton Martin Jr. and Ohio State transfer James Peoples will more than likely be in the mix.</p>\n                <p>Last year, Peoples totaled 344 rushing yards and three touchdowns as the third Buckeyes\u2019 tailback on the depth chart behind Bo Jackson and CJ Donaldson. Martin didn\u2019t touch the ball during the regular season for Penn State, but exploded in the Pinstripe Bowl, recording 20 carries for 101 yards.</p>\n                <p>There should be a healthy dosage of all three running backs to start the year, but any of them can emerge as the lead back. However, there\u2019s a good chance that this is a running back by committee approach, with the trio all seeing some form of a role.</p>\n                <p>Cam Wallace, who has shown flashes and opted to return for 2026 despite initially entering the transfer portal, will be a key depth piece.</p>\n                <p>Wide receiver</p>\n                <p>X-receiver:</p>\n                <p>1. Chase Sowell, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>2. Peter Gonzalez, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Y-receiver:</p>\n                <p>1. Koby Howard, sophomore</p>\n                <p>2. Keith Jones Jr., redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Z-receiver:</p>\n                <p>1. Brett Eskildsen, junior</p>\n                <p>2. Lyrick Samuel, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>The starting three wideouts on-paper seem to be clear with a pair of Iowa State transfers in Chase Sowell and Brett Eskildsen as well as Koby Howard returning to Penn State for his sophomore year.</p>\n                <p>As far as where they line up on the field, that\u2019ll be up in the air. Sowell will likely be on the outside, while Eskildsen or Howard can either play on the outside or in the slot.</p>\n                <p>A season ago, Sowell totaled 32 receptions for 500 yards and two touchdowns while Eskildsen notched 30 catches for 526 yards and five touchdowns. Howard garnered seven receptions for 133 yards in Year 1 as a Nittany Lion, but received rave reviews throughout the course of the campaign.</p>\n                <p>Peter Gonzalez, Lyrick Samuel and Grambling State transfer Keith Jones Jr. should be the next group up.</p>\n                <p>Tight end</p>\n                <p>1. Andrew Rappleyea, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>2. Benjamin Brahmer, senior</p>\n                <p>3. Gabe Burkle, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>4. Finn Furmanek, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>Andrew Rappleyea and Iowa State transfer Benjamin Brahmer will be the surefire starting tight ends, making them a way-too-early contender for best tandem at the position in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Rappleyea took over as the top Penn State tight end by the end of the 2025, recording 20 catches for 180 yards and three touchdowns in the final three games of the year.

He accumulated 54 receptions for 607 yards and two scores in four years with the Cyclones.</p>\n                <p>Finn Furmanek will be a key depth piece, as the State College native saw a key role on special teams as well a year ago. Per Sean Fitz of On3, he was put on scholarship.</p>\n                <p>Offensive line</p>\n                <p>Left tackle:</p>\n                <p>Anthony Donkoh, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>Owen Aliciene, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>Left guard:</p>\n                <p>Trevor Buhr, redshirt junior</p>\n                <p>Malachi Goodman, redshirt freshman</p>\n                <p>Center:</p>\n                <p>Brock Riker, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Dom Rulli, redshirt senior</p>\n                <p>Right guard:</p>\n                <p>Cooper Cousins, junior</p>\n                <p>Goodman</p>\n                <p>Right tackle:</p>\n                <p>Garrett Sexton, redshirt sophomore</p>\n                <p>Aliciene</p>\n                <p>Anthony Donkoh is the lone starter to return from 2025, as the rest of the crew is off to the NFL draft. He started at right guard, but with him being the best player, and experience as the starter at right tackle, he could shift over to left tackle to protect Becht\u2019s blindside.</p>\n                <p>At the other tackle spot, it\u2019ll be a battle between Garrett Sexton and Owen Aliciene. Sexton was the backup right tackle to Nolan Rucci last year, while Aliciene was the third-string left tackle behind Drew Shelton and now-Florida transfer Eagan Boyer. With Sexton having one more year under his belt, he should have the upper hand in this position battle.</p>\n                <p>For guards, Cooper Cousins and Trevor Buhr should lock down the starting spots. Cousins has been a rotational piece the past two seasons, burning his redshirt in 2024 as a freshman, and starting in the Pinstripe Bowl. Buhr appeared in eight games for Iowa State last year, starting in six of them.</p>\n                <p>At center, it\u2019ll be a battle between Texas State transfer Brock Riker and walk-on-turned scholarship player Dom Rulli, who started in the Pinstripe Bowl.</p>\n                <p>Rulli has done some good things for Penn State, notably on special teams as the punt protector, but Riker started in all 12 games in 2025 and was a highly sought after player in the portal by Power Four programs. He also was also a second-team freshman All-American via The Athletic.</p>\n                <p>Malachi Goodman is a versatile piece off of the bench, who can play either guard or tackle. He came to Penn State as a tackle but practiced at guard under former position coach Phil Trautwein.</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-6, 315-pound redshirt freshman was a highly touted recruit, ranking as a high four-star, but didn\u2019t see the field his freshman year.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State is just over a week from one of its most anticipated seasons in several years under coach Kayla Treanor\u2019s first year.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions held an open viewing session for media and fans, featuring two quarters of scrimmage and one quarter of situational work.</p>\n                <p>After 45 minutes of action, here\u2019s what to expect from this year\u2019s Penn State team.</p>\n                <p>Strong attack</p>\n                <p>The White team wasted no time getting down the field after winning the opening faceoff, led by sophomore Allie Meyer. A little over one minute into the game, Meyer scored the scrimmage\u2019s first goal against starting goalie Sydney Manning.</p>\n                <p>The White team\u2019s success continued midway through the first period as fellow sophomore Ellie Wisch put her team up 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s scrimmage was a high-scoring affair through 15 minutes, with goals by Emma Kelly, Delaney Radin and Rocquette Allen.</p>\n                <p>The second period was slightly slower after four minutes, with neither side able to score. However, things got going after Allen secured her second goal of the day.</p>\n                <p>The Blue team ultimately took a commanding lead to win the scrimmage with another goal from Wisch and the first goals of the game by Maddie Greco, Erika Ho and Payton Wainman.</p>\n                <p>Clean play</p>\n                <p>It was nearly five minutes of play without any turnovers for either team. Treanor\u2019s offense was playing crisp, clean lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>While multiple passes went astray by the end of the game, the two sides combined for only a few turnovers from pressure and carelessness.</p>\n                <p>The scrimmage featured several fouls from both teams, with many players being shown the green card and taken off the field for the minute-long violation.</p>\n                <p>Team depth</p>\n                <p>Nearly every player saw the field in Friday\u2019s scrimmage, showcasing the depth of Treanor\u2019s squad this year.</p>\n                <p>That strength was on display through the opening period with the White team \u2014 played by a majority of underclassmen \u2014 leading the charge.</p>\n                <p>Two sophomores scored the opening two goals, and freshman Allen scored two of her own.</p>\n                <p>Goalkeeper questions</p>\n                <p>While Sydney Manning has been Penn State\u2019s premier goalkeeper throughout her first two seasons, starting in 26 out of 32 games, she wasn\u2019t the star on Friday.</p>\n                <p>Senior Emily Bette was the goalkeeper to watch in the team\u2019s scrimmage, recording two saves against two goals in the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>The Albany, New York, native had a hard task while defending the net against Penn State\u2019s starters. However, her second save came against Ho, the Nittany Lions\u2019 leading scorer last season.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Nebraska wrestled a visually frustrating style against the Nittany Lions. A majority of matches saw the Cornhuskers keeping their knees to the ground and backing off engagement, looking to pick a spot to potentially take down the high-powered Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The reaction from the Nittany Lions was a show of apparent frustration across multiple matches, including Mitchell Mesenbrink urging LJ Araujo to take action in his match and Levi Haines nearly shoving Christopher Minto off of the stage.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not always going to have your best night, and as a team, maybe we were a little flat,\u201d Cael Sanderson said. \u201cI think the guys had to get tough to battle some really good wrestlers.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While the upper classmen let their emotions fly, one freshman kept his composure in a low-scoring match, despite suffering the first loss of his collegiate career in controversial fashion.</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke surged up to the top three of the 157 pound weight class throughout the first part of his first season, entering his match at the Bryce Jordan Center undefeated. In his way was the defending national champion at his weight, No. 5 Antrell Taylor.</p>\n                <p>From the outset of the match, Taylor stayed low, not allowing Duke any leverage to get to his legs. Despite multiple attempts from the former U20 World Champion, Taylor was rarely in real danger due to his ability to back away from his opponent.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe see it every week, it\u2019s nothing new, but it\u2019s hard to wrestle,\u201dSanderson said. \u201cRefs don\u2019t really call stalling traditionally anymore.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The only form of engagement offered by Taylor to avoid the stall calls was rough hand fighting that was the signature of Nebraska\u2019s dual strategy. Taylor kept his hands in the face of Duke when they weren\u2019t being used to push him backwards or maintaining distance wrist control.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just jabbing us in the face and backing up, right?\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe have to be able to close the gap and do our thing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Duke did have a takedown opportunity in the first period, getting his arms around Taylor on the edge of the mat and getting off his feet momentarily, but the ruling by the referees was to not award a takedown in the moment.</p>\n                <p>Assistant coach Nick Lee threw the challenge brick on the mat, leading to a moment of confusion as the refs didn\u2019t begin the challenge until after lengthy conversations with both coaching staffs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was my call to throw the brick and we probably shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cIt was close enough that we threw, and we obviously wish we had it later on.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After multiple minutes looking at the tape, the call of no takedown stood, citing reaction time.</p>\n                <p>The NCAA rulebook in 2025-26 allows for wrestlers to have their hands or knees on the mat for a \u201csplit-second\u201d without being ruled a takedown as reaction time. However, the explicit time isn\u2019t known and has been viewed as a judgement call to the referees. Sanderson didn\u2019t take the judgement into effect before he threw the brick.</p>\n                <p>As the bout continued, Taylor stalled the rest of the way through the bout, including sudden victory. The pair went to a tiebreaker in which Taylor successfully rode Duke out for 30 seconds, awarding him the deciding second point.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Nittany Lions 26-12 victory, Nebraska\u2019s strategy in this Bryce Jordan Center dual was to slow Penn State\u2019s rampant offensive pace using stall techniques and hand fighting. Duke fell victim to the trap, taking his first collegiate loss to Taylor.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Duke) will be fine,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe\u2019ll learn from it, keep getting better and that\u2019s the name of the game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>Despite all the success Cael Sanderson has had at Penn State, one thing that recently has been a struggle to find is a consistent 125-pound wrestler.</p>\n                <p>That all changed when Sanderson secured Wyoming Seminary product, Luke Lilledahl, to provide comfortability in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust starting off a dual with some high-scoring matches, and scoring (as) many team points as I can is really fun,\u201d Lilledahl said.</p>\n                <p>In the 2020-21 season, Penn State had Robert Howard wrestle, but he lost early in the NCAA Tournament. The following year Drew Hildebrandt seemed to be the guy to break the trend, but after earning the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten Tournament, he fell early in the NCAA\u2019s, as well. Gary Steen missed the NCAA Tournament in 2023, before Braeden Davis took the spot in his true freshman season.</p>\n                <p>Davis won the Big Ten title his freshman year, but was quickly ousted at the NCAA Tournament, going 2-2 and falling out of an All-American spot.</p>\n                <p>Insert Lilledahl, who\u2019s taken the 125-pound weight class by storm. He was the top-ranked wrestler in the 2024 recruiting class, and has lived up to those expectations. In his true freshman season, he garnered a 25-3 overall record and held the No. 1 ranking at one point in the season.</p>\n                <p>He went 4-0 in Evanston, Illinois, en route to a Big Ten title, before going 6-1, ending with a pinfall victory over the previously top seed, Matt Ramos of Purdue, to earn third place in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl is now the No. 1 wrestler at the weight class in his second year, and has provided that consistency at the lightest weight, and the typical leadoff wrestler for the lineup.</p>\n                <p>He faced the easiest competitor of the entire dual on paper, taking on unranked Alan Koehler to open the Bryce Jordan Center on Friday against Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl lived up to his \u201clightning Luke\u201d nickname, defeating Koehler by tech fall after a quick takedown to start the dual off.</p>\n                <p>He was the catalyst to a quick, and hot start for the Nittany Lions. His follow up, Marcus Blaze, came out on top in a top-10 matchup and Braeden Davis came out the gates flying to begin his match.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-two punch, it\u2019s pretty much like a 10-punch knockout,\u201d Lilledhal said.</p>\n                <p>He lets his fellow No. 1-ranked wrestlers finish the job, with top-ranked Rocco Welsh sealing the deal against Nebraska. Welsh is joined by Shayne Van Ness, Mitchell Mesenbrink, Levi Haines and Josh Barr as No. 1 wrestlers in addition to Lilledahl.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat sounds pretty good,\u201d Sanderson said of his six No. 1 wrestlers. \u201cI never really thought about that. We love our lineup, we love our guys, we\u2019re just gonna keep getting better every match and be at our best.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite the four straight top-ranked wrestlers from 165 pounds to 197 pounds, it\u2019s the \u201clightning\u201d wrestler that kicks things off to really get things going.</p>\n                <p>Lilledahl has started off every dual with a victory, advancing to 14-0 on the season after his victory, and holds a 67% bonus rate, often getting Penn State started with a four or more point lead.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like a lot of times, duals may start off slow, and then they can pick up the pace, but I feel like a lot of our duals, if you\u2019re not here early, then you\u2019re gonna miss something, and I think that\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Lilledahl said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Two months ago, Penn State walked out of East Lansing, Michigan, with a 5-0 loss and almost half a game in penalty minutes. The Nittany Lions were swept by Michigan State in a series that saw over 25 total penalties and four misconducts.</p>\n                <p>The dislike between the two Big Ten foes is unmistakable, and that was no different when the No. 5 blue and white welcomed the No. 2 Spartans to Pegula Ice Arena for a rematch Friday night.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo matter how you put it, it\u2019s two top-five teams playing each other, so it\u2019s going to be physical,\u201d forward Reese Laubach said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be two teams that want to kill the other one.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A night filled with physicality ended in Michigan State\u2019s favor, besting the Nittany Lions 6-3.</p>\n                <p>The animosity picked up right where it left off, as the Spartans laid some heavy hits from the first whistle.</p>\n                <p>The first penalty happened shortly after Michigan State\u2019s first goal, when star defenseman Jackson Smith was called for interference.</p>\n                <p>The blue and whites\u2019 4th-ranked penalty kill held on, however, highlighted by Fleming\u2019s solid performance in net.</p>\n                <p>The first time tensions boiled over came with about six minutes left in the first period, after Penn State\u2019s Nic Chin-DeGraves and Michigan State\u2019s Shane Vansaghi got into it in front of Fleming\u2019s net.</p>\n                <p>A line brawl followed, and it took the refs several minutes to drag Chin-DeGraves away from the action and into the penalty box.</p>\n                <p>Chin-DeGraves was awarded two minor penalties for cross checking and unsportsmanlike conduct on top of a 10 minute misconduct, while Vansaghi was awarded a minor penalty for roughing.</p>\n                <p>The Spartans got another shot at the powerplay, with Chin-DeGraves animatedly yelling at Vansaghi across the box for the next several minutes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEmotions get high and emotions get low, and you got to find that even keel,\u201d defenseman Jarod Crespo said. \u201cBut that kid really wanted to win, and he came back and played a great game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>This time, Michigan State got one on the man-advantage after sophomore Owen West\u2019s shot from the point made it through traffic.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white got its first chance on the power play thanks to senior Daniel Russel, but the penalty was negated less than 30 seconds later, when Smith was called for his second interference of the night.</p>\n                <p>4-on-4 hockey provided no goals, but Michigan State capitalized on its short man-advantage when Cayden Lindstrom found Romani in the slot for his second score of the night.</p>\n                <p>To a resounding chorus of boo\u2019s for the officials, Penn State headed into the locker room chasing three goals after the first 20 minutes.</p>\n                <p>After Aiden Fink was caught up high and laid out at center ice by Lindstrom, freshman phenom Gavin McKenna came to the forward\u2019s defense, and both sides started trading punches.</p>\n                <p>Both McKenna and Lindstrom were given 5-minute majors and game misconducts, ending their nights, while the Spartans\u2019 Colin Ralph was given an additional 5-minute major for face masking.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou\u2019re returning two-time MVP gets popped right in the head, no, I don\u2019t mind the response at all,\u201d Coach Gadowsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see that happen to your teammate, and you just respond, and (McKenna) just responded.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite several high danger chances, the blue and white couldn\u2019t figure out how to get past first-team All-American netminder Trey Augustine on the extended power play.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white had a new life after Laubach\u2019s goal, and after successfully killing off a 5-on-3 opportunity from the Spartans, Hockey Valley could feel the energy shift.</p>\n                <p>Another Michigan State penalty gave the Nittany Lions a golden opportunity with the momentum on their side, and as time expired on the power play, Matt DiMarsico tipped in a shot from JJ Wiebusch, bringing it within one goal of a comeback.</p>\n                <p>That goal never came, however, and despite a strong final frame, two empty net goals for the Spartans sealed the Nittany Lions\u2019 6-3 loss.</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Big Ten hockey thrives on physicality. It\u2019s why Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky preaches a grit-and-grind mentality \u2014 one that ranks giving maximum effort above anything else.</p>\n                <p>Another pillar of Gadowsky\u2019s culture: Stand up for your teammates when you think it\u2019s necessary, no matter the ensuing costs.</p>\n                <p>That philosophy was tested early in the second period when Aiden Fink took a bruising hit as he exited Penn State\u2019s defensive zone. Fink skated with his head down as he eyed a loose puck before Michigan State\u2019s Cayden Lindstrom dug his shoulder into Fink\u2019s head, causing the junior forward to torpedo into the ice, where he\u2019d lie for an additional minute.</p>\n                <p>As the Pegula Ice Arena crowd roared in disgust, Fink\u2019s teammates \u2014 Gavin McKenna, Dane Dowiak and Nolan Collins \u2014 beelined toward Lindstrom. There was zero hesitation in their decision, one fully backed by their head coach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen your returning MVP (Fink) is popped right in the head, I don't mind the response at all,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cYou see that happen to your teammate, you just respond. Gavin just responded.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Collins knocked Lindstrom to the ground. Colin Ralph and Dowiak exchanged blows along the boards. McKenna threw several jabs at a Spartan skater as a mob formed alongside Penn State\u2019s bench.</p>\n                <p>After a lengthy review, Lindstrom and Ralph received five-minute major penalties and game misconducts for their involvement. Trailing 3-0, Penn State had earned a much-needed five-minute power play.</p>\n                <p>The downside: McKenna was booked for facemasking, which resulted in a five-minute major and a game misconduct. The Nittany Lions, who already faced a three-goal deficit, were now without one of their top offensive creators.</p>\n                <p>But the team didn\u2019t care. Their star player didn\u2019t hesitate to defend his teammate after a blindside hit. And for that, McKenna\u2019s teammates expressed great respect.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhoever gets hit, we're gonna stand up for him,\u201d Reese Laubach said. \u201cDoesn't matter if it\u2019s (Fink) \u2014 it could be anyone. Obviously, taking a penalty and losing Gavin sucks, but he was standing up for (his) teammate.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions went scoreless on their five-minute power play. But it awoke something in them \u2014 a renewed energy following Lindstrom\u2019s hit that sparked a spirited comeback.</p>\n                <p>First, Jackson Smith wristed one off the far post and in to make it a 3-1 game. And despite Porter Martone\u2019s tally near the end of the second period, Penn State felt it was right there.</p>\n                <p>Laubach answered Mortone\u2019s tally with a tap-in goal off a cross-ice feed from Carter Schade to make it 4-2. Minutes later, JJ Wiebusch backhanded a pass to Matt DiMarsico, who tapped in his 15th goal of the season to make it a one-score game.</p>\n                <p>The Spartans later added two empty-net goals to halt Penn State\u2019s comeback. But the Nittany Lions never quit \u2014 a perseverance that drew Gadowsky\u2019s praise.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe had a lot of chances, we didn't solve them until late, (we) hit a few posts, but I love how we came back,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI think we played a more consistent game, territorially, than the scoring would indicate \u2026 I don't think we played much differently, except the punks went in.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 1 Penn State entered the Bryce Jordan Center for its second time this season, but for its first official BJC dual of the calendar year.</p>\n                <p>The match contained a lot of confusion, but the result was in Penn State\u2019s favor, as the Nittany Lions got the 26-12 victory over No. 6 Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>125 Pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs Alan Koehler (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl was aggressive off the jump, getting the early takedown in the opening 30 seconds. After an early escape and an attempt to gain higher position, Alan Koehler couldn\u2019t stay off the ground as Lilledahl got another takedown. Lilledahl led 9-2 going into the second period.</p>\n                <p>Koehler with the early escape, Lilledahl with another slam to the mat. Lilledahl continued to go at Koehler\u2019s leg and tallied four-near fall points. The sophomore held a 14-3 lead going into the third period. Lilledahl got the tech fall 20-4.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 5-0.</p>\n                <p>133 Pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs No. 10 Jacob Van Dee (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze and Jacob Van Dee were even early in the match. Van Dee didn\u2019t give Blaze any space, but didn\u2019t do any attacking. Blaze got a hold of Van Dee and got the only takedown of the period.</p>\n                <p>There wasn\u2019t much action in the middle period, which continued into the final frame. Blaze got the victory, 5-1.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 8-0.</p>\n                <p>141 Pounds: No. 12 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs No. 4 Brock Hardy (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis didn\u2019t waste any time, as he took Brock Hardy down immediately. Davis got another takedown right after Hardy got up, controlling the first period with a 6-2 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Davis got the escape, not allowing Hardy to attack, allowing his defense to protect himself. Hardy then got his first takedown of the match, leading Davis 7-5.</p>\n                <p>Hardy escaped early in the third, cutting the deficit to one. At the end of the match, Hardy tapped Davis\u2019s chest, where Davis then tried to trip him.</p>\n                <p>The two had some words after the match, resulting in a penalty point deducted from Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 7-6.</p>\n                <p>149 Pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs No. 18 Chance Lamer (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Chance Lamer got the first takedown of the match. Van Ness did escape, but Lamer seemed to be the quicker wrestler. Lamer led 3-1.</p>\n                <p>After a quick escape in the second period by Lamer, Van Ness tied the match with a takedown.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness escaped and got another takedown to take the 8-4 lead. Once Lamer was down, it took him a while to get back up. Van Ness recorded another takedown and then a 12-5 victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 10-6.</p>\n                <p>157 Pounds: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs No. 5 Antrell Taylor (NEB)</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke and Antrell Taylor was a stalemate to start. Taylor continued to drop to a knee, which prevented Duke from doing anything. Duke tried to attack, but couldn\u2019t get anything going.</p>\n                <p>Duke got what looked to be a takedown that wasn\u2019t awarded a takedown. Penn State challenged and it was confirmed to be no takedown, resulting in no score after the first.</p>\n                <p>Taylor escaped quickly taking an early lead. Taylor continued to be on both knees for most of the period. Duke escaped in the third to tie the match, as Taylor continued to avoid Duke and not engage in any offense.</p>\n                <p>Sudden victory was the same as the first three periods. Time was ticking and Duke was getting frustrated. Taylor escaped by what the Penn State fans thought was a controversial call by the refs. Duke couldn\u2019t escape and Taylor got the victory despite appearing to be stalling throughout the match.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 10-9.</p>\n                <p>165 Pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs No. 7 LJ Araujo (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink opened the match with a takedown. That trend continued two more times as Mesenbrink got a pair of takedowns and took a 9-3 lead.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink delivered another takedown and controlled LJ Araujo the entire match, and was awarded two-stalling points, extending his lead to 14-4. Mesenbrink flattened Araujo, got the reversal and another takedown to get a 19-5 lead.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink got the tech fall with the riding time.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 15-9.</p>\n                <p>174 Pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs No. 4 Christopher Minto (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines shoved Christopher Minto off the mat and over the barricade, awarding a point to Minto. Haines escaped at the beginning of the second period, which was followed by a Minto takedown. Haines trailed 4-2.</p>\n                <p>Haines got a takedown to gain a 5-4 lead. Haines got another takedown and garnered the victory 8-6.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 18-9</p>\n                <p>184 Pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs No. 7 Silas Allred (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh got the early takedown and controlled the early part of the match. Welsh garnered another takedown to lead, 6-2, going into the second period.</p>\n                <p>Welsh kicked Silas Allred\u2019s left leg to get his third takedown of the match, taking a 9-4 lead going into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Welsh continued his dominance and got the 15-5, major-decision victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 21-9.</p>\n                <p>197 Pounds: No. Josh Barr (PSU) vs No 9 Camden McDaniel (NEB)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr got the takedown early as he continued the trend of most of the Penn State matches. Barr made it difficult for Camden McDaniel to get up, and when he did, Barr would slam him back down onto the mat. Barr led 12-3 after the first period featuring four takedowns.</p>\n                <p>Barr added multiple takedowns including yanking McDaniel back into the center of the mat to get a 19-6 lead. McDaniel got his first takedown of the match to make it 19-9.</p>\n                <p>Bar got the victory by major decision 21-9.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 26-9.</p>\n                <p>Heavyweight: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs No. 4 AJ Ferrari (NEB)</p>\n                <p>AJ Ferrari tried to get a takedown to start, but couldn\u2019t get complete control of Cole Mirasola. Mirasola avoided a few takedowns by spinning out of them. Ferrari escaped early to gain a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola almost got the first takedown of the match, but Ferrari never allowed him to get full control.</p>\n                <p>Ferrari rode Mirasola for most of the third period. Ferrari kept looking for blood, but the ref didn\u2019t oblige. Ferrari got the riding-time point and got the victory 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got the victory 26-12.</p>",

    "author": "Chase Fisher | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>A filled-in crowd at Pegula Ice Arena unleashed two of its loudest reactions of the night during pregame introductions. One was for the booing of Michigan State goaltender Trey Augustine. The other was the deafening cheers for Penn State netminder Josh Fleming.</p>\n                <p>While the introductions for both goaltenders were vastly different, the reactions were as loud as they were for the same reason: both Augustine and Fleming are key to each program\u2019s top-five ranking in the country.</p>\n                <p>However, neither one got its footing on Friday in a relatively high-scoring affair. In the end, it was No. 5 Penn State on the losing end, dropping Game 1 to No. 2 Michigan State, 6-3, and ending its seven-game winning streak.</p>\n                <p>First period</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s first period started as advertised, as both teams played physically behind a raucous Pegula Ice Arena crowd. While vicious hits were exchanged on both sides, Michigan State was the one to take advantage of them early.</p>\n                <p>Just four minutes into the contest, defenseman Maxim Strbak retrieved a puck and fed an outlet pass to right wing Anthony Romani shortly after right wing Aiden Fink was knocked down onto the ice.</p>\n                <p>That feed led Romani into a breakaway with defenseman Jarod Crespo on the backcheck, but the Spartans\u2019 third liner was able to beat Fleming on his forehand, giving Michigan State a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Spartans piled on in a chaotic final five minutes of the first frame, beginning with defenseman Owen West flicking a wrist shot from the point on the power play past Fleming\u2019s left blocker to extend Michigan State\u2019s lead to 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Then, Romani tallied his second score of the night on the man-advantage, one-timing a shot off a backhand feed from center Cayden Lindstrom to make it 3-0 Spartans.</p>\n                <p>Second period</p>\n                <p>Similarly to the first period, the action began four minutes into the second frame. However, it wasn\u2019t scoring that sparked the deafening crowd pops \u2014 it was several massive hits and scrums.</p>\n                <p>Lindstrom started the party, delivering a crushing hit on Fink near the blue line. Left wing Gavin McKenna retaliated, leveling his former teammate on the Medicine Hat Tigers seconds later.</p>\n                <p>Both Lindstrom and McKenna, as well as defenseman Colin Ralph, were sentenced to five-minute majors. However, despite earning a five-minute man-advantage, Penn State couldn\u2019t score or generate dangerous chances.</p>\n                <p>Those values held true on the Nittany Lions\u2019 second power play of the period, until defenseman Jackson Smith gloved down a wobbling puck and fired a wrist shot past Augustine and into the back of the net, cutting Penn State\u2019s deficit to 3-1 with a hair under nine minutes remaining in the period.</p>\n                <p>But that momentum didn\u2019t last long, as left wing Lev Katzin conceded a costly turnover behind the goal, which led to right wing Porter Martone jamming home a goal through Fleming\u2019s five hole and extending Michigan State\u2019s lead to 4-1.</p>\n                <p>Third period</p>\n                <p>For the third consecutive period, the action started four minutes into the frame. But for the first time, it was via a Penn State goal, cutting its deficit to 4-2.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 tally came from center Reese Laubach, who tapped in a shot on the backdoor of Augustine, which came from a pass from the point by defenseman Carter Schade.</p>\n                <p>Penn State continued its comeback on the power play in the midst of an exchange of penalties. Near the midway point of the period, right wing JJ Wiebusch took a rebound off the boards and fed left wing Matt DiMarsico at the goalmouth, where the junior hammered the puck past Augustine on one knee, cutting the Nittany Lions\u2019 deficit to 4-3.</p>\n                <p>However, that\u2019s all Penn State could muster up in its comeback bid, as Romani iced the game to finish off his hat trick and left wing Daniel Russell hit an empty-net goal with 22 seconds remaining to lead Michigan State to a 6-3 win.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Defenseman Casey Aman, who was listed as day-to-day according to coach Guy Gadowsky on Tuesday, was inactive on Friday.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State and Michigan State will duel in the first-ever outdoor game at Beaver Stadium at 1 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>To kick off another weekend series, Penn State returned to Rec Hall after getting swept by McKendree to host No. 3 Hawai'i in its White Out game.</p>\n                <p>The Rainbow Warriors weren\u2019t affected by the snowstorm in State College, though, traveling just under 5000 miles to take down the Nittany Lions and pick up a 3-0 sweep in the first game of the series.</p>\n                <p>No. 3 Hawai'i got on the board first and got hot off the rip, quickly jumping up to a 4-1 lead in the early running.</p>\n                <p>A lot of points in the early stages usually come from service errors, but it was just kill after kill for both sides, with Kainoa Wade kicking it off.</p>\n                <p>Penn State found itself down 7-3 after a Sean Harvey service error, and things were looking bleak, but the Nittany Lions were stepping on the heels of the Rainbow Warriors despite falling in a hole early on.</p>\n                <p>Harvey, far and away leading the blue and white in kills, currently with 71, notched another in an effort to cut his squad\u2019s deficit to just one point.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions took their first lead thanks to a Matthew Luoma ace put them up 15-14 in a tightly contested first frame.</p>\n                <p>Just when it looked like Penn State was going to pull ahead, Hawai'i went on a 4-0 scoring run on its way to capturing the first set 25-22.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back Adrien Roure kills kicked off another Rainbow Warrior scoring run as they quickly got out to a 7-3 lead in the second set with Luomo giving Penn State its only point not from errors.</p>\n                <p>Really turning it up, Hawaii went on a suffocating 5-0 scoring run, backed by kills from Roure and Wade, which were followed by back-to-back service aces out of Tread Rosenthal.</p>\n                <p>The Rainbow Warriors were laying the hurt on the blue and white as they sailed to an 18-9 lead thanks to that scoring run.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was failing to chip away at the lead and was stuck watching the second set slip away.</p>\n                <p>Yet another Harvey kill kept the Nittany Lions alive, though many of their points were coming off Hawai'i errors.</p>\n                <p>Just as it looked like the Rainbow Warriors were going to pull away, Penn State went on a 6-0 scoring run backed with a service ace from Owen Rose to tie it at 22-22. Rattled, Charlie Wade and Hawai'i used a timeout.</p>\n                <p>Though the Nittany Lions kept it interesting down the stretch, it wasn\u2019t enough to shake the Rainbow Warriors, who won the second set 25-23.</p>\n                <p>Another Harvey kill just couldn\u2019t match back-to-back scores from Justin Todd, which gave him five kills on the night and moved Hawai'i just one set away from a first-game sweep.</p>\n                <p>With 10 kills on the night, it felt like Harvey was doing everything by himself on the floor. Ryan Merk, who just earned EIVA defensive player of the week honors, was quiet all night, not able to lend much help.</p>\n                <p>Just like it had the rest of the night, Hawai'i immediately went on a 4-0 scoring run in the third set, with Rosenthal picking up an ace along the way.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions closed the gap, though, with Gabriel Gaige garnering an ace of his own to cut the Rainbow Warriors\u2019 lead to 6-4.</p>\n                <p>Hawai'i extended its lead to four points after a Harvey attack error, but Penn State was closing in prior to that misstep, picking up back-to-back kills.</p>\n                <p>Mark Pavlik was forced into a timeout after Hawai'i moved just nine points away from the sweep after a Finn Kearney service ace pushed his squad out to a 16-10 lead.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was dead in the water after falling behind 20-13, unable to stop Hawaii from piecing together consistent scoring drives.</p>\n                <p>In full control in the third frame, the Rainbow Warriors moved even closer with a Louis Sakanoko kill, but yet another Harvey kill kept Penn State in it for now.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, though, the Nittany Lions just couldn\u2019t climb out of the hole as Hawai'i won the third set 25-15 to pick up the sweep.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State is back in action tomorrow for game two of its early-season series against Hawai'i.</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s match is set for 5 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Snow-filled bleachers, paired with freezing weather, did not deter rowdy Penn State fans from supporting No. 4 Penn State at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>A record-setting 1,838 fans, dressed head to toe in winter gear, witnessed not only the first-ever Penn State hockey game outdoors, but a 3-0 Nittany Lions win over Robert Morris.</p>\n                <p>It wasn\u2019t until the clock struck 15 minutes left in the game that the public address announcer informed the stadium about the historic milestone. The immediate roar from the crowd lifted the Nittany Lions throughout the final minutes of the game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was excited to hear the attendance record, the bench was fired up,\u201d McKenna Walsh said. \u201cIt was cold and it\u2019s a 1 p.m. game, so it\u2019s tough to get people to come out. The fact that we set the (attendance) record at this game is pretty special.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Walsh had the honor of scoring the first-ever goal in Beaver Stadium after the puck bounced off her skate and into the net. This was only the second goal of the season for the Oswego, Illinois, native.</p>\n                <p>The historic attendance played a major role in the atmosphere throughout the game. From the opening faceoff to the final buzzer, the air was filled with chants and constant support for the players on the ice.</p>\n                <p>Katie DeSa recorded her ninth shutout of the season and was met with cheers from the fans as she headed down the tunnel. However, for the Pawcatuck, Connecticut, native, she saw this moment as a full circle, closing out her senior season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEspecially being a senior, it's great to have it in my final year,\u201d DeSa said. \u201c(I) definitely appreciate it a little more having come to Beaver (Stadium) for football games the last four years and then finally being able to play there. It\u2019s really awesome.\u201d</p>\n                <p>An energetic atmosphere was ultimately topped off with the Nittany Lions heading through the gates and down the tunnel, surrounded by handmade banners made by the \u201cRoarZone.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For coach Jeff Kampersal, the Nittany Lions\u2019 continued work together further exemplified the \u201cstandards\u201d they\u2019ve set for themselves. Penn State adapted to the unusual environment and never gave up on its goals, which only added to the trust Kampersal instills in his team.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey have higher goals than what they\u2019ve accomplished so far, but trust is our biggest core value,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cI trust them all with my life, I think they have that sort of relationship with everyone else. That\u2019s what makes us so connected on the ice.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The connection between player and coach could be seen since the start of the season, as Penn State had its best start in program history, winning 16-straight games.</p>\n                <p>From being a part of the first hockey game inside Beaver Stadium to setting records throughout the season, there is a belief in the locker room that this historic game set the program on track to reach new heights.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHere at Penn State, we get so much support it\u2019s insane,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI think that people are starting to realize women\u2019s sports really matter. So, I think that was a big step for us, and then (fans) coming here supporting us, it\u2019s super special.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>There was a lot of unfamiliar territory explored when No. 4 Penn State took the ice to face conference opponent Robert Morris University.</p>\n                <p>A roughly 40-yard walk to the bench from the tunnel, Beaver Stadium public address announcer Joe Putnam announced the starters, opposed to Pegula Ice Arena\u2019s Rodney Martin, and the students of the Roar Zone were not breathing down the neck of the opposing goaltender.</p>\n                <p>However, all that went away when the familiar sound of the goal horn echoed through Beaver Stadium, signaling a goal from McKenna Walsh, the first outdoor goal in Penn State hockey history, en route to a 3-0 win over the Colonials.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a legend now,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said, and referred to her as a \u201clunch-pailer,\u201d focusing on her work ethic. \u201cEvery day she goes to work with a lunch pail and grinds. She\u2019s not gonna get a ton of points, but she\u2019ll defend the other team\u2019s better players. She\u2019ll win faceoffs, she\u2019ll grind, get in the goalie\u2019s mix and stir things up a bit.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After a scoreless first period, the Nittany Lions finally struck 12 minutes into the middle frame of action.</p>\n                <p>After Walsh stick-lifted and knocked Robert Morris winger Rowyn Ringor off the puck, Katelyn Roberts deflected Catriona Crarer\u2019s attempt to dump the puck into the Colonials\u2019 offensive zone and knocked the puck into the neutral zone.</p>\n                <p>Walsh picked up the puck at the red line and skated up the near-side boards in a 2-on-1 with Shelby Shane, who was promoted from the extra skater position to the third-line left wing position in coach Kampersal\u2019s adjusted lineup in the absence of Tessa Janecke, Matilde Fantin and Nicole Hall for Olympic purposes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShelby\u2019s a really smart player,\u201d Kampersal said. He also mentioned that despite the freshman\u2019s low minutes this season, she\u2019s a happy kid. \u201cShe thrived when her number was called and we would expect nothing less from her. I thought she was dynamite as well, made the plays that she needed to make.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After she crossed the blue line and entered the Penn State offensive zone, the Oswego, Illinois, native skated to the near-side faceoff circle and delivered a centering pass to Shane. While Walsh cut toward the net, Shane sent a backhand pass that kissed Walsh\u2019s skate and effortlessly slid through the five-hole of Robert Morris goaltender Maggie Hatch.</p>\n                <p>Despite it being a historic goal, that wasn\u2019t even a thought in Walsh\u2019s mind. She said she didn't, at the moment, realize the significance of her goal. Instead, it was more important for a different reason.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was more excited to get us on the board because I knew once we got one, we were gonna get another,\u201d Walsh said.</p>\n                <p>The goal served as the first of the game and the second of the year for the sophomore center, the sixth of her career. Shane now has three points in her collegiate career, all on assists.</p>\n                <p>Walsh also praised the Kutztown, Pennsylvania, native Shane.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought she did awesome today and obviously [I] wouldn\u2019t have scored without her, but she did really good, and I can\u2019t wait to see how she\u2019s gonna excel from here,\u201d Walsh said.</p>\n                <p>Walsh and the Nittany Lions will conclude their series against Robert Morris on Saturday at 6 p.m. at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s hockey team competed at Beaver Stadium against in-conference opponent Robert Morris for the first time in program history, at 1 p.m. Friday.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions increased their winning streak to six with a 3-0 victory over the Colonials behind a two-goal second period. Goaltender Katie DeSa closed out the game with 13 saves on 13 shots and recorded her 22nd career shutout, building on her program record as she now leads the nation with nine on the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey set their own standards, as coaches, we can guide, we can work on them with habits and things like that,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal said. \u201cBut they're doing their own thing on a day like today.\u201d</p>\n                <p><a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/women_hockey/penn-state-womens-hockeys-beaver-stadium-game-breaks-single-game-attendance-record/article_da895c98-bde6-4e76-af43-60d6c1767c6e.html\" target=\"_blank\">The contest set the record for the highest single-game attendance in program history, with 1,838 spectators watching in person.</a></p>\n                <p>Less than a minute and a half into the first period, the ice staff got to work on repairing a hole behind goaltender Maggie Hatch\u2019s crease along the boards. The repairs stalled action for roughly five minutes before the players were able to resume play.</p>\n                <p>Penn State played its first game without captain Tessa Janecke (USA), Nicole Hall (Sweden) and Matilde Fantin (Italy) as each of them will be competing in the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games. Mya Vaslet filled Janecke\u2019s spot as the first-line center, playing alongside Katelyn Roberts and Abby Stonehouse.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Vaslet) managed the game really well, and she's really fast, and so that'll allow her speed to help out,\u201d Kampersal said.</p>\n                <p>Taylor Lum and McKenna Walsh moved up to play with Shelby Shane on the third line in the absence of Hall and Fantin.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white didn\u2019t lack offensive firepower, however, as Penn State consistently peppered goaltender Hatch. At the final buzzer, the Nittany Lions outshot the Colonials 42-13.</p>\n                <p>Tensions flared in the early game as the blue and white controlled possession, as the starting forwards Grace Outwater, Maddy Christian and Mikah Keller generated offensive opportunities on the doorstep. Penn State\u2019s physicality prompted a response by the Colonials\u2019 defense as pushing and shoving ensued.</p>\n                <p>With 4:29 remaining in the first period, Keller intercepted a breakout pass in the slot, striding down on the Nittany Lions\u2019 first true open opportunity. Her wrist shot was saved by Hatch\u2019s hot glove.</p>\n                <p>Two minutes later, Penn State got its best chance of the period as Walsh, Lum and Shane surged on a 3-on-0. Walsh deked to Hatch\u2019s glove side and had a step on the goaltender, but her backhand shot was saved by Hatch\u2019s extended pad to keep the game scoreless heading into the first intermission.</p>\n                <p>Robert Morris took its first penalty just under three minutes into the second period. Laura Eustace cross-checked a Nittany Lion in her own defensive end. However, the power play lacked substance and the teams were back to even-strength without incident.</p>\n                <p>Walsh scored the first Division I goal at Beaver Stadium with 7:52 remaining in the second period. Shane gave a backhand pass to Walsh, who seized the moment for her second goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI was more excited to get us on the board, because I knew once we got one, we were going to get another,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI was just happy that it went in the back of the net.\u201d</p>\n                <p>And then the floodgates opened. Fifty seconds after the opening goal, Christian followed up with a one-timer courtesy of Outwater\u2019s centering feed to the middle of the slot that found a hole under Hatch\u2019s blocker.</p>\n                <p>The third period slowed the pace of play considerably, with neither team generating key opportunities through most of the frame. Both teams relied on defense to mitigate odd-man rushes and breakaways, leading to a stalemate.</p>\n                <p>However, with 4:22 remaining in the game, Outwater stripped a Colonial defender of the puck in the slot and flicked a shot over Hatch\u2019s glove to take a 3-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions coasted to the final buzzer to improve to 25-4 on the season.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to Pegula Ice Arena tomorrow at 6 p.m. to close out its two-game series against Robert Morris.</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Building a dream hockey lineup out of Penn State football players",
    "author": "Avery Hill | Football Editor",
    "description": "<p>A lot of hockey will be played in Beaver Stadium, so let\u2019s get weird with it.</p>\n                <p>With their athleticism, physicality and the chance to be esteemed skaters, I decided to build the dream Penn State hockey lineup out of past and present Nittany Lion football players.</p>\n                <p>If Guy Gadowsky is reading this, I\u2019d advise trying talking to the NCAA to approve eligibility waivers to bring a title to Hockey Valley. Anyway, here goes nothing.</p>\n                <p>Left wing: Tyler Warren</p>\n                <p>Let\u2019s get the obvious one out the way. You can\u2019t convince me Tyler Warren doesn\u2019t fit into any sport, including things like water polo, bocce ball and even professional TAG.</p>\n                <p>The only question was what position does Warren fit best. Playing on the left wing will allow him to attack the net, find open skaters and play a bit of defense as well.</p>\n                <p>In emergency situations, Warren easily slots in at goalie or defenseman as well, but goalie would take away a chance for him to make an impact offensively. At 6-foot-6, 258 pounds, he\u2019d be a huge wing, but his presence would make him easily a polarizing force on ice.</p>\n                <p>Center: Michael Robinson</p>\n                <p>Michael Robinson could do just about everything at Penn State, so I\u2019m confident he can win every faceoff too.</p>\n                <p>Robinson would represent yet another jack-of-all-trades for Gadowsky\u2019s squad, becoming a force on the defensive end while being able to dish it to Warren and others offensively.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, the 2005 Big Ten MVP\u2019s skillset includes the stamina to stay on the ice for longer shifts. I may not have ever played hockey, but I think I\u2019ve already built a championship-winning team.</p>\n                <p>Right wing: Saquon Barkley</p>\n                <p>This list is incorrect if SaQuads doesn\u2019t crack the offensive lineup. With freak athleticism paired with strength and skills that likely far surpasses anyone in the NHL currently, he\u2019d be an absolute superstar on the ice.</p>\n                <p>Saquon Barkley would give opponents nightmares anytime he laced the skates up, and his breakaways would be a sight to see.</p>\n                <p>Let Barkley make it to the NHL. Trust me, I\u2019ll be tuned into each All-Star Weekend to watch him put on a show.</p>\n                <p>Defenseman: LaVar Arrington</p>\n                <p>While I\u2019m not sure how much leaping LaVar Arrington will be able to do on the ice, I think he can be a driving force on the defensive end.</p>\n                <p>With the unit already assembled on the offensive end, all Gadowsky needs Arrington to do is deliver body-crushing board checks and become an obstacle near the net.</p>\n                <p>You can really slot any of ST1X C1TY in this position, and even go with Michael Mauti. But I\u2019m sticking with Arrington.</p>\n                <p>Defenseman: John Urschel</p>\n                <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking here. The 300-pound John Urschel has no business on ice. I argue he does.</p>\n                <p>Urschel, who earned his PhD at MIT in mathematics and scored a 43-of-50 on the NFL Wonderlic test, is extremely intelligent. He could be the cerebral captain on this team, though Gadowsky may need to do a bit of load management if he\u2019s on the ice for too long.</p>\n                <p>Even outside of his intellect, Urschel has the strength and the quickness to translate to skills on skates. Pick Urschel, and you get a leader that can help push the team through tough moments in the pursuit of glory.</p>\n                <p>Goalie: Chop Robinson</p>\n                <p>Chop Robinson got off the ball better than just about anyone during his time at Penn State, such reflexes and agility is perfect for playing goalie.</p>\n                <p>Robinson may not enjoy being unable to lunge out and level opposing skaters, but the position would allow him to make plenty of plays for his team.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, his incredible bend would allow for some highlight reel saves at the net, making him a netminder to watch every night he\u2019s out there.</p>\n                <p>Top players off bench: Justin King, wing; Daryus Dixson, Kaytron Allen, center, defenseman; Sean Clifford, goalie</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky\u2019s got a big and physical lineup going so far, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be sent to the penalty box a ton or even suspended, so he\u2019s going to need some key players on his bench.</p>\n                <p>Justin King, who ran a 4.31 40-yard dash, has the speed to either race down to save a short-handed breakaway, or get off on one of his own during the power play.</p>\n                <p>Daryus Dixson has the length and scrapiness to really make a difference defensively, using his stick to become a menace on the defensive end.</p>\n                <p>Kaytron Allen\u2019s motor never stops. Expect him to be aggressive on faceoffs and a presence not to be messed with on a 2-on-1.</p>\n                <p>Then at goalie it\u2019ll be Sean Clifford. A bigger goalie can\u2019t be sustainable for the whole season. Clifford\u2019s IQ and athleticism allows for a change of pace when Robinson\u2019s out for the night, so he\u2019s an easy one to slot in.</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

After the Raiders\u2019 season-opening loss against Penn State, they travelled to Charlottesville, where they lost to No. 5 Virginia by 10 goals.</p>\n                <p>The Raiders won the Patriot League championship last year, getting two ranked wins in the process. The title secured their spot in the NCAA Tournament, setting up a first-round rematch with Penn State, which ended Colgate\u2019s season.</p>\n                <p>Colgate had three players with 67 or more points in 2025, but all three either transferred or graduated after the season. Its most productive returner will be senior midfielder Hunter Drouin, who had 48 points for the Raiders last year.</p>\n                <p>Drouin was named a preseason All-American honorable mention by Inside Lacrosse ahead of the 2026 season, a recognition he also received prior to his last campaign.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State, the biggest challenge will be figuring out how to succeed in the post-Matt Traynor era. Traynor scored 153 points as a Nittany Lion, 61 of which came in his senior season.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019ll be replaced on the first midfield line by star sophomore Hunter Aquino, who scored 37 points in a freshman campaign that saw him be named Big Ten Freshman of the Year and a second-team All-American by Inside Lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>The Easton, Pennsylvania, native has already been named a preseason second-team All-American by Inside Lacrosse, joining fellow second-teamer Alex Ross and honorable mention Jon King.</p>\n                <p>Penn State leads the all-time series with Colgate 16-10. The Raiders\u2019 last win against the Nittany Lions came in 2024 when they secured a 13-12 victory in that year\u2019s season opener.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>One of the most highly anticipated matchups of the 2025-26 season for Penn State will take place on Friday when the Nittany Lions host Nebraska inside the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have dominated the <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/wrestling/series-history-penn-state-faces-nebraska-for-20th-all-time-matchup/article_9d74b68e-34e7-4610-81d4-261c991426ea.html\" target=\"_blank\">series history</a>, with Cael Sanderson holding the edge since he took over in Happy Valley over Cornhuskers\u2019 head coach Mark Manning.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how each matchup breaks down.</p>\n                <p>125 pounds: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. Alan Koehler (NU)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl will take on the lone unranked wrestler in the entire dual in Alan Koehler. Lilledahl is the top wrestler at 125 pounds, and will have the easiest matchup of the entire dual.</p>\n                <p>The 125-pound bout is likely to start off the dual and could be the quickest of the matches with Lilledahl\u2019s style of wrestling. He could go on the attack early and often, scoring a lot of points en route to a possible bonus-point victory.</p>\n                <p>133 pounds: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 10 Jacob Van Dee (NU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze will have another major test with Jacob Van Dee on Friday. Van Dee is 12-3 and dropped from his No. 8 ranking after losing to Ben Davino of Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>Blaze will take on Davino in two weeks when Ohio State faces the Nittany Lions in the second BJC dual. With Blaze\u2019s low style, it\u2019ll be tough for Van Dee to score points, as Blaze has restricted points all season. In his freshman year, he\u2019s well in contention to win the Big Ten and national title.</p>\n                <p>141 pounds: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 4 Brock Hardy (NU)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis\u2019 stamina will be put to the test against Brock Hardy. Hardy, just like Van Dee, fell against Ohio State to a highly ranked wrestler when he lost to Jesse Mendez.</p>\n                <p>Mendez appears to be in a tier of his own so it didn\u2019t come as a surprise when Hardy lost. Now, Hardy will take on Davis, who\u2019s starting to find more and more comfort at his new weight class.</p>\n                <p>If Davis can hold up stamina wise, things could get interesting down the stretch.</p>\n                <p>149 pounds: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 18 Chance Lamer (NU)</p>\n                <p>This is the first of the gauntlet of wrestlers Penn State brings to the lineup. Shayne Van Ness is the top wrestler at 149 pounds and has showcased an unreal gas tank as of late. Van Ness is coming off the back of a 31-point performance against Maryland after nearly getting pinned.</p>\n                <p>Chance Lamer, who only has three losses on the season despite his No. 18 ranking, will have to step up his game even more to take down Van Ness, who\u2019s proved he\u2019s taken another step from his redshirt sophomore year.</p>\n                <p>157 pounds: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. No. 5 Antrell Taylor (NU)</p>\n                <p>Another test for the highly regarded freshman.</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke will take on Antrell Taylor, the 2025 National Champion, in a match to really see where Duke is in his freshman year. After a slower start, Taylor appears poised to get back the national title match.</p>\n                <p>Taylor will be the big test for Duke, and if Duke comes out on top, it\u2019ll be all eyes on two weeks from now, when the freshman phenom takes on No. 1 Brandon Cannon.</p>\n                <p>165 pounds: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 7 LJ Araujo (NU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink continues to raise his level, asserting himself as one of the favorites for the Hodge Trophy. LJ Araujo has shown signs of potential, already ranking No. 7 in the country, while holding an 11-5 record.</p>\n                <p>Mesenbrink is on another level from any wrestler he\u2019s faced this season. Araujo fell to Mikey Caliendo of Iowa, a wrestler Mesenbrink is 7-0 against. All signs point to another big win for Mesenbrink as there\u2019s yet to be a wrestler to keep it close with the Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>174 pounds: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 4 Christopher Minto (NU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines is another wrestler who\u2019s raised his style to another level. Haines made the powerful jump last season, focusing on back points, something Mesenbrink is doing this season. He\u2019ll face Christopher Minto, who\u2019s 14-3 on the season compared to Haines\u2019 14-0 record.</p>\n                <p>Minto fell to Patrick Kennedy on Jan. 23, a wrestler that Haines has a 3-0 record against. Similar to Mesenbrink, that matchup against the Iowa wrestler could be the overall deciding factor, with Haines poised to get back to the top of the podium.</p>\n                <p>184 pounds: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 6 Silas Allred (NU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh is up to No. 1 after his victory over Angelo Ferrari. Welsh will face Silas Allred, who appears to be in the second grouping of wrestlers nationally at 184 pounds. The top group features both Welsh and Ferrari in addition to Minnesota\u2019s Max McEnelly and Missouri\u2019s Aeoden Sinclair.</p>\n                <p>Allred could make a statement, but the momentum could be fully on the Nittany Lions\u2019 side by this point, proving to be too much against Welsh, who\u2019s given up minimal points across the entire season.</p>\n                <p>197 pounds: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 9 Camden McDanel (NU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr is another Penn State wrestler who appears to be in a tier of his own. Camden McDanel has proven himself as an All-American threat, but taking down Barr will be a whole different task.</p>\n                <p>Barr has just two losses in the last 12 months, also holding one of the biggest moments of the BJC duals last season when he defeated Jacob Cardenas in tiebreakers.</p>\n                <p>McDanel is 14-4, while Barr sits at 12-0. Since Barr\u2019s return from injury, he\u2019s undefeated and remains dominant, culminating in another potential dominant performance from the Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>285 pounds: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. 4 AJ Ferrari (NU)</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola will take on AJ Ferrari to likely close out the dual \u2014 if the dual begins at 125 pounds like it typically does. Ferrari and Mirasola match up well weight wise, with the Cornhusker jumping to heavyweight this season after wrestling at 197 pounds a year ago.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola has performed well against wrestlers closer to his size, but Ferrari\u2019s unique style could cause issues. The match will likely be very low scoring as Ferrari has a more conservative style of wrestling, but could overpower Mirasola with his strength if the opportunity arises.</p>\n                <p>Based on the lineups, the dual will likely be out of hand by this point, but could play a major factor in rankings, Big Ten seeding and even NCAA Tournament seeding when the calendar turns to March.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | Projecting Bridget Nemeth's stateline after missing 2025 season",
    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The most victories in a single-season by any pitcher in Penn State softball history, top five in both strikeouts and innings pitched in a single campaign, unanimous First-Team All-Big Ten, Big Ten Freshman of the Year and a top-40 ERA in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Those are just some of the many accomplishments that Bridget Nemeth has achieved in her career as a Nittany Lion. The catch, Nemeth achieved all of them in just one season.</p>\n                <p>The junior right-hander had arguably the best freshman season and pitching performances in program history. Given her rookie year success, the Glendora, California, native had plenty of eyes on her ahead of her sophomore season. However, Nemeth was sidelined for 2025 due to an undisclosed injury.</p>\n                <p>Those eyes now turn to the 2026 season to see how Nemeth\u2019s return to the circle will play out.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look at some projected stat lines for Nemeth\u2019s upcoming junior campaign.</p>\n                <p>ERA and nonconference opponents</p>\n                <p>In 2024, Nemeth\u2019s 1.77 ERA finished second in the Big Ten. In 2026, the junior will have to face some tough lineups right from the get-go. The blue and white are scheduled to face four Power 4 teams in its first five games.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s safe to assume that Nemeth won\u2019t get the starting nod in all of these, but she\u2019ll certainly be on stand by. The one in particular to look out for is when Penn State takes on BYU on Feb. 7.</p>\n                <p>The Cougars\u2019 .308 team batting average finished third in the Big 12 and top-50 nationally. The hitter that poses the biggest threat to Nemeth and company is sophomore Ilove\u2019a Brittingham. The Nipomo, California, native\u2019s .410 batting average and 69 RBI placed third in the conference, additionally her 21 home runs finished second.</p>\n                <p>The opponents only get tougher as the month goes on, as the Nittany Lions travel to Knoxville for two games against ESPN/USA Softball preseason No. 4 Tennessee.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Vols lost Taylor Pannell, who was one of the SEC\u2019s most productive hitters last year, to the transfer portal, but gained a batting gem in Boise State transfer Sophia Knight.</p>\n                <p>Knight set a Mountain West record last campaign with 103 hits, and she was also the only player in Division I softball to record an 100 hit season. The junior also finished with the nation's third-best batting average at .486.</p>\n                <p>Knight\u2019s going to be one of the toughest bats that Nemeth has to face, and they\u2019ll likely have to battle multiple times. This factor could either make or break Nemeth\u2019s ERA early on in the season, and possibly set the tone for the rest.</p>\n                <p>Given the state of Penn State\u2019s early schedule, I think heading into conference play, Nemeth will post an ERA close to 3.00.</p>\n                <p>ERA and Big Ten competition</p>\n                <p>It won\u2019t get much easier for Nemeth when conference play comes around, starting in mid-March. The Nittany Lions\u2019 opening and closing Big Ten series is where Nemeth will likely find her toughest battles.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opens conference play with a trip to Eugene to face preseason No.5 Oregon, and will close it by hosting preseason No.9 Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>Both opponents ranked top-three in the Big Ten and top-10 nationally when it came to batting average and total hits.</p>\n                <p>Oregon\u2019s best returning hitter is sophomore infielder Rylee McCoy, who reached single-season program highs a year ago with a tied best 19 home runs and top-ranked 32 extra-base hits.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska returns a strong pair of senior bats in reigning Big Ten Player of the Year Jordyn Frahm and Ava Kuszak. Both finished with top-15 batting averages in the Big Ten. Frahm\u2019s .462 average was also enough for sixth nationally. Additionally, both Frahm and Kuszak finished in the top-11 in the conference in hits.</p>\n                <p>Kuszak is the only one of these hitters that Nemeth has already faced, meeting in 2024 when Kuszak was at Wisconsin. The then-Badger went 1-for-3 with a double and a strikeout.</p>\n                <p>As Nemeth has some tough tasks ahead of her, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll post an ERA as low as she did in her freshman campaign, instead I think she\u2019ll finish near the 2.00-2.15 range.</p>\n                <p>Strikeouts</p>\n                <p>In 2024, Nemeth tossed 202 strikeouts, becoming the fourth Nittany Lion to surpass 200 in a season. This also put her third in the conference in total strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>I think it\u2019ll be hard for Nemeth to reach 200 strikeouts again, but it\u2019s certainly possible. My prediction is that her final total will be somewhere between 185 and 200.</p>\n                <p>Victories</p>\n                <p>Nemeth holds the single-season program record with 23 victories. It\u2019s hard to predict how she\u2019ll fare in the win column without knowing how many appearances Nemeth will see this season.</p>\n                <p>Assuming that, like in 2024, Nemeth appears in more than half of Penn State\u2019s games, then I think she could reach 20 victories once again.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Annie Gleba | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 5 Penn State will take on Illinois in a Big Ten matchup at 1 p.m. on Sunday at Rec Hall. The match will be in support of THON. Last week, the Nittany Lions tied with Illinois in the Sam Mikulak Invitational at second place with a score of 317.650.</p>\n                <p>This season, Penn State sits at 1-0 in individual matches outside of tournament play, where it has finished 1st and 2nd. In the last competition, it performed well across the board, which greatly improved its score. With that, the Nittany Lions still have room to improve, which they will try to bring into this rematch.</p>\n                <p>In Florida, they weren\u2019t able to have all of their best gymnasts in the lineup, but are expecting them to be out on the floor Sunday. During the routines in Florida, Brayden Erickson put up the second-best floor routine of his collegiate career at a 13.050. Matt Underhill followed him with a 13.550, which was just a tenth short of his season high.</p>\n                <p>In addition to these record-breaking routines, three other Nittany Lions posted some of the highest scores of their careers, including Bobby Alessio with a 12.850 on the pommel horse, Ritam Malik with a 13.800, his best score of the season on any skill and Ricky Perez with a personal best of 13.650.</p>\n                <p>With all of these record-breaking scores, Penn State is coming into this matchup strong. Illinois arrives in this matchup with a record of 0-3-1, placing 4th at the OSU Open, and the runner-up finish in the last tournament, facing Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The Fighting Illini showed strength on the rings events, scoring a 52.700 at the OSU Open and a high performance from Hasan Aydogdu, with a 14.500 in the Sam Milulak Invitational, keeping them in close range to Penn State. The rings will be a category to watch closely at this meet, with many competitors achieving over 14 points on both sides. It could be a determining factor in the outcome of the overall match.</p>\n                <p>Other high-performing categories for the Fighting Illini are pommel horse, with two competitors scoring over 14. That includes Preston Ngai with a 14.350 and Brandon Dang sporting a 14.650. The highest score a Nittany Lion has achieved on the pommel horse this season was a 13.850 by Landon Simpson in the Sam Milulak Invitational.</p>\n                <p>This competition is expected to feature close scores, requiring both squads to ensure their top athletes are healthy and ready to perform their best routines. The outcome of this matchup will help set the tone for future conference matchups. Both teams will compete against Michigan, Ohio State and Nebraska down the line.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The start of the 2026 baseball season is almost here. As the Nittany Lions prepare to suit up for action, fans supporting the blue and white are doing the same.</p>\n                <p>Given the hectic nature of our daily lives, watching all 55 regular-season games is a tall task. Below is a guide to three games you should circle on your calendars.</p>\n                <p>These are the nonnegotiables.</p>\n                <p>Feb. 15: Kansas State (MLB Desert Invitational)</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s first test.</p>\n                <p>There is nothing like baseball in February. Sure, it\u2019s freezing cold in State College, but across the country, the blue and white will be competing in the warm state of Arizona for its first set of action.</p>\n                <p>The MLB Desert Invitational grants a favorable slate of three games for Penn State, which will take on Air Force and Grand Canyon before facing Kansas State.</p>\n                <p>The Wildcats were a respectable team competing out of the Big 12 and finished with a 32-26 record last season. While Kansas State was very solid at home, tallying an 18-3 record, the team was just 7-4 on neutral sites. Penn State finished last year with a 4-2 record on neutral sites, making this matchup an even battle.</p>\n                <p>Both teams possess similar strengths as each ranked among the best hitting teams in college baseball last season. Kansas State ranked 23rd among the entire poll last year in home runs, hitting 97 in 58 games. The Nittany Lions weren\u2019t too far behind at 47th, hitting 81 homers in 56 games.</p>\n                <p>Despite the Wildcats losing talent to the MLB, the team has been on the rise. In the last two seasons, Kansas State has reached the NCAA Tournament twice. This will be a good early test for two very even teams.</p>\n                <p>March 6-8: at Texas Tech (three-game series)</p>\n                <p>A sneaky nonconference test.</p>\n                <p>To this point, Penn State would have a decent amount of baseball under its belt. While March Madness serves as the highly coveted college sports event of this month, college baseball presents a unique show of its own.</p>\n                <p>For the blue and white, this will mark a major nonconference series ahead of Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>In the offseason, Penn State went to the portal to snag <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/baseball/penn-state-baseball-inks-texas-tech-transfer-greg-minnick/article_c3f99683-bac1-4468-add4-d340bf75d4b4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Minnick</a>, a former highly-touted recruit, who signed with Texas Tech out of high school. That may have fueled an even better duel, yet to be seen on the diamond.</p>\n                <p>Aside from looking ahead to Penn State\u2019s schedule, Texas Tech will start out with an SEC gauntlet. Having to face Oklahoma, Vanderbilt and Arkansas, it\u2019ll be a great identity test for the Red Raiders early on.</p>\n                <p>This will give a good indication of what to expect when Penn State opens up Big Ten play. After finishing last season with a subpar 20-33 record, the Red Raiders are receiving hype for a better upcoming season.</p>\n                <p>After reloading in the portal and on the recruiting trail, Texas Tech has balance across its roster. This seems like another evenly matched opponent for the Nittany Lions, who could be in for a surprising upset in early March.</p>\n                <p>April 24-26: at Oregon (three-game series)</p>\n                <p>Heading across the country for a quality Big Ten opponent.</p>\n                <p>All the talk of the town in 2026 college baseball has centered around the team in the West. And no, it\u2019s not the Oregon Ducks.</p>\n                <p>The UCLA Bruins are the team to beat. Nevertheless, Penn State will not face them in the regular season. Luckily, or unluckily, the Nittany Lions will get a stab at another Big Ten foe from the West in Oregon.</p>\n                <p>Besides serving as a premier site in college baseball, PK Park presents an intimidating atmosphere, one that is hard for opposing teams to win. In recent years, the Ducks have emerged as one of the top units in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Seeking its sixth-straight NCAA Tournament appearance, Oregon is coming off a highly successful year in 2025. The Ducks tallied a 42-16 overall record and went 22-8 in Big Ten play, finishing as the Big Ten regular-season co-champion with UCLA.</p>\n                <p>Like Texas Tech, the Ducks will be tested early on in their neutral-site contests. Playing in the \u201cLive Like Lou Las Vegas College Baseball Class,\u201d Oregon will face the likes of Vanderbilt and UC Irvine. Following that, they will face Oregon State at home. All three of those opponents were Tournament teams last season.</p>\n                <p>In Perfect Game\u2019s Preseason Top 25, the Ducks placed at No. 13. Given the national preseason attention and coach Mark Wasikowski\u2019s vast winning continuity, Oregon will pose a major threat to the Nittany Lions in 2026.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL CONTENT</p>",

After nearly a decade spent making some switches to his life in a more mature and adult fashion, dealing with some incredibly unfortunate and somewhat nasty endeavors, A$AP Rocky has put out his much anticipated fifth studio album, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb,\u201d to already incredible acclaim.</p>\n                <p>On just the first day of its release, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb\u201d amassed over 35,000,000 Spotify streams and is projected to sell just under 120,000 units of vinyl.</p>\n                <p>This doesn\u2019t come as much of a shock as the long awaited return stems all the way back to when Rocky quietly whisked himself away from music for about eight years after his 2018 album \u201cTesting.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Since his last release, Rocky has welcomed three kids with Rihanna, entered the fashion and film industry and \u2014 to put it simply \u2014 was going through it.</p>\n                <p>Now nearing 40, Rocky is back with \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb,\u201d an album that subverts expectations people have for artists as they mature. While many popular artists begin to lose their stride after they\u2019ve hit their prime, on \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb,\u201d Rocky shows that he still has plenty left in the bag.</p>\n                <p>The album opens with the humble and ballsy jam, \u201cORDER OF PROTECTION\u201d that delivers the truth from the source with Rocky starting the track by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been a lil\u2019 while since I been in the league / A couple lil\u2019 trials, couple of leaks.\u201d Right away, Rocky makes sure the audience knows the context of this project before unloading a producer masterclass on the rest of the album.</p>\n                <p>Following the opener are two heavy-hitting, true-to-form A$AP Rocky tracks in \u201cHELICOPTER\u201d and \u201cSTOLE YA FLOW,\u201d with the latter being Rocky\u2019s diss track to Drake. Here, Rocky takes that same energy seen on \u201cHELICOPTER\u201d and uses it to deliver a right hook to Drake\u2019s already banged-up ego.</p>\n                <p>Drake, famously trampled in his \u201cbeef\u201d with fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar in 2024, also had a well known on-again off-again relationship with Rocky\u2019s now wife Rihanna. \u201cSTOLE YA FLOW\u201d hits on a different level lyrically, as Rocky not only flaunts the fact that he stole Drake\u2019s once-love, but disses Drake\u2019s musicianship saying, \u201cFirst you stole my flow, so I stole yo\u2019 b \u2014.\u201d Kendrick Lamar may have delivered the final blow, but Rocky nailed the coffin shut.</p>\n                <p>After his ruthless yet poised attack on Drake, Rocky eases you into a R&amp;B soaked jam in \u201cSTAY HERE 4 LIFE\u201d featuring the rising hip-hop star Brent Faiyaz. A mellowed out tune about the processes of embracing life after a tumultuous time \u2014 whether it be fame, fatherhood, music or love, Faiyaz perfectly compliments Rocky\u2019s message on this track, as an ode to his life outside of the studio \u2014 showing love to his wife and kids as he enters back into the music scene.</p>\n                <p>One of the more unique songs on the album comes from \u201cPUNK ROCKY,\u201d a fabulous merger of early 2020\u2019s New York alternative and late modern R&amp;B. An angsty and heartfelt song where the fusion of alternative sound with Rocky\u2019s traditional rap flow makes for an intriguing listen as you get to see yet another side of Rocky\u2019s production capabilities.</p>\n                <p>Another semi-experimental song with so much class and ingenuity is the album's 13th track, \u201cROBBERY\u201d featuring Doechii. On \u201cROBBERY,\u201d Rocky lays down an intimate, smokey tune supported with some acoustic bass and drum kit pulled right off the stage of a late-night speakeasy bar.</p>\n                <p>The chemistry between Rocky and Doechii in this musical back-and-forth is perfectly complimented by the jazzy production on the track, giving a low-lit and sensual vibe. It\u2019s a song where you can actually feel the inspiration and level of commitment behind what you\u2019re hearing.</p>\n                <p>The closing track on the album is \u201cFISH N STEAK (WHAT IS IT),\u201d featuring Tyler, The Creator and Jozzy. Here, Rocky closes the door on the album with an ultra-slowed down tune designed to produce sweet sounding, melodic and chill vibes, throwing in some DJ-vinyl-scratch samples, flute, harp and traditional drum and snare to give his closer an authentically classic feel that reminds you of his early rise and long awaited return.</p>\n                <p>There are several other songs on the album that are absolute speaker boomers as well. \u201cSTOP SNITCHING\u201d featuring BossMan Dlow and Sauce Walka, \u201cAIR FORCE (BLACK DEMARCO) and \u201cTHE END\u201d featuring will.i.am and Jessica Pratt, just to name a few.</p>\n                <p>Overall, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Dumb\u201d is not only great for music culture, but it also represents something bigger in Rocky\u2019s career. In the current trends of popular music, a lot of the industry has been dumbed down by in-and-out acts \u2014 propelled by singles featured on TikTok trends and commercials \u2014 yet there are still veteran members of popular music that can leave for nearly a decade and come back to produce a smash hit album just for the love of the game.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you're like me, you eat, sleep and breathe coffee. I go to bed every night genuinely excited to wake up and drink my next cup.</p>\n                <p>A hobby of mine is trying local coffee shops and seeing what unique creations each place has to offer. Here are some of the best local places in downtown State College and beyond to get your caffeine fix.</p>\n                <p>Elixr</p>\n                <p>With a charming atmosphere, Elixr has such a quintessential coffee shop vibe to it.</p>\n                <p>I tried their hot cappuccino, and it was delicious. There was an adorable latte art flower on mine, and the attention to detail here certainly did not disappoint.</p>\n                <p>My friends ordered one of their signature drinks \u2014 an iced strawberry oatmilk latte. If coffee is not your favorite, Elixr boasts a wide range of matchas as well.</p>\n                <p>Overall, the price was affordable and the atmosphere was adorable, so I will be returning.</p>\n                <p>Irving\u2019s</p>\n                <p>Known best for their homemade bagels, Irving\u2019s also has an espresso machine, and their coffee is some of my favorite downtown.</p>\n                <p>There is plenty of seating upstairs, downstairs and outside, which is great for larger groups looking to sit together. My go-to that never disappoints is an iced caramel latte with an extra shot of espresso (paired with a breakfast sandwich, of course).</p>\n                <p>I particularly love Irving\u2019s dedication to curating special holiday and seasonal drinks.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Irving\u2019s is well known for its wide variety of homemade smoothies if you are looking for an alternate drink option. Definitely a place that offers great coffee and food for a reasonable price, and one I will certainly go back to.</p>\n                <p>Vibe Coffee Co.</p>\n                <p>This vibrant place is the perfect spot to sit with a friend. The adorable decor, large windows and bright lighting add to the atmosphere of this coffee shop.</p>\n                <p>I ordered one of their custom Penn State-themed iced lattes and it was delicious. A fun feature of Vibe is that they offer coffee flights so you can try multiple different flavors of their lattes, and split coffee cups where you enjoy two different drinks in the same vessel.</p>\n                <p>Vibe uses farm-fresh milk and you can genuinely taste such a huge difference in the quality as well as the freshness.</p>\n                <p>If you are looking for other options, they also make their own fresh-squeezed lemonade. With moderately priced items and quality coffee, Vibe is a must-visit place downtown.</p>\n                <p>Bagel Crust</p>\n                <p>With two downtown locations, Bagel Crust is probably not your first thought when you think of a morning coffee.</p>\n                <p>However, I have found they offer the least expensive coffee in State College by far.</p>\n                <p>I ordered an iced coffee with a splash of milk, and it was very refreshing with a bold flavor. Additionally, the seating at Bagel Crust is pretty vast, and lots of space is available.</p>\n                <p>Sowers Harvest Cafe</p>\n                <p>Offering healthy cuisine and a wide range of custom drinks, Sowers makes an incredible iced caramel latte.</p>\n                <p>With farm-fresh milk, their coffee is always rich, creamy and flavorful. Sowers boasts very affordable pricing, given that most of their ingredients are locally sourced.</p>\n                <p>The indoor and outdoor seating offers plenty of options for large groups and the atmosphere provides such a comforting and calming energy.</p>\n                <p>I highly recommend stopping by for coffee or lunch.</p>\n                <p>Pump Station</p>\n                <p>Located just outside of State College in Boalsburg, Pump Station is an aesthetic gas station-themed coffee shop that even has a drive-thru.</p>\n                <p>The decorations inside include vintage wall decor and historical gas station displays, sure to make you feel like you\u2019re getting \u201cfuel\u201d for your car and not you.</p>\n                <p>I ordered a cold brew with vanilla cold foam \u2014 you can get it in any flavor you want, and it was the perfect balance of boldness and creamy vanilla essence.</p>\n                <p>Pump Station offers plenty of seating near large garage-esque windows. With moderate pricing, it is definitely worth the five-minute drive outside of downtown.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "New Year, new me | Why the \u201875 Hard Challenge\u2019 is effective",
    "author": "Skylar Williamson I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>When the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 1, the pressure of choosing a New Year\u2019s resolution starts all over again, just as it did the year before. People can sometimes find themselves stuck on what they can improve during the next 12 months.</p>\n                <p>The viral 75 Hard Challenge combines physical and mental components that intrigue people on the internet, with rules that create the perfect concoction for a healthy new year.</p>\n                <p>The challenge was created in 2019 by Andy Frisella, a podcaster and motivational speaker. He described his challenge as a \u201cmental toughness,\u201d less concerned with losing weight and more about building self confidence and determination.</p>\n                <p>Like many fitness challenges, 75 Hard grew through social media. During COVID-19, millions of people spent their time inside trying to stay in shape, waiting for the world to open back up.</p>\n                <p>The hashtag \u201875Hard\u2019 now has over a million posts on Instagram and millions more spread over different social platforms, especially TikTok.</p>\n                <p>The main rules of the challenge seem simple: follow a healthy diet, perform two 45-minute workouts a day \u2014 one must be outdoors \u2014 and no alcohol.</p>\n                <p>The other daily rules include drinking one gallon of water, reading 10 pages of a nonfiction book and taking a progress photo, but the catch is slipping up equals starting over from day one.</p>\n                <p>The first step is choosing the right diet for whoever is doing the challenge.</p>\n                <p>Penny Kris-Etherton said people are attracted to a flexible diet, which is shown in the 2025 update from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) with its new slogan: \u201cEat Healthy Your Way!\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cA healthy diet can be implemented in a lot of different ways,\u201d Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition, said. \u201cConsistency with that diet is important.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said younger generations like to do things \u201ctheir way\u201d and that\u2019s what 75 Hard gives them the opportunity to do.</p>\n                <p>The physical activity part of the challenge is just as flexible as the dieting. The only strict part is one of the two daily exercises needs to be outside.</p>\n                <p>Travis Masterson said the 75 Hard Challenge gives people the freedom to adjust their exercising to their own lifestyles.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen we look at successful weight-loss programs, it's (75 Hard) about the level of exercise we recommend in a day anyway,\u201d Masterson, an assistant professor, said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that they keep it very vague because that\u2019s going to mean different things for different people.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Exercise can be a walk in the park with your friends, and for people looking for a challenge, it can be a full-body workout in the gym. Bottomline, increasing physical activity is the overall goal.</p>\n                <p>Masterson said figuring out not only what is best for the body, but what will stick long term, is important to be aware of.</p>\n                <p>\u201cRather than building very strict rule sets around things, it\u2019s (75 Hard) teaching you to be disciplined and consistent with whatever you can do,\u201d Masterson said. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of why it\u2019s so valuable.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Removing alcohol is where the concerns of 75 Hard come in. Michael Russell said if a person who drinks frequently cuts out alcohol, there are several changes that are apparent over time.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf you cut out alcohol for a long period of time, your sleep quality will start to improve pretty dramatically,\u201d Russell, an assistant professor, said. \u201cFor young adults, the other thing you will see is a lot more emotional regulation.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Although this seems like the hardest part for every college student, cutting out alcohol can significantly improve their quality of life if taken seriously, according to Russell. Having \u201changxiety\u201d is just one example of the negative effects of drinking.</p>\n                <p>Russell said the downside of the 75 Hard Challenge is the rebound effect it can have, especially with alcohol.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible if someone drinks when they\u2019re out with friends and messes up the challenge, they will just drink more because the challenge is now over and they have to start over,\u201d Russell said.</p>\n                <p>Overall though, the benefits of the challenge are undeniable \u2014 it can be used as an effective starting point for a healthier life.</p>\n                <p>\u201cGetting people on the track to just thinking about their health is a huge step forward,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.</p>\n                <p>As the viral challenge progressed over the years, people started creating their own versions and adding personal goals, like getting eight hours of sleep daily. A lighter version of 75 Hard is 75 Soft, where people follow similar rules to the original challenge but give themselves more leeway for failure.</p>\n                <p>The 75 Hard Challenge allows people to take their own individual goals and put them into something that is about more than just losing weight, making it a good New Year\u2019s resolution.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a comprehensive program with nutrition and physical activity included but also reading books,\u201d Kris-Etherton said. \u201cThat\u2019s what health is. It's not just one thing.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Sami Altmire | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s gymnastics heads to New Jersey to take on Rutgers for week 4. This is the third Big Ten opponent for the Nittany Lions so far, and they look strong as they head east.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white are coming off three straight wins after narrowly beating Maryland in their meet up on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The Scarlet Knights are coming off a loss against Washington, which was their second Big Ten matchup of the season. The first was Ohio State, which resulted in a loss, as well. Rutgers competed in and won two tri-meets to start off its season, but has yet to make a splash in the Big Ten season. It hopes to get a win against the Nittany Lions this weekend.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has been a strong force at the beginning of this season, putting up great scores across the board and keeping the good times going with win after win. The blue and white seem to be particularly strong on vault and bars, really creating a lineup of gymnasts that are both strong in both of these events.</p>\n                <p>Ava Piedrahita and Elizabeth Leary are all over the score sheet for the Nittany Lions, and like against Maryland last weekend, these two gymnasts have been consistently putting up great scores on vault and beam. Leary had a strong weekend, going 9.825 on vault and 9.875 on bars. Piedrahita went 9.900 on both events, leading the scoring for the blue and white in both events.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have a really great rotation going on. Ellie Monahan, Dani Latronica, Kalea McElligott, as well as Leary and Piedrahita, are in constant rotation for Penn State. With McElligott and Monahan both putting up 9.800 plus on both floor and beam, the team has the opportunity to do really well against not only Rutgers but also other Big Ten teams.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers has a few gymnasts who are really strong all-around, or in more than just one event. Gabrielle Dildy was a top performer in the Ball State Tri meet against Ball State and Western Michigan. Dildy put up a 9.825 on beam and a 9.850 on vault, which won her individual all-around and vault awards.</p>\n                <p>In the Rutgers Tri meet against Temple and Brockport, Delaney Adrian was a standout as an all-around gymnast. Adrian scored first on beam with a score of 9.825, and also took home a personal best of 9.875 on floor.</p>\n                <p>Emily Leese was also really valuable for the Scarlet Knights in the Rutgers Tri meet, but has been contributing to high vault scores so far this season. Leese scored a 9.900 on vault against Temple and Brockport, and then scored a 9.850, coming in first on vault against Washington this past Friday.</p>\n                <p>If Rutgers plays its cards right and creates a really great lineup for this weekend, it can send the Nittany Lions home with their first loss of the season. Both of these teams have the ability to cover all of their bases with talent and have depth in their rosters.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>With a 1-4 record on the road, Penn State visited Northwestern in hopes of earning its first conference win and first win in January.</p>\n                <p>That record didn\u2019t get any better Thursday night, though, as the Nittany Lions now find themselves in an eight-game losing streak after falling to the Wildcats 94-73 to remain winless in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Ivan Juri\u0107 won the opening tipoff, giving the blue and white a prime opportunity to get off on the right foot, but a Josh Reed turnover led to a Max Green three-pointer that put the Wildcats on the board first.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades entered Thursday\u2019s match with a 1-2 record over Northwestern, and the fourth meeting was getting off to a good start.</p>\n                <p>The two foes were trading three pointers in the early running of the first half when an Eli Rice long-range basket tied the affair at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>Rice entered the contest against the Wildcats as Penn State\u2019s most efficient three-point shooter, knocking down 45.4% of his attempts from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern was quickly seizing control in the early stages of the game but Rice knocked down his ninth point to once again tie it back up as he went 3-4 from three-point distance, hoping to stay hot.</p>\n                <p>Though the Wildcats had been in control so far, Penn State took its first lead of the night when Freddie Dilione V called his own number on a drive to the basket for his second basket of the night.</p>\n                <p>Met with contact, Dilione was gifted a trip to the charity stripe and took advantage to put the Nittany Lions up 20-19.</p>\n                <p>Consecutive Wildcat misses from right under the basket gave the Nittany Lions a golden opportunity to dig into their 35-30 deficit, but a failed Kayden Mingo driving layup put an end to those hopes.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern immediately capitalized and grabbed onto a seven-point lead after a Tre Singleton close-range make. Singleton, averaging 7.6 points per game, was up to nine points against the blue and white with three minutes to play in the first half.</p>\n                <p>Shooting 59% from the field and out-rebounding Penn State 13-10, the Wildcats held a slim 41-39 lead at the two-minute media timeout.</p>\n                <p>Despite Northwestern holding the lead for nearly nine-and-a-half minutes longer than the blue and white, it was still anyone\u2019s game with the first half winding down.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u010b knocked down an and-one for Penn State\u2019s 10th free throw in as many attempts, as well as his ninth point of the game, after getting fouled on his way to the basket to make it a 41-40 game in the late stages of the half.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back Nick Martinelli baskets were the only remaining bit of action in the first half, and the Wildcats left their home court for the halftime break holding a 45-40 advantage, though the Nittany Lions felt they were within reach of their first conference win.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got on the board first in the second half with Reed making just one of two free throws.</p>\n                <p>Shortly after, Mingo poked the rock out, picking up a steal, but getting fouled on the shot, which ended up being a beneficial foul for the Wildcats as Mingo could only convert one of two from the charity stripe. Mingo\u2019s miss was just Penn State\u2019s second of the night from the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>A Dilione turnover led to a two-handed slam from Angelo Ciaravino off the fast break, as the Wildcats seized a 55-44 lead, followed by a discombobulated Penn State taking a timeout.</p>\n                <p>A mid-range Martinelli jumper gave him his 24th point of the night and a personal milestone \u2013 his 17th 20-plus point performance this season, the most in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern\u2019s 13-point lead faded into a 60-53 edge after back-to-back scores from Reed, followed by an unassisted Mingo score, capitalizing on a Wildcat turnover.</p>\n                <p>A big slam from Juri\u010b was the final score of Penn State\u2019s run after Northwestern snapped it with a Singleton basket that was followed by a Ciaravino three-pointer.</p>\n                <p>With just over nine minutes left to play, back-to-back Mingo makes from the charity stripe made it a 67-61 Wildcat lead, but Martinelli quickly called his own name once more on the and-one as he moved up to 27 points on the night.</p>\n                <p>Consecutive blue and white turnovers led to Northwestern\u2019s largest lead of the night, as the Wildcats grabbed a 76-61 advantage with just about six minutes to play, not fully closing the door, but feeling pretty comfortable against a Nittany Lion team that was in the midst of a three-minute scoring drought.</p>\n                <p>Martinelli moved up to 32 points after three-consecutive free-throw makes on different possessions, putting him just two points away from his career-high 34 points that he set against Rutgers earlier this year.</p>\n                <p>Northwestern just kept hammering away to make sure its lead would be insurmountable, as it commanded an 84-66 lead with just over three minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>On the way to nailing the coffin shut, Martinelli matched his career-high thanks to the help of a season-high of four three-point makes.</p>\n                <p>The action may have stopped there for Martinelli, but not the rest of the Wildcats, as Ciaravino went over 20 points and a couple more three-pointers went in on the way to a 94-73 Northwestern victory.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Entering Thursday\u2019s game, Tibor Mirti\u010d was listed as \u201cquestionable,\u201d rehabbing a knee injury, but he did not play against Northwestern.</p>\n                <p>Sa\u015ba Ciani was also missing from action against the Wildcats, listed as \u201cout,\u201d with an \u201cundisclosed injury.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action when it hosts Minnesota this Sunday at the Bryce Jordan Center in the first game of February.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions look to snap their 8-game losing streak against the 10-11 Golden Gophers.

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>After eager anticipation from the Happy Valley faithful, Penn State\u2019s 2026 schedule has been released, marking the first slate of games where Matt Campbell will be leading the Nittany Lions from the sidelines.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 2026 schedule:9/5: Marshall9/12: Temple (Lincoln Financial Field)9/19: Buffalo9/26: Wisconsin10/3: @ Northwestern10/10: USC10/17: @ Michigan10/24: Bye10/31: Purdue11/7: @ Washington11/14: Minnesota11/21: Rutgers11/27: @ Maryland&mdash; Lyle Alenstein (@LAlenstein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LAlenstein/status/2016287433701138745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>Here is what you need to know about the schedule.</p>\n                <p>Favorable nonconference slate</p>\n                <p>Penn State starts the season once again with a trio of nonconference opponents. All three of the games will be played in Pennsylvania, with two of them being at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>Those opponents will be Marshall, Temple and Buffalo. When the Nittany Lions face the Thundering Herd and the Bulls, it\u2019ll be in State College. In Week 2, they\u2019ll travel to Lincoln Financial Field, also the home of the Philadelphia Eagles, to play the Owls.</p>\n                <p>In 2025, all three squads boasted a 5-7 record, making Penn State likely a way-too-early favorite by a comfortable margin in every matchup.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will see familiar faces when they face Temple, as quarterback Jaxon Smolik, tight end Joey Schlaffer, safety Kolin Dinkins and defensive tackle Kaleb Artis all transferred to the Owls following the 2025 season.</p>\n                <p>The idea of facing lower-level FBS and FCS programs for Power Four conferences will likely be a trend for the foreseeable future, as schools will want to minimize losses in pursuit of a College Football Playoff appearance.</p>\n                <p>Toughest stretch</p>\n                <p>Weeks 6 and 7 will be the toughest stretch of games for the Nittany Lions, hosting USC and traveling to Michigan in consecutive weeks.</p>\n                <p>During the 2025-26 campaign, both sides boasted a 9-4 record, finishing right next to each other in the final AP Poll of the year, as the Trojans were No. 20 and the Wolverines were No. 21. Both teams lost in the postseason, as USC fell to TCU in the Alamo Bowl while Michigan dropped the Citrus Bowl to Texas.</p>\n                <p>Both teams bring back their star quarterbacks, with USC returning Jayden Maiva and Michigan bringing back Bryce Underwood. There also are some changes, as the Trojans lost defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn to Penn State for the same role while the Wolverines replaced head coach Sherrone Moore with Kyle Whittingham from Utah.</p>\n                <p>The game\u2019s on Oct. 10, so there\u2019s a good chance the USC game is the White Out with it being at the midway point of the season and the Trojans being the best opponent up to that point. On the other hand, a road game at Michigan Stadium is a daunting environment, as the atmosphere \u201cthe Big House\u201d creates is up there for one of the best in college football.</p>\n                <p>Overall</p>\n                <p>On paper, Penn State has a pretty easy schedule, but as the 2025 season indicated, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be a breeze.</p>\n                <p>The expectation this past season was the only regular season losses for the Nittany Lions could\u2019ve been Oregon and Ohio State. Instead, it resulted in a six-loss, spiraling season.</p>\n                <p>With that being said, the only matchups that present a notable challenge on paper in 2026 are USC and Michigan.</p>\n                <p>An argument can be made for Washington as well, as Penn State will make the cross-country trip to face the Huskies for the first time on the road since they joined the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Still, the makeup of the roster shows this, as of January, is a team that should be able to win football games. With no Indiana, Ohio State or Oregon on the schedule, and Purdue, Rutgers and Maryland on it, the slate gives Campbell an opportunity to cash in on an easier schedule in Year 1 at the helm.</p>\n                <p>With that being said, the talent on the roster has to gel together for the schedule to work out in Penn State\u2019s favor. The makeup of the roster is those coming transferring in from 8-4 Iowa State, players who stuck around from a 7-6 Penn State and an assortment of recruits and other transfers.</p>\n                <p>If the roster can find its chemistry come August, the 2026 group of games should have Campbell leading the Nittany Lions to a winning record in comfortable fashion next year.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State opens up its 2026 campaign with a loaded nonconference schedule that lasts over a span of 26 games before it faces its first Big Ten opponent. Last season, the Nittany Lions finished 25-27 and 10-12 in nonconference play.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white dug itself into an early hole in its 2025 campaign, recording just one win in five nonconference games at the NFCA Leadoff Classic. Blue and white head coach Clarisa Crowell\u2019s squad looks to come out hot this season and pick up key wins before conference play begins on March 13 against Oregon.</p>\n                <p>NFCA Leadoff Classic</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions travel to Clearwater, Florida, for a slate of games against Missouri, Boston College, Eastern Kentucky, BYU and Auburn.</p>\n                <p>The season kicks off against Missouri on Feb. 6, and while the Tigers finished last in the SEC in 2025, they could still be a tough opponent to begin the new campaign. Despite Penn State having the highest ERA in the Big Ten in 2025 at 5.76, the Tigers struggle behind the plate.</p>\n                <p>Missouri finished last in its conference in many major offensive categories, including batting average, runs, hits and RBIs. Additionally, junior Bridget Nemeth returns to the pitching staff after an injury ended her season, after she faced just four batters.</p>\n                <p>With just one returner from last year\u2019s rotation, sophomore Abigail Britton, it\u2019s important for this new pitching staff to come out hot against a rocky offensive team.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions then take on Boston College and Eastern Kentucky. The blue and white should be favored in both of these matchups, but the Colonels could be difficult. They finished with a 38-16 record last season and are an ASUN powerhouse.</p>\n                <p>The key to a victory over Eastern Kentucky is shutting down star junior Kennedy Drafton. The Pearland, Texas, native had an excellent 2025 campaign, posting a .356 average with 52 hits and 45 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>Following that matchup, Penn State takes on a good BYU squad. The Cougars were on the cusp of reaching the NCAA Tournament, but fell just short after a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, BYU finished 32-17 and was one of the best offensive teams in the conference with the third-best batting average at .308.</p>\n                <p>The opening slate of games wraps up against Auburn, which finished hot after a rocky start to last season. The Tigers made it all the way to the NCAA regionals before falling to Florida State.</p>\n                <p>Houston/HCU Invitational</p>\n                <p>Penn State hits the road again to Houston, Texas, for games against Incarnate Word, Houston, Lafayette, Houston Christian and Pitt. This is a favorable part of the schedule for the Nittany Lions as they should have the upper hand in all the contests.</p>\n                <p>Houston finished last in the Big 12 in 2025 at 22-25 and was bounced in the first round of its conference tournament against BYU. However, the squad has new leadership after the Cougars fired its coach, Kristin Vesely, after nine seasons.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white conclude the invitational against interstate rival Pitt. The Panthers finished at 20-32 in 2025, but one of the bright spots of their rough campaign was a 16-8 win over the Nittany Lions in Happy Valley. Penn State needs to limit Pitt\u2019s offense in its matchup for a chance at redemption.</p>\n                <p>SPACEU Classic</p>\n                <p>The next group of games takes the Nittany Lions to Orlando, Florida, for games against Charleston Southern, UCF, Ohio and Notre Dame.</p>\n                <p>Penn State should hold steady against most of these squads, but UCF will be a true test. The Knights finished as one of the top teams after reaching the NCAA Regional Final.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s bats will be challenged by UCF\u2019s dominant pitching staff, who finished with the fourth-best ERA in the Big 12 in 2025 at 3.07. Sophomore Isabelle Vega had a breakout freshman campaign, with an excellent 1.70 ERA and 110 strikeouts.</p>\n                <p>Tennessee Invitational</p>\n                <p>February concludes with matchups against NC Central, Tennessee and Appalachian State in Knoxville, Tennessee. Two games against the talented Volunteers highlight this round of games.</p>\n                <p>Tennessee finished as a top-eight team in the nation after plowing through multiple tough opponents and reaching the Women\u2019s College World Series semifinals, where it lost to SEC foe Texas. The Volunteers are a complete team, and it showed with their 47-17 record and dominance on both sides of the field.</p>\n                <p>If Penn State pulls off the upset, then it will earn much praise from the softball world and put the program on notice.</p>\n                <p>Penn State Softball Invitational</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions head back to Happy Valley for their opening home slate against Lehigh, Binghamton, Colgate and Niagara. This should be a successful series of games for Penn State, as they are favored in all matchups.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have won against Lehigh in its last two games against the Bald Eagles, so its home opener should likely end in a victory.</p>\n                <p>Oregon State</p>\n                <p>Penn State travels cross-country and ends its early nonconference play at Oregon State on March 11. The Beavers finished at 24-23 in the West Coast last season and boast a 4-0 record against the Nittany Lions this millennium.</p>\n                <p>The last matchup between the two teams was in 2014 when Oregon State defeated Penn State 12-10 in a neutral site.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have two more nonconference games, Bucknell and Saint Francis, later in the season, but both matchups are winnable.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s essential for Crowell\u2019s squad to pull off some upsets and win the favorable matchups before entering play in a tough conference.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s hockey plans on fully transforming Happy Valley into Hockey Valley this weekend with arguably the most widely anticipated regular season series in program history, as the No. 2 Michigan State Spartans travel to State College Friday and Saturday.</p>\n                <p>All eyes on the outside</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s contest will take place inside of Beaver Stadium, the first men\u2019s hockey game to take place in the historic football venue. The gravitas of the event has drawn the eyes of the national media to this top-five matchup with attention that regular-season college hockey doesn\u2019t usually receive.</p>\n                <p>Reporters who typically focus on the National Hockey League, including Barstool\u2019s Paul Bissonette, are gathering around the game as a prototype for an NHL Winter Classic taking place in Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has played in just one outdoor game up to this point, coming last season at Wrigley Field\u2019s Frozen Confines, where it tied Notre Dame and lost the shootout. Michigan State has played in multiple outdoor games during its history, including the Frozen Confines. The Spartans are 2-2-2 all time in outdoor games.</p>\n                <p>Temperatures for the game are expected to feature a wind chill well below zero degrees Fahrenheit. Both benches will be heated to keep players warm while off the ice. Fans attending the game can enjoy \u201cwarming zones\u201d around the east side of Penn State\u2019s campus, as well as hot beverages sold inside Beaver Stadium to combat the frigid temperatures.</p>\n                <p>While Saturday\u2019s game is expecting over 60,000 fans in attendance, Friday\u2019s game should push for the all-time attendance record at Pegula Ice Arena. With fans coming to town early, the smaller venue has a get-in price of over $50 for standing room only tickets as of Thursday morning.</p>\n                <p>The hype centers around the star power on display as well as the scenery, with Gavin McKenna, Jackson Smith and Aiden Fink going up against Porter Martone, Cayden Lindstrom and Trey Augustine. These top prospects will be the focus of the national media throughout this top-five series.</p>\n                <p>Battle scars</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions traveled to East Lansing in early November and suffered two losses at the hands of the green-and-white. The first game was a closely contested overtime loss, but game two was an embarrassing disaster for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white lost 5-0 in an embarrassing loss that was highlighted by multiple line brawls and egregious penalties. The game marked Josh Fleming\u2019s worst game of the season and saw the offense unable to compete against a Michigan State defense that was overpowering.</p>\n                <p>Since that game, Penn State made a focus to find an identity and to control its emotions on the ice. Both of those plans have come to fruition in the second half, as Penn State is in the midst of a seven-game winning streak. Stars like McKenna and Fink have started showing the offensive prowess they were hyped upon when they arrived to begin the campaign. The trajectory is similar to last year\u2019s Nittany Lions, with more success for the groundwork than the nearly winless stretch Happy Valley witnessed in 2024.</p>\n                <p>Michigan State has been at the top of the nation throughout the year, led by Martone and Augustine. Martone, the Flyers' most recent first-round pick, sits at 28 points on the year, while Augustine holds a 1.73 goal-against-average and a .938 save percentage.</p>\n                <p>Series History</p>\n                <p>Historically, the Spartans are the Nittany Lions\u2019 closest rival. The series sits at 22-22-8 entering this weekend. The visitors hold the recent advantage, leading the series 8-2-4 since 2022, including a 4-0-1 mark in the last five matchups at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Ben Schoen\u2019s eight points pace every current Nittany Lion in points against Michigan State, while Aiden Fink leads with five goals. Fink missed November\u2019s series due to injury.</p>\n                <p>The series renews at 6 p.m. Friday at Pegula Ice Arena and 1 p.m. Saturday at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>MORE WINTER SPORTS WEEKEND COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Column | Who\u2019ll step up in net for No. 7 Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse with goalie Jack Fracyon graduated?",
    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State goaltender Jack Fracyon started between the pipes for three years, and when a mainstay netminder graduates, it can be difficult to fill the gap left behind. The Nittany Lions are in one such situation.</p>\n                <p>Coach Jeff Tambroni has four options for who\u2019ll step into the starting role: senior Will Mitchell, junior Ben Johnson, redshirt freshman Hayes Schreiner and true freshman Preston Hawkins.</p>\n                <p>1. Ben Johnson</p>\n                <p>Johnson, a junior out of Peoria, Illinois, was the only backup goaltender to appear in action last year, with Fracyon playing nearly the entire season. He entered the crease on two separate occasions, playing the closing minutes in a pair of games.</p>\n                <p>His first outing was against Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, where he didn\u2019t face a shot in his little time in between the pipes. In his second game against Robert Morris, where he made three saves on five shots in the fourth quarter, Penn State won 22-8.</p>\n                <p>Johnson played in three games as a freshman, making two saves on four shots in that season. After seeing no shots against Navy, Johnson saw two shots against Cornell and Maryland each, where he made one save in both games. His appearance against the Terrapins, leading to a 19-9 victory, was also his first and only postseason experience, as it was the Big Ten semifinals.</p>\n                <p>Having experience at the collegiate level is valuable when having to choose the next starter. Johnson, being the only one with that experience, appears to be a shoo-in to fill Fracyon\u2019s role to start the season.</p>\n                <p>2. Hayes Schreiner</p>\n                <p>Schreiner is my second choice for who I believe would inherit Fracyon\u2019s crease. While he\u2019s yet to make his debut at the collegiate level, the Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, native\u2019s bright future can be summed up by his high school resume and his family\u2019s prestige.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt freshman was a four-star recruit via Inside Lacrosse, having played all four years of his high school lacrosse career on the Chestnut Hill Academy varsity team and being named the captain in his senior season. There, he set the all-time school record for most saves in a career.</p>\n                <p>Schreiner\u2019s noteworthy performance earned him various honors in 2023, including being named to the All-State, All-Philly and All-Inter-Academic teams.</p>\n                <p>Looking deeper into his history with the sport, it\u2019s apparent that Schreiner comes from a \u201clacrosse family.\u201d His father, Todd, a graduate of Lehigh and also a goalie, was drafted in the seventh round by the Rochester Rattlers in the 2002 Major Lacrosse League (MLL) draft. Hayes\u2019 mother, Katie, played lacrosse at Washington College.</p>\n                <p>Should Tambroni place his trust in the young netminder, and Schreiner perform aptly, he\u2019ll presumably have a long-term goalie on his hands. Someone who\u2019s able to produce for three or four years in a row, like Fracyon.</p>\n                <p>And in lacrosse, stability between the pipes can\u2019t be ignored.</p>\n                <p>3. Preston Hawkins</p>\n                <p>Hawkins, while being the youngest of the four, is far from out of the running. It\u2019s rather uncommon for true freshmen to receive playing time due to a lack of collegiate experience or simply because of how the older netminders fit into the current system.</p>\n                <p>However, Hawkins\u2019 background suggests that he\u2019ll be ready to compete with Johnson and Schreiner for the starting role.</p>\n                <p>Hawkins, a Powell, Ohio, native, was rated a four-star recruit by Inside Lacrosse as well as the 96th best goaltender in the Class of 2025. He committed to Penn State back in 2023 and remained loyal.</p>\n                <p>Like Schreiner, Hawkins also holds his high school\u2019s record for most career saves, and he did so in his junior year at Worthington Kilbourne High School.</p>\n                <p>His long list of high school awards includes a trio of consecutive conference championships, back-to-back First-Team All-State honors, being named a USA Lacrosse All-American, and the Ohio Goalie of the Year award.</p>\n                <p>It may be worth testing Hawkins in goal against an unranked opponent, or playing him in the fourth quarter of a blowout, to see where his baseline collegiate capabilities are before his maturity rises over the course of his career.</p>\n                <p>4. Will Mitchell</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s Mitchell\u2019s senior season, and the Matthews, North Carolina, native hasn\u2019t touched the field throughout his collegiate career, serving as a depth piece behind Fracyon.</p>\n                <p>Despite not seeing action so far at Penn State, Mitchell\u2019s veteran wisdom brings a new skill set: mentoring.</p>\n                <p>Being the oldest of the goalies, someone who\u2019s \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d in terms of the daily life of a student athlete, he\u2019s able to provide the younger goalies like Schreiner and Hawkins, as well as other incoming recruits, with knowledge.</p>\n                <p>However, it\u2019s hard to argue against seniority being at play when it comes down to the \u201cgarbage minutes\u201d at the end of a blowout victory or defeat. Tambroni may elect to throw Mitchell a bone and give him the time in goal that he\u2019s dreamt of for the past three years over someone like Schreiner or Hawkins, who\u2019ll have more opportunities as they grow older.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Staff predictions | How does Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse shape up against the gauntlet of schedule?",
    "author": "The Daily Collegian Men's Lacrosse Staff",
    "description": "<p>After narrowly falling to Cornell in the 2025 NCAA semifinals, Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse enters 2026 with a reloaded roster and renewed opportunity to make a deep postseason run.</p>\n                <p>Although it won\u2019t be an easy path for the Nittany Lions, as they\u2019re presented with a difficult stretch of both Big Ten and nonconference ranked foes. One question looms: how do they stack up entering this stretch?</p>\n                <p>AJ Piazza: 9-3</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s coming off a Final Four run and could potentially make its third run in four years if things go right this season. I believe Penn State will start off its season hot with wins against Colgate and Villanova, but then take a loss to No. 2 Princeton on the road.</p>\n                <p>I think the Nittany Lions will bounce back against Navy and Yale, continue to build momentum, and defeat big opponents in No. 4 Cornell and No. 6 North Carolina before the squad enters Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>As the blue and white enter the Big Ten play, I believe it will lose to No. 1 Maryland as its last loss of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>I think Penn State will end the year on a four-game win streak: No. 10 Ohio State, No. 15 Johns Hopkins, No. 20 Michigan and No. 18 Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>Andrew Mercer: 9-3</p>\n                <p>I wholeheartedly believe that Penn State will win the games against unranked opponents, Colgate, Villanova, Navy and Yale. The Nittany Lions aren\u2019t in a position to fall in upset defeats, as every game counts that much more when you\u2019re proving that the Final Four run wasn\u2019t just a fluke.</p>\n                <p>I think that the Nittany Lions\u2019 only conference loss will be to No. 1 Maryland. The Terrapins are a tough team every year and historically have Penn State\u2019s number. Last season, Maryland took down the Nittany Lions twice, once in the regular season and then in the Big Ten semifinals.</p>\n                <p>I also have Penn State losing to No. 4 Cornell and No. 2 Princeton. The Big Red were the ones to defeat the Nittany Lions in the National Semifinals last year; history is on Cornell\u2019s side. Secondly, the Big Red are the defending national champions, and it\u2019s hard to argue against the hardware that coach Connor Buczek and company have earned.</p>\n                <p>As for the Tigers, Penn State and Princeton met once last season inside Holuba Hall. It was a different environment, yes, with weather being a non-factor and the Tigers ended up defeating the blue and white in overtime.</p>\n                <p>The rest I have noted down in my \u201cwin column.\u201d I have to admit, No. 6 North Carolina and the defending Big Ten champions, No. 10 Ohio State, will be tough games, but I believe that Penn State has the tools to emerge with both victories.</p>\n                <p>Elliott Inscho: 8-4</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions should start the season off strong with wins over Colgate and Villanova, two teams that they defeated handily last season. The first bump in the road for the blue and white will be against No. 2 Princeton. However, I think they\u2019ll fail to avenge last season\u2019s overtime loss to the Tigers.</p>\n                <p>Navy and Yale should also be relatively easy wins for Penn State, putting them at 4-1 when reigning national champion No. 4 Cornell comes into Happy Valley on March 7.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions split their outings with the Big Red in 2025, winning in the regular season but losing the more notable NCAA semifinal. I think the pattern continues in 2026, and Penn State gets a big-time win over Cornell to bring their record to 5-1.</p>\n                <p>I think they\u2019ll then lose two straight games, to No. 6 North Carolina and No. 1 Maryland, but get back on track in a rivalry matchup with No. 10 Ohio State in Columbus.</p>\n                <p>While, to this point, I've only seen the Nittany Lions lose to higher-ranked teams, I think they\u2019re bound to be upset at least once. I see them losing one of the last three to either No. 15 Johns Hopkins, No. 20 Michigan or No. 18 Rutgers.</p>\n                <p>At 8-4 overall and 3-2 in Big Ten play, it won\u2019t be the strongest season in recent memory, but the blue and white will be in a solid position to make noise in the postseason.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Keira Albert | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 14 Penn State has a chance to put a stop to its two-game losing streak this weekend, as it prepares to face No. 3 Hawai\u2019i.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will come back to Rec Hall this weekend to face Hawai\u2019i at 6 p.m. Friday for the White Out match and 5 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white enter this contest after a tough weekend against then-No. 15 McKendree, where it was swept, resulting in its first two losses of the 2026 season.</p>\n                <p>After previously sitting at No. 10, the Nittany Lions have shifted down four places this week as they prepare for their next ranked matchup.</p>\n                <p>With Hawai\u2019i at 7-1 thus far, and being only the third-ranked opponent for the blue and white this season, it will be a tougher match.</p>\n                <p>Hawai\u2019i has had a strong start to the year, suffering only one loss to Loyola Chicago earlier this season. It has remained within the top 3 in every AVCA Poll since the season began, and it hasn\u2019t lost a match since Jan. 9.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white haven\u2019t had the best of luck against the Rainbow Warriors. Last season, Penn State lost both matches against Hawai\u2019i, including a season-ending loss in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>While Hawai\u2019i comes into this contest hot and with the odds in its favor, it will be the first road trip of the year for the squad, heading to the Commonwealth with a clash against Robert Morris first.</p>\n                <p>Despite the two losses Penn State took this weekend, it hasn\u2019t been all bad.</p>\n                <p>Sean Harvey has been a key piece to the blue and white\u2019s squad so far this year. With 71 kills on the season, the redshirt sophomore ranks No. 32 in the NCAA in kills per set and is second on the Penn State squad in the same category.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s not the only standout, though.</p>\n                <p>Ryan Merk ranks No. 11 in the NCAA in digs this week, with 52 on the year. The libero was also named EIVA Defensive Player of the Week ahead of the matchup, making him a huge threat on the court.</p>\n                <p>However, there are some notable struggles. Serving seems to be a challenge for the Nittany Lions, especially when compared to the opposition.</p>\n                <p>Hawai\u2019i\u2019s Justin Todd has 11 service aces on the year, leading the Rainbow Warriors and ranking No. 32 in the NCAA in aces per set. As a team, Hawai\u2019i is currently ranked No. 16 in the same category.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s Owen Rose has eight service aces on the year to lead the Nittany Lions, but doesn\u2019t currently rank in the top 50 in the NCAA in aces per set. When compared to Hawai\u2019i\u2019s ranking in that category, the blue and white squad trails far behind, tied at No. 29.</p>\n                <p>The Hawai\u2019i defense also looks solid. In fact, 6-foot-11 setter Tread Rosenthal currently leads the Rainbow Warriors with 21 blocks, ranking him 31st in the NCAA in blocks per set.</p>\n                <p>But Penn State has some stars of its own.</p>\n                <p>Gaige Gabriel has 20 blocks so far, and currently sits tied at 44th in the NCAA in blocks per set. Again, Rose leads the Nittany Lions with 23 blocks, ranking him 26th in the NCAA in blocks per set, five places above Rosenthal.</p>\n                <p>It does seem that Hawai\u2019i has the better odds. All time, the Rainbow Warriors are 19-10 against the Nittany Lions. While they\u2019ve only played in University Park once before, Hawai\u2019i won that match.</p>\n                <p>Both teams have a lot to play for this weekend, as Hawai\u2019i looks to keep its winning streak alive, and the Nittany Lions look to pick their streak back up in the ranked matchup.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>This weekend, No. 4 Penn State will play a major role in the first-ever \u201cWinter Sports Weekend\u201d in historic fashion when it hosts the first-ever outdoor game in Penn State history. The Nittany Lions will host the Robert Morris Colonials.</p>\n                <p>Game 1 of the series will be at 1 p.m. on Friday at Beaver Stadium, with Game 2 at 6 p.m. on Saturday at Pegula Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>This will be the second matchup of the season between these two teams after they first met on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 of 2025. Penn State took both games with a 4-0 score as goaltender Katie DeSa recorded back-to-back shutouts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is 16-24-8 all time against Robert Morris and has won the last six games played between the two.</p>\n                <p>Recent records</p>\n                <p>The blue and white will walk through the gates of Beaver Stadium on the heels of a five-game win streak and are 7-2-1 in its last 10 games. The Nittany Lions currently sit atop the AHA standings with a 17-1 record, giving them 52 points.</p>\n                <p>As for the Colonials, they have dropped each of their last four contests and are 5-5 in their last 10 games. With a 6-10-2 conference record, they sit sixth in the standings with 21 points on the year.</p>\n                <p>Scoring centers</p>\n                <p>Centering the top line for the red, white and blue is Jessica MacKinnon, the team\u2019s top scorer. In 28 games, MacKinnon has recorded 13 goals and 16 assists for 29 points. Her goal and point totals rank her fifth in the conference in both categories.</p>\n                <p>In the faceoff circle, MacKinnon has the most wins in the conference with 375 and a faceoff win-rate of 61.5%, the third most in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Who she\u2019ll face up against is still to be determined, with Penn State\u2019s first-line center position needing to be filled with the absence of captain Tessa Janecke, who has begun her preparations for the Winter Olympics.</p>\n                <p>One likely candidate to fill that position is winger Grace Outwater. Next to Janecke, Outwater is the team's second-highest scorer. She is second in the conference to Janecke in goals with 18, and third in points with 30.</p>\n                <p>Another option for coach Jeff Kampersal is McKenna Walsh. The freshman forward went 8-for-11 in the faceoff circle in the series against Delaware.</p>\n                <p>Rookie energy</p>\n                <p>This series also brings a matchup between a top group of rookies.</p>\n                <p>Playing on a line with Outwater and Maddy Christian is freshman Mikah Keller. With a goal and two assists in two games against Delaware, Keller tied for the most freshman points over the weekend, earning her honors as the AHA Rookie of the Week.</p>\n                <p>On the year, Keller has seven goals and 18 assists for 25 points, with five points in her last four games.</p>\n                <p>Manning the blue line for the Colonials is Linnea Misner, a freshman from Springfield, Manitoba.</p>\n                <p>A two-time AHA Rookie of the Week this season, Misner has put up four goals and 13 assists in 28 games. Her 17 points are the fourth-most among the team and the most for a defenseman.</p>\n                <p>Goaltending probables</p>\n                <p>After recording a new Penn State record 21 shutouts, DeSa will most likely get the nod for the blue and white in Friday\u2019s outdoor game. This season, the Pawcatuck, Connecticut, native is 18-2 with a conference-best .933 save percentage and a 1.26 goals-against-average, the third lowest in the nation.</p>\n                <p>With DeSa making just two starts since leaving with an injury during a Jan. 2 game against Ohio State, it is possible Kampersal could still ease her back into consistent play.</p>\n                <p>This would mean a potential start by Maddy Campbell, who set a women\u2019s hockey program record with her fourth shutout of the season, the most by a freshman goaltender. She is 6-2 with a .935 save percentage and a 1.44 goals-against-average.</p>\n                <p>Across the ice from DeSa, it is expected that Maggie Hatch will be between the pipes for Robert Morris. She made her most recent start last Friday against Mercyhurst and surrendered five goals in roughly 50 minutes before being pulled for redshirt sophomore Lucy Phillips.</p>\n                <p>Hatch is 8-10-2 with a .927 save percentage, 2.24 goals-against-average and five shutouts this season.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you're worrying about whether or not your resum\u00e9 is going to get you that dream internship, or you're stuck staring silently at the blank page in front of you, hoping words will magically appear for the essay you have due next week, the Writing Center @ Penn State Learning is here to help.</p>\n                <p>Located in both Boucke 220 and W102 Pattee, the tutors at the Writing Center are prepared to support you in any of your writing endeavors. The Writing Center offers drop-ins and appointment hours with sign-ups on Starfish and is free to all Penn State undergraduate students at the University Park campus.</p>\n                <p>Although it can be nerve-racking to have your writing read over by another student, the center is a judgment-free zone, and the tutors encourage anyone who needs help to check it out.</p>\n                <p>Kennedy Jones, a peer writing tutor, endorses this sentiment and wants anyone who comes into the center to feel welcome. In order to make all students feel comfortable, she eases them into the process by asking them about how their day is going or topics they\u2019re interested in.</p>\n                <p>\"It gives me more time to know them on a personal level before we start reading,\" Jones, a third-year studying journalism said.</p>\n                <p>According to Jones, she assists students with various essays from English 15: Rhetoric and Composition to projects in higher-level classes with the goal of guiding them to better, more structured pieces.</p>\n                <p>Jones said she learned about the program from her own English 15 professor, gave it a shot and ended up loving it.</p>\n                <p>\"It makes me happy to know that I can help students become more confident in their own writing and their own voice,\" Jones said.</p>\n                <p>To become a tutor, students have to enroll in a class \u2014 English 250: Peer Tutoring in Writing \u2014 where they learn how to become a tutor and revise writing effectively. The class also consists of a writing practicum with an experienced peer tutor mentor.</p>\n                <p>The process to join the class begins when students fill out an application to take the course, which is posted on the Penn State Learning website. After passing the class, students can be hired by the center.</p>\n                <p>Tabitha Fisher, the writing center coordinator, oversees the program and is the direct supervisor for all of the undergraduate peer writing tutors. She said the process is rigorous so the student tutors are equipped to help for many different academic writing needs.</p>\n                <p>\"We're here to facilitate conversations about writing and with writers to help them make independent decisions about the direction they want their writing to go,\" Fisher said. \"We work with writing in and outside of the classroom, so we work with a lot of upper-level writing courses as well, and things like resum\u00e9s, grad school applications, cover letters and personal writing.\"</p>\n                <p>Fisher said the center also hopes to serve the peer tutors themselves by providing an ethical employment model and prioritizing their professional development.</p>\n                <p>She also said the tutoring sessions work outside of the traditional model, with instead of having the tutor sit and read the work the writer brings in, the process is much more collaborative, centering the writer as the agent.</p>\n                <p>Usually, the process starts with the writer asking the tutor questions or looking at the assignment sheet together. Next, the tutor has the writer read their paper out loud, as a technique to help the writer catch things they may have missed in their first read through.</p>\n                <p>From there, the rest of the time focuses on the writer's objectives and what they specifically want to get done or are struggling with during the session, encouraging writers to understand that what they think is important to the tutors too.</p>\n                <p>Fisher said coming in for a tutoring session doesn't mean you struggle with writing \u2014 strong writers seek out assistance too.</p>\n                <p>\"This is a thing you do when you care a lot about your writing,\" Fisher said. \"Don't feel like you're stupid or a bad writer because you're thinking about seeking help.\"</p>\n                <p>Fisher is especially proud of the tutors in the program and said they are \"just so lovely.\"</p>\n                <p>\"I love getting the opportunity to work closely with them one-on-one and provide a good model for what a positive, constructive working environment looks like,\" Fisher said. \"I think that's my favorite part.\"</p>\n                <p>Julie Evanchak , a peer writing tutor, said one commonality she noticed among the students she tutors is a lack of confidence in their writing. Because of this, she said a lot of the time she focuses on instilling confidence in her writers, so they can be proud of their work.</p>\n                <p>\"I feel like there's this stigma behind tutoring, especially for students who don't know what it's like to be tutored,\" Evanchak, a second-year studying advertising/public relations, said. \"I like to make it personable and really collaborate together to make the writing better.\"</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Samuel Simonic | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Empty seats. Lost energy. No wins.</p>\n                <p>Penn State men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball have combined for zero wins and 19 losses in Big Ten play. At some point, the underperformance demands more than surface-level explanations.</p>\n                <p>The BJC.</p>\n                <p>While the Bryce Jordan Center isn\u2019t solely responsible for the struggles of Penn State\u2019s basketball programs, the elephant in the room has become difficult to ignore. The venue simply does not suit these programs.</p>\n                <p>For several years, the Nittany Lions and Lady Lions teams have looked like a sinking ship, seeking revitalization. Now, it appears that the ship has hit rock bottom. And the BJC is offering no mercy.</p>\n                <p>The Bryce Jordan Center came into existence with a groundbreaking $55 million cost funded through state and private dollars. On Jan 6, 1996, the arena officially opened, marking a new era in Penn State basketball history.</p>\n                <p>The arena was modeled after NBA venues and featured a total capacity of more than 15,000 seats. As one of the most modern arenas in college basketball, there was a lot to rejoice about in Happy Valley. Besides, the tides were turning.</p>\n                <p>In 1982, Penn State was rejected by the up-and-coming Big East, which voted 5-3 against welcoming the blue and white into its conference. But that very rejection turned out to be what Penn State needed.</p>\n                <p>Because, in 1990, Penn State ushered in a great advance in its athletics. The team accepted an invitation to join the Big Ten conference, leaving the Atlantic 10, to become its eleventh member. This marked a monumental shift in competitiveness as the Nittany Lions had previously sought out a better conference.</p>\n                <p>After all, Penn State had already cemented itself as a football school. In the midst of a widely successful Joe Paterno era, the Nittany Lions\u2019 football program was independent and actively sought to form conference ties with neighboring schools such as Pitt, Syracuse and West Virginia.</p>\n                <p>In hindsight, joining the Big East would\u2019ve surely done no good for a program that had visions of becoming a blue blood. Joining the Big Ten paid dividends in all aspects of Penn State athletics \u2014 more specifically, football.</p>\n                <p>But Penn State hoops was also on the rise, both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Under coach Jerry Dunn, the men\u2019s team plotted one of its most successful seasons prior to the BJC\u2019s opening. In the 1995-96 season, the blue and white posted a 21-7 record and made the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>The women\u2019s team, on the other hand, was beginning to turn into a perennial power. Under coach Rene Portland, the Lady Lions had endured their most successful tenure in program history. Penn State had made the NCAA Tournament in seven-straight seasons and charted seven-straight 20 or more win seasons. Success at its finest.</p>\n                <p>Then the moves were made. From the ornate Rec Hall to the state-of-the-art Bryce Jordan Center, Penn State hoops was in a new era. And, it hasn\u2019t quite shaped out.</p>\n                <p>Since the end of the Dunn era \u2014 which concluded in the early 2000s \u2014 Penn State men\u2019s basketball has only reached the NCAA Tournament twice. Additionally, the team has been ranked in the AP Poll just once.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 men\u2019s program endured five different coaches in this era, including Dunn. All of its seasons have featured double-digit loss totals, with a handful totaling as many as 20 losses.</p>\n                <p>All time, Penn State men\u2019s basketball is 1586-1285-1. Sitting at just above .500, the team is historically subpar. However, the Lady Lions are a different story. Only in recent years has Penn State women\u2019s basketball been that bad.</p>\n                <p>Historically, Penn State women\u2019s basketball has a 879-515 record, which marks a win percentage above .600. In its 45 seasons, the Lady Lions had just three coaches since 1981, including Portland, Coquese Washington and Carolyn Kieger who took over in 2019.</p>\n                <p>The recent woes have come at the grand expense of the Bryce Jordan Center. In the 2025 season, it got so bad that Penn State women\u2019s basketball moved back to Rec Hall to play the majority of its home games.</p>\n                <p>The tipping point came on Thursday, Jan. 22, when the Nittany Lions hosted Wisconsin in their annual game at Rec Hall. In what\u2019s normally a packed crowd at a maximum capacity that seats just over 6,500 people, the ancient arena was not nearly as full.</p>\n                <p>Penn State went on to lose 98-71 as the half-empty arena\u2019s lackluster energy failed to propel a closer game.</p>\n                <p>At this point, Penn State basketball has hit rock bottom. Both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams have become the laughing stock of the Big Ten. What might be playing a larger role in this catastrophe comes behind the scenes.</p>\n                <p>The Bryce Jordan Center is no longer a suitable basketball arena. These programs, unfortunately, require something less. In 2016, ESPN ranked the BJC 14th among the then-14 Big Ten conference schools in terms of the toughest places to play.</p>\n                <p>The article claimed Penn State\u2019s attendance fell just under 7,000 fans per game. That means the Nittany Lions weren\u2019t able to fill half the arena, back then, when the team was at least respectable. One can only wonder what that number looks like now.</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall opened back in 1928 and certainly is not the best of modern arenas. Since the Bryce Jordan Center\u2019s opening, Rec Hall has been used only for gymnastics, volleyball and wrestling.</p>\n                <p>Once the Lady Lions moved back, that marked one of two programs that should\u2019ve been added to the list. The other is Penn State men\u2019s basketball.</p>\n                <p>The Bryce Jordan Center is no longer equipped to house the sport of basketball in Happy Valley. While the venue is suitable, perhaps a change of scenery would benefit all parties involved.</p>\n                <p>Regardless, Penn State has proven it is not a basketball school, and playing in an area like that as if they were one is laughable.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>With Penn State\u2019s season nearing a start, the team has worked on building chemistry in coach Kayla Treanor\u2019s first year.</p>\n                <p>For the attackers, that synergy is already in place, with a majority of last year\u2019s attackers returning for another year. Here\u2019s a look at the Nittany Lions\u2019 current attacking room heading into this season.</p>\n                <p>Returners</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s attackers boast the strongest group of returners, having 10 athletes returning to Happy Valley this year.</p>\n                <p>Leading the charge is senior Erika Ho, who led the Nittany Lions with 46 goals last year. Despite graduating after her junior year, she returned for one more season with the blue and white and will look to be a difference maker in Treanor\u2019s offense.</p>\n                <p>Joining Ho near the top of last year\u2019s returners is Emma Kelly, who started in all but three games last year.</p>\n                <p>The Bethpage, New York, native recorded 20 goals in her junior year, a steady improvement from the year before.</p>\n                <p>After a successful freshman year where she scored 13 goals, attacker Ellie Wisch will seek her first career start as the third-highest-scoring returner from last year.</p>\n                <p>With a little more starting experience, junior Kelly MacKinney returns for Year 3 with 26 career starts. Despite only scoring 12 goals last year, MacKinney led the team in assists, recording 37 dishes for 49 points \u2014 the second-most on the squad.</p>\n                <p>Senior Payton Wainman enters this year as one of the more experienced returners.</p>\n                <p>Wainman played in 33 games in her career, starting 19 of them. The Delray Beach, Florida, native had a standout sophomore season with 12 goals and eight assists in 12 starts, but only scored eight goals with seven assists in her seven starts last year.</p>\n                <p>Delaney Radin stepped up and was a difference-maker for the Nittany Lions last season. After transferring from Florida, Radin scored three goals and two assists in her two starts.</p>\n                <p>After redshirting her freshman year, Minka Martinez made the most of her sole opportunity last year.</p>\n                <p>Martinez saw playing time in the team\u2019s 16-4 victory over Bucknell, where she recorded two assists.</p>\n                <p>Sophomores Porter Rhoades, Grace Tullock and redshirt sophomore Lainey Straub will all look for more playing time as well after appearing in just one contest each last season.</p>\n                <p>Freshmen</p>\n                <p>In a recruiting class of eight freshmen, the attacking group only has two new faces this year.</p>\n                <p>Lizzie Ann\u00e9 joins the Nittany Lions after leading her high school team to Utah Women's 5A State Championships in 2022 and 2024 with a 51-4 career record. Through three years, Ann\u00e9 recorded 98 goals and 53 assists.</p>\n                <p>Former Syracuse commit Rocquette Allen flipped to Penn State after Treanor\u2019s hiring, adding the team\u2019s second 4-star recruit alongside her sister defender Sarah Ann\u00e9.</p>\n                <p>Rocquette Allen fills out the class, ranked the No. 51 athlete in her class and helped lead her club team, Sky Walkers 2025 Blue, to a 20-5 record last year.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>The heavyweight position is a spot that can range from around 200 pounds, all the way to 285 pounds. When deemed a smaller heavyweight, the wrestler has to utilize additional tactics other than size to succeed at the weight class.</p>\n                <p>For Cole Mirasola, he\u2019s focused on his quickness and IQ, while incorporating a mental aspect that has led him to a win streak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like in the past I haven\u2019t really been super mean when I wrestle, just kind of tactical and slick, but talking to coach Cael (Sanderson), you always have to be clean,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cYou can win dirty, like not being dirty, but pulling guys down and focusing on just being mean.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mirasola has implemented a mean aspect to his wrestling that\u2019s propelled him to the next level at the collegiate stage.</p>\n                <p>Entering this season, it was unknown how the redshirt freshman would fully perform. Being an undersized heavyweight, Mirasola showed what could happen against the bigger heavyweight during his redshirt season.</p>\n                <p>While Greg Kerkvliet was nursing an injury in 2025, Mirasola stepped in and faced Ohio State\u2019s Nick Feldman and Illinois\u2019 Luke Luffman. Both matches he was unable to get out from underneath the big wrestlers, proving that size does sometimes matter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s obviously a little bit smaller than the guys he\u2019s wrestling,\u201d Josh Barr said. \u201cBut, I think he just kind of got that chip on his shoulder to go out there and fight guys.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite facing bigger wrestlers, Mirasola has continued to maintain focus, perfecting his craft, but the mentality shifted as the season has gone along.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m trying to focus on being more mean, when I\u2019m wrestling, just kind of not like letting guys get any points easily,\u201d Mirasola said.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola\u2019s confidence in himself has never wavered. Through a two-match losing streak, questions arose from outside the program about the true potential of the heavyweight wrestler. Despite this, he continued to work and continued to believe in himself, becoming more bad-tempered with his approach in the process.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter where we wrestle,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be mean wherever we go.\u201d</p>\n                <p>This mean aspect has struck fear into his teammates, including Barr, who\u2019s attempting to \u201ctry and stay from him\u201d because \u201che\u2019s a mean, tough kid.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He showcased this mentality throughout his latest matches, using that anger to overpower some bigger wrestlers, while keeping steady in his attacks during bouts with wrestlers more of his size.</p>\n                <p>His first test of 2026 came against Iowa\u2019s Ben Kueter, who\u2019s closer to his weight than that of Lehigh\u2019s Nathan Taylor \u2014 who Mirasola lost to earlier in the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCole\u2019s continuing to obviously get better as he competes and his confidence,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola maintained his focus and upset Kueter, proving his capabilities despite this being his first collegiate season as the starter and one of the smaller heavyweights in the country.</p>\n                <p>The toughness and focus showed up in his most recent matchup against Maryland. Mirasola overpowered a heavier Joey Schneck and drove him to the ground multiple times before putting him in a cradle for the fall.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf I wrestle the whole time, I don\u2019t think anyone can really wrestle with me for that whole seven minutes,\u201d Mirasola said. \u201cIf I use my conditioning as a factor, I think that\u2019ll help for sure.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mirasola\u2019s conditioning has pushed him to No. 12 in the InterMat rankings, winning his last seven matches entering the illustrious Bryce Jordan Center dual on Friday against Nebraska. With his first dual season still ongoing, the Jackson, Wisconsin, native is still \u201ckind of actively trying to get the extra calories.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The calorie growth has been a process for Mirasola who\u2019s slowly trying to add on. He\u2019s constantly putting the work in, and slowly adding weight to his already skilled body.</p>\n                <p>After succeeding in his first major test of 2026, Mirasola will face yet another highly ranked wrestler when the Cornhuskers come to town.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019ll take on a similar sized wrestler in AJ Ferrari, who\u2019s jumped weights after competing at 197 pounds last season. Ferrari\u2019s transition to heavyweight has seemingly been much easier, as he\u2019s matched up well against the heavier wrestlers. In his most recent match, he lost in sudden victory to Feldman, giving up just one takedown. His unique style will provide something a little different for the Nittany Lion.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very tactical in the way he wrestles, so very tricky, and it\u2019ll be a fun challenge for Cole,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cObviously you got to wrestle wisely and do what you do to give yourself a chance of success there.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It\u2019ll be a difficult task against Ferrari, who\u2019s showcased he\u2019s one of the best at heavyweight. Despite this, the weight matchup will favor Mirasola, who\u2019s thrived against wrestlers with a similar weigh-in.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a tough kid,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI\u2019m sure coach Cael mentioned that, but he\u2019s just going to get better every single match.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

However, freshman Tea Cleante fired back, tying things up with a 3-pointer of her own.</p>\n                <p>Despite her small height at 5-foot-6, Shaelyn Steele grabbed the Lady Lions\u2019 first defensive rebound of the game and took the ball back up the court for a fast-break jumper.</p>\n                <p>Up 8-5, neither team found any success during a two-minute cold stretch, but the Golden Gophers quickly took back the lead going into the media timeout.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions\u2019 successful start evaporated through the rest of the quarter as they couldn\u2019t get anything to fall, going nearly six minutes without any action while Minnesota went on a 10-0 run.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWith Gracie, we usually have our set package when we\u2019re in empties with her, and so we got to go to different options,\u201d coach Carolyn Kieger said. \u201cWe have to go to different pieces right now to find that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Golden Gophers opened the second quarter with just as much success, as McKinney drained another wide-open triple, followed by a pair of fouls by the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Down by double digits, Penn State attempted to get back in the game from the 3-point line. However, the Lady Lions were shooting just 3-for-11 from deep early on as Kiyomi McMiller and Nyla McFadden went 0-for-8.</p>\n                <p>Similar to the short-lived first quarter success, Penn State got hot midway through the second period, making five straight shots \u2014 four coming from deep.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought we played like a team (in the second quarter),\u201d Kieger said. \u201cI thought we shared the ball well and we were gritty on the defensive end.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McMiller\u2019s quiet start was quickly negated after back-to-back 3-pointers and a jump shot made it a six-point game. Things got even tighter, and even turned to a Lady Lion lead, after more 3-pointers from Cleante, Viktoria Ranisavljevic and Moriah Murray.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ultimately ended the quarter down by four points, but shrank its margin with six 3-pointers in Quarter 2.</p>\n                <p>Both teams battled to open the third quarter, as the Golden Gophers continued their success from deep with Maura Bran\u2019s second triple of the day.</p>\n                <p>Those 3-point battles continued well into the third period as senior Vitoria Santana cut Penn State\u2019s deficit to single digits before Minnesota\u2019s Brylee Glenn gave the Golden Gophers their biggest lead of the day at 12 points.</p>\n                <p>The two teams entered Wednesday\u2019s contest with the most and last turnovers in the Big Ten, with Penn State averaging 18.9 turnovers compared to Minnesota\u2019s 10.6. The results were a little closer when they faced off against each other, with the Lady Lions giving up just 11 turnovers while causing six against Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Another quarter, another 3-pointer as Grace Grocholski earned her spot on the stat sheet to give her team a 15-point lead.</p>\n                <p>Maggie Mendelson quickly found her first basket of the game after shaking a pair of opponents in the paint, followed by McMiller\u2019s 21st point of the day.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe play at our best when we\u2019re sharing the ball,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIn the second half, we didn\u2019t do a great job of getting good shots off and finding an open person.\u201d</p>\n                <p>However, the Golden Gophers continued to do what every Penn State opponent has done in the past month \u2014 extend the lead in the fourth quarter and hand the blue and white another loss.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota ultimately outscored the Lady Lions 10-5 down the final five minutes of action, dropping Penn State to 7-15 on the year and 0-11 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Injury report</p>\n                <p>Gracie Merkle hit the injury report for her second straight game after missing the final two minutes of last Wednesday\u2019s matchup against Washington. Meanwhile, forward Amiya Evans has been out since Jan. 11 despite Kieger hinting at a possible return Wednesday night.</p>\n                <p>Up next</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions will have a much-needed break before traveling to Purdue next Wednesday to take on the Boilermakers at 7 p.m.</p>",

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will face Nebraska at the Bryce Jordan Center for its 20th matchup. Penn State has won the last nine matches against the Cornhuskers and could extend that to 10 as the favorites entering the dual.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a deep dive into the history of the matchups between Penn State and Nebraska.</p>\n                <p>Overall record</p>\n                <p>Penn State has a record of 11-8 against Nebraska. The Nittany Lions have been the better team as of late, while Nebraska won a lot of the early matchups. Penn State has not lost to the Cornhuskers since Cael Sanderson has been at the helm.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska head coach Mark Manning hasn\u2019t been able to get the Cornhuskers over the edge despite bringing in a lot of talent from the transfer portal like heavyweight AJ Ferrari on this year\u2019s roster. Manning will try to lead his team to an upset and its first victory against the Nittany Lions in a long time.</p>\n                <p>Notable all-time matches</p>\n                <p>Last season Penn State dominated Nebraska 31-7. No. 3 Tyler Kasak matched up against No. 5 Antrell Taylor, a matchup we will not see this season. Kasak exploded in the first period, and then it was pretty even until Kasak took over. He secured a takedown, and continued to be in control.</p>\n                <p>The now-junior secured four-near fall points as well to garner a large lead and get the victory, 9-3. Taylor went on later in the season to become a national champion.</p>\n                <p>One of the closest matchups between the two teams was in 2021-22. Penn State got the victory by a touchdown, 21-14. Former Nittany Lion and current assistant coach Nick Lee had a tight match against Chad Red Jr. Lee, who was No. 1 while Red Jr. was No. 8.</p>\n                <p>Lee seemed to be in control of the match despite the low scoring dual. Lee started off hot, but did allow Red Jr to get close, but once he did, Lee got behind him and was awarded two points to take the lead.</p>\n                <p>Lee also got an escape and was awarded an extra point for riding time to take the victory, 4-1. This match got the Nittany Lions the Big Ten regular season title.</p>\n                <p>In 2015-16, Penn State showed its dominance with a 24-10 win. Former wrestler turned UFC fighter Bo Nickal was a part of that dominance. Nickal was the No. 1 wrestler at 174 and wrestled No. 14 Micah Barnes. Nickal was the better wrestler.</p>\n                <p>The match was close for a majority of it. Barnes kept it to a 4-3 score until the later parts of the middle period. Nickal took over after the midway point, securing his third takedown of the match.</p>\n                <p>In the final period Barnes gave Nickal points by stalling. This allowed Nickal to extend his lead and get the decision win 10-3.</p>\n                <p>Last time Nebraska won</p>\n                <p>The last time Nebraska defeated Penn State was in 2008-09 when the Cornhuskers advanced to the NU National Duals semifinals when they defeated the Nittany Lions, 20-14.</p>\n                <p>This match was unique in how the results played out. Penn State won the first four duals, while Nebraska won the last six. At 157 pounds, No. 2 Jordan Burroughs got the first victory for the Cornhuskers and started the momentum for the squad. Burroughs got the 10-4 decision victory over No. 8 Dan Vallimont.</p>\n                <p>The largest victory of the match was at 197. No. 1 Craig Brester got the tech-fall win over Clay Steadman 20-5. The three-time All-American brought his team within reach to defeat Penn State and set up heavyweight Tucker Lane to put his team over the edge.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska had a stronger lineup than Penn State and it showed. Nebraska had eight-ranked wrestlers while Penn State only had two, which allowed the squad to get back in the match and get the victory. Lane sealed the deal with a 4-2 decision victory over Cameron Wade.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Freshman Kayden Mingo is known within Penn State to be mature beyond his years.</p>\n                <p>Mingo sat next to Mike Rhoades on the team bus following the Nittany Lions\u2019 84-78 loss to Ohio State on Monday, and the two broke down the game together. It\u2019s another example of the point guard always wanting to improve, even after shooting 22.2% from the field over the past two games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe takes great ownership in his play, good and bad,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cHe takes great ownership because he wants to get better. So, for a freshman point guard, this is eating at him, too, but he has a great mindset right now, just trying to get better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo made his return from a broken-nose injury in the last three matchups. After totaling 19 points and five assists on 58.3% shooting in his first game back against Maryland, he\u2019s scored just 10 points versus Wisconsin and Ohio State combined.</p>\n                <p>Particularly in the game against the Badgers, Mingo shot 3-of-14 from the field and 0-of-3 from 3-point range. He shot 1-of-4 on field goals versus the Buckeyes, and Rhoades cited opposing squads looking to contain one of Penn State\u2019s \u201cbiggest threats.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cTeams are doing that with Kayden,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI thought (Monday), them changing the defenses and all that stuff, he was more of a facilitator. Then he got going a little bit. He had eight assists. He had too many turnovers, but he had eight assists. He got guys shots. I thought he got into the interior of the zone, and even man to man, and got some guys shots.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mingo averaged two assists for every one turnover throughout Monday\u2019s game. Rhoades highlighted Mingo\u2019s assist to wing Eli Rice for a 3-pointer that kicked off a 27-10 run by the Nittany Lions to open the second half.</p>\n                <p>While playing in these past few games, Mingo wore a facemask due to his injury. After the Maryland game, he said he felt comfortable wearing the mask on the court.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere was an adjustment at the start,\u201d Mingo said Tuesday. \u201cNow, it's starting to get normal. It's definitely not the same as looking straight on without something in your face, but it's what we gotta do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to his injury, which caused him to miss three games, the 4-star prospect was a consistent scorer for Penn State, logging 12 games in double figures out of 14 opportunities. He\u2019s seen just one double-figure performance in his last three games, but with defenses keying in on him, his eight assists against Ohio State are the most he\u2019s had since tallying eight assists versus Michigan State on Dec. 13, which was a personal best.</p>\n                <p>Mingo is averaging 14.0 points, 3.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 2.1 steals per game through 17 appearances during Penn State\u2019s 9-11 start to this season. He\u2019s shooting 46.7% from the field and 23% from 3-point range, which is what Mingo said he wants to improve upon heading into the last 11 games of the regular season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe's 20 games into his career, and we're all expecting so much of him because we need a lot from him,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cBut he's got to ride the wave, too. Some games, he's only gonna have six points and eight assists. Some games, he might get 16 points and four assists, but you got to continue to learn and get better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Usurping Penn State | How can collegiate wrestling catch up to Cael Sanderson\u2019s dynasty?",
    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Cael Sanderson\u2019s Nittany Lions have been the dominant program in the world of college wrestling for the better part of the last two decades. The program has won 12 of the last 14 national championships and are in the midst of the longest-winning streak in NCAA wrestling history.</p>\n                <p>Through changes in the landscape of college sports, no other team has been able to catch up to the dominance of the Nittany Lions. In fact, the current team may be in its best form yet, being the first team ever to have six wrestlers ranked No. 1 at the same time.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will also only lose one member of its starting lineup next year, will add top recruits and senior world champion Masanosuke Ono as well as returning past starters in Aaron Nagao and Tyler Kasak.</p>\n                <p>But dynasties can\u2019t last forever. In an upcoming era that sees the financial landscape of the entire NCAA changing and rules modernizing across the board, what will it take for another program to usurp Penn State as the top dogs in wrestling?</p>\n                <p>Big Ten Network analyst Shane Sparks watches more college wrestling than most of the country and has had a front row seat to see the Nittany Lions throughout this historic run. Despite having seen the entire national landscape of college wrestling, not even he could think of a solution for other programs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to close the gap, but it\u2019s another thing to actually beat (Penn State),\u201d Sparks told the Daily Collegian. \u201cHow does that happen? I don\u2019t have an answer for you.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Teams around the country are trying to innovate in order to reach levels near what is being accomplished inside the Lorenzo Wrestling Complex.</p>\n                <p>Oklahoma State decided to hire out of the Sanderson coaching tree, landing former Penn State wrestler and assistant coach David Taylor prior to last season. To build up his program faster, Taylor utilized the transfer portal heavily, including grabbing former Nittany Lions in Alex Facundo and Zack Ryder to insert into his starting lineup. While the new roster hasn\u2019t been as successful as hoped, Taylor had another trick up his sleeve.</p>\n                <p>The Cowboys landed a commitment from in-state Bishop McCort High School senior Jax Forrest last winter. He decided to enroll early and start competing this semester.</p>\n                <p>While Forrest hasn\u2019t reached his five-dates yet, after he secured a pin in the first minute of his debut, Forrest wrestled attached at the Cyclone Open, where he won the 133-pound weight class. The attachment signals that Forrest will burn his redshirt in order to compete at the NCAA tournament this season.</p>\n                <p>Others, including his former high school teammate and top 2027 recruit Melvin Miller have teased using the same tactic during their senior year.</p>\n                <p>Miller and his brother Bo Bassett are two central Pennsylvania natives from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. After two recruitment cycles, both prospects elected to spurn Penn State, first to commit to the Iowa Hawkeyes, then to Virginia Tech.</p>\n                <p>According to Bassett, Penn State was in the mix for both brothers throughout the recruitment process, even with Sanderson attempting to visit their home up until the day of their second commitment to the Hokies. However, Bassett had aspirations beyond joining college wrestling\u2019s most recent dynasty.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI have nothing but respect for what (Sanderson) is doing and this wasn\u2019t a decision I took lightly,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cIf I can add some trophies for Virginia Tech, that would be an amazing opportunity.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Recruits like Bassett and Miller, who have been in the national spotlight since they were children, chose the opportunity to be the faces of a program, rather than part of the machine in Happy Valley. Bassett has been an individual star since he began in the sport, even competing for Real American Freestyle as a high schooler.</p>\n                <p>Bassett\u2019s message for what it will take to rebuild a new dynasty is to not give any other programs too much respect and to hold belief in his coaches and teammates that they can outwork anybody.</p>\n                <p>For Miller, his mentality of what it means to be at the top of the sport guided his decision to follow Bassett to Virginia Tech.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been a guy that has to beat the best, and right now, Penn State is the best,\u201d Miller said. \u201cOur goal is to take a team to be top 10 up to the top one.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Virginia Tech has a plan to maximize the incoming talents, utilizing the redshirt on their 149 pound starter Caleb Henson after a season in which he went 30-2 en route to a national championship, to maximize their team points when Bassett arrives next year. Miller may follow in the spring similar to Forrest, but he admits the build will take time for the Hokies.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a couple of years of getting a full team and gaining consistency,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe just have to believe in ourselves and put in the hard work.\u201d</p>\n                <p>What has Penn State\u2019s response to these pushes by other programs? Essentially following the \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d motto. Sanderson\u2019s focus has been on building the program the way he has, focusing on recruiting wrestlers who prioritize becoming the best they can be over cashing in for the highest bidder.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a special thing going here and I think recruits see that,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cThis era has been good to us, so we\u2019re going to follow the rules and get the kids that want to come here for the right reasons.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Programs attempting to match Penn State are focusing on areas similar to what Sanderson pushed for the Nittany Lions in 2011, including acquiring a premium supporting staff and building wrestling clubs of top talent beside the college program.</p>\n                <p>They\u2019re also attempting to utilize the NIL era and outside desires of recruits to land the level of talent Sanderson has consistently developed.</p>\n                <p>But both recruits and analysts know that the gap is wide between Penn State and the rest of the wrestling landscape. Closing that gap will take a lot, especially with the Nittany Lions at the top of their game.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIf anyone is going to even match (Penn State), it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re losing anytime soon.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>After consecutive weekends of going 2-0, Penn State returns to the Bryce Jordan Center for the second time this season and the first time in the new calendar year.</p>\n                <p>The No. 1 Nittany Lions will face No. 6 Nebraska at 8 p.m. on Friday in a matchup between two of the premier teams in the country. Ahead of the dual, Cael Sanderson met with the media.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he had to say.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska</p>\n                <p>Despite the Cornhuskers being one of the better opponents that Penn State has seen this year, the mentality, as always, remains the same, as Sanderson said the mindset is \u201cthe same as every week.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it's pretty similar,\u201d Sanderson said of the mentality. \u201cFor me, the guys are trying to be the best they can be. So, I think it's exciting. I mean, it's a BJC dual, obviously, a very strong opponent. One where there\u2019s 10 good guys makes it fun.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson had praise for Nebraska head coach Mark Manning, who has been with the Cornhuskers for the last 26 seasons, clashing with Sanderson for the last 17 years.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson complimented Manning\u2019s passion, calling him a \u201cgreat competitor.\u201d He also highlighted his ability to churn out a consistently dominant program year in and year out.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEvery year they're really good, and they always have a really good dual-meet team,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Aaron Nagao</p>\n                <p>Last week, Sanderson confirmed that 141-pounder Aaron Nagao was out for the season following his injury at the Black Knight Invitational in November. He returned to the mat at the Southern Scuffle, winning his first match, but then medically forfeiting the next one.</p>\n                <p>His future is currently uncertain. Sanderson was unsure about the possibility of Nagao being able to obtain a medical redshirt, in which Sanderson replied with \u201cmaybe.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe would have one already, based on previous years, so I think that would be an option for him, if that\u2019s something we wanted to take,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said it\u2019ll be a \u201clong road to recovery\u201d for Nagao, who already had to make a similar form of a comeback, returning to the mat this season after having not wrestled for close to two years prior due to another injury.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to figure that out. Obviously, we would love to have him continue to wrestle,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe\u2019s also a guy who has exciting plans and he got married this past summer, and has a lot going on. So, a lot of good, positive things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>PJ Duke vs. Antrell Taylor</p>\n                <p>Up to this point of the year, Friday will bring the toughest matchup for No. 3 PJ Duke, as the freshman will face No. 5 Antrell Taylor, who won the NCAA Championship a season ago.</p>\n                <p>The top-five matchup will have lots of national attention when the pair squares off in the Bryce Jordan Center. It\u2019ll be the first time the tandem clashes on the collegiate stage, but not the first time ever.</p>\n                <p>Last May, when Duke was still a senior at Minisink Valley High School, he wrestled Taylor at the World Team Trials, beating him by a score of 8-6.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPJ is an incredible competitor, has an opportunity to wrestle a defending national champion in his weight,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for PJ to really kind of see where he is. Obviously, he\u2019s wrestled some great wrestlers this year, but now he gets a chance to wrestle a defending national champion.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness</p>\n                <p>On Saturday against Maryland, Shayne Van Ness got off to a start that not many anticipated, as he fell behind 7-1 to then-No. 7 Carter Young.</p>\n                <p>Then, the 149-pounder exploded, as the No. 1 wrestler in his class recorded nine takedowns en route to a 31-15 win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFor Shayne himself, if we give up a takedown or give up a few points, it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of competing and with a three-point takedown, you can get back in there really fast.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said it\u2019s a great lesson for Van Ness and the team, saying the match is an example of proving you can never truly be out of the contest.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEspecially with scoring the way it is now, you can make mistakes and you can come back, so it\u2019s not really that big of a deal,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING CONTENT</p>",

Overall, in the series, the blue and white lead 39-22, with last season\u2019s narrow 84-80 victory swinging things back in its favor.</p>\n                <p>Despite the emphatic all-time margin, it isn\u2019t smooth sailing in this millennium, as Northwestern only narrowly trails 10-11 at home in the series, suggesting that this one may lean their way. If anything, that favor is only a lean; the last eight meetings have been decided by an average of two possessions, and it looks like that narrow trend will continue.</p>\n                <p>Each squad retains only one starter from last year\u2019s game, both prominent scorers: Freddie Dilione V for Penn State and Nick Martinelli for Northwestern.</p>\n                <p>The player personnel has a shot to write new history in this matchup, yet there's an experience gap in the coaching department, to say the least. Mike Rhoades is in the midst of his third Big Ten season with Penn State, while Chris Collins is in his 13th with the Wildcats and is more than familiar with this clash.</p>\n                <p>Numbers for the nerds</p>\n                <p>Both these squads, as expected given their matching 9-11 records, the only two in the conference, stack up eerily similar.</p>\n                <p>Only a single tenth separates their scoring offenses, while only a few more separate their possession metrics. Shooting percentages, regardless of where on the floor, line up similarly, and that trend persists on the glass and assist figures, with Northwestern taking the edge in both.</p>\n                <p>Evan Miyakawa\u2019s advanced numbers also favor Northwestern, as they hold advantages in pace, consistency in performances, offensive and defensive efficiency and clear-cut roster rank. This results in the Nittany Lions' relative rating of 2.8 looking not as strong compared to the Wildcats\u2019, which is over 11.</p>\n                <p>Both have bottom-three resumes and quality of losses in the Big Ten this year, with the two alternating spots at the bottom of the rankings.</p>\n                <p>All this culminates in an edge for the Wildcats, as ESPN expects an 80% chance of them winning, though it isn\u2019t that cut-and-dry.</p>\n                <p>Behind Martinelli, the Northwestern scoring options are limited. Jayden Reid and Arrinten Page hold double-digit averages, but outside that trio, no one scores more than eight a game. For Rhoades, 60% of his ten-man rotation averages more than that figure, and as a unit, they\u2019re still one of the best teams in the Big Ten at generating steals \u2013 both shreds of optimism heading to the Midwest.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Matt Campbell has his first roster and staff in place at Penn State, so part of the efforts are now focused on building relationships with recruits in pursuit of the future.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what has happened on the recruiting trail recently.</p>\n                <p>Sights set on former commits</p>\n                <p>Prior to the firing of James Franklin, Penn State had the No. 1 ranked class in 2027 via the 247Sports Composite rankings.</p>\n                <p>Then, during the beginning of the season losing streak and removal of Franklin, all four commits backed off of their commitments.</p>\n                <p>Now that the dust has settled, and the Nittany Lions have a staff in place, part of their efforts have gone to re-establishing relationships with the former 2027 pledges.</p>\n                <p>The quartet of ex-commits are five-star running back Kemon Spell, four-star wide receiver Khalil Taylor, four-star safety Gabriel Jenkins and four-star offensive tackle Layton von Brandt.</p>\n                <p>Spell, from in-state McKeesport Area High School, is being pursued from almost all the top programs nationally.</p>\n                <p>He was originally scheduled to visit for Junior Day this past weekend, but didn\u2019t end up making it. Still, national recruiting experts have logged predictions for the tailback to restate his commitment to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Taylor and Jenkins, also Pennsylvania natives, made it to campus for Junior Day. The returns were positive, as both have scheduled an official visit for the summer. Jenkins included Penn State in his top-eight schools.</p>\n                <p>That leaves the lone non-Pennsylvania target, von Brant, who offensive line coach Ryan Clanton and Campbell visited at Appoquinimink High School in Delaware. Clanton also visited the offensive tackle a week later at home.</p>\n                <p>New, old targets emerge at Junior Day</p>\n                <p>Between targets carrying over from the last staff and ones emerging from the new staff, Penn State\u2019s Junior Day gave a first look on who could be in the future of the program.</p>\n                <p>Numerous old faces returned to campus for a weekend visit, including in-state targets in four-star 2027 wide receiver Matthew Gregory, four-star 2027 athlete Cade Cooper and four-star 2028 defensive end George Parkinson IV.</p>\n                <p>Gregory plays for Owen J Roberts High School, while Cooper and Parkinson both play for Malvern Prep, which is where defensive end Jackson Ford attended.</p>\n                <p>Four-star 2027 safety Larry Moon, from national powerhouse IMG Academy, was also in attendance. He was recruited by the previous staff, formerly playing for in-state Aliquippa High School and Central Catholic in Pittsburgh.</p>\n                <p>Other previous out-of-state targets were three-star 2027 offensive tackle Lucas Rhoa from California and 2028 defensive lineman RJ Cruz III from Maryland. Cruz plays for the McDonogh School, a recruiting hotbed for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>A Campbell target from Iowa State, four-star 2027 tight end Cooper Terwilliger from South Dakota, made the trip to State College, too. Add 2027 three-star Tommy Douglas from New Jersey powerhouse in Hun School of Princeton to the list.</p>\n                <p>Douglas, a tight end, is the son of New York Jets\u2019 general manager Joe Douglas.</p>\n                <p>And so was four-star 2027 offensive tackle Kyle Kuhn. He was previously recruited by both Penn State and Iowa State.</p>\n                <p>Recent in-state players who have emerged as targets that made it to Junior Day are Kohl\u2019s Kicking 5-star kicker Domenic Pratton from Central Valley High School and 2028 wide receiver Owen Johnson from La Salle College High School.</p>\n                <p>Westward expansion</p>\n                <p>Not only does Penn State have more reach in the Midwest with the Iowa State contingent, but the new staff has recruited the West Coast as defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn and defensive line coach Ikaika Malloe spent their past few seasons at USC and UCLA, respectively.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was active in Arizona, offering five-star 2028 defensive end Jalanie George, four-star 2027 quarterback Will Mencl, four-star 2028 wide receiver Roye Oliver III, three-star 2027 defensive lineman Yahzeen Zion, three-star 2028 athlete Keaton Fields and 2028 defensive end Landen Wade. They all play at either Desert Edge, Basha or Chandler, three top-10 programs in the state, per MaxPreps.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions also dished out offers to California recruits in four-star 2027 safety Isala Aisa Wily-Ava, three-star 2027 linebacker Josiah Poyer, three-star 2027 defensive lineman Montana Toilolo. Wily-Ava and Poyer play for St. John Bosco while Toilolo plays for Mater Dei, which is where cornerback Daryus Dixson played.</p>\n                <p>To round it out, there was also a quartet of offers in Washington to five-star 2028 tight end Tytan McNeal, three-star 2027 cornerback and Washington commit Maurice Willams, three-star 2027 defensive lineman Tevita Nonu and 2030 defensive lineman Tyson Daniels.</p>\n                <p>Junior Day approach</p>\n                <p>When Franklin was running the show, Junior Day had more bodies compared to what Campbell orchestrated for the first rendition of the event for him at Penn State.</p>\n                <p>There are a couple of reasons for this, with the weekend\u2019s snow storm potentially being one of them, but the overarching point of this was to create a more intimate environment.</p>\n                <p>It allows for all the new staff to interact with targets that remain from the previous staff, meeting them for either the first or second time if recruits had an in-home or at school visit.</p>\n                <p>The same kind of approach can be said for staffers who were retained from a season ago, it gives them the same opportunity to converse with players who were looked at as Iowa State targets.</p>\n                <p>Overall, a smaller turnout allows for more face-to-face attention, and gives a feeling of being pursued more as opposed to being one of many there for the festivities.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Chase Fisher | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State's Guy Gadowsky said on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZSPX5Mn0M\" target=\"_blank\">Tengwall Film Network via YouTube</a> on Monday that he received a call from former Nittany Lions football coach James Franklin last weekend. This call, however, wasn\u2019t to wish him luck against then-No. 5 Wisconsin, which Penn State swept over the weekend.</p>\n                <p>It was to ask if former Nittany Lions legend, and now Green Bay Packers superstar, Micah Parsons, could come support his alma mater at the Kohl Center, where then-No. 8 Penn State and the Badgers were playing. Gadowsky, who said Parsons was a \u201cbig [Gavin] McKenna fan,\u201d welcomed the former Penn State linebacker with open arms for their contest on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was so cool to meet him,\u201d Gadowsky said to the media on Tuesday evening. \u201cHe is such an amazing Penn Stater\u2026 He\u2019s one of the best athletes there is. But boy does he love Penn State, and the words that he said to our team were awesome. His message was awesome. And he just so clearly loves Penn State. Believes in Penn State\u2026 And I love the message that he had for the team; it was excellent.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Parsons visited Penn State in the locker room and talked to the team prior to and after the Nittany Lions\u2019 win over the Badgers on Saturday. Gadowsky said he gave Parsons a time frame of around 7:05 p.m. for when the team would be coming in from warm-ups. Parsons arrived at 5 p.m., before Gadowsky was even in the locker room.</p>\n                <p>In his time with the team postgame, as after any other Penn State win, the team THOR hammer, which is given to a player who, in Gadowsky\u2019s words on Tengwall\u2019s live show, \u201cfights the hardest (and) just does something spectacular for a win,\u201d was given out.</p>\n                <p>Parsons was given the opportunity to hold it and threw it down on a table in the center of the locker room, hyping the team up as the top of the hammer flew to the opposite side of the room. Luckily, Gadowsky said the hammer was fixed.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cIt was fun. It was perfect. It's not the first time (the hammer has) been broken. But that was the best time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>It was a special moment for the players, too. Penn State\u2019s coach said on Tengwall\u2019s show that stars Aiden Fink and Jackson Smith, being from Calgary, are huge Green Bay Packers fans. Fink, specifically, was \u201cjacked\u201d to meet Parsons.</p>\n                <p>Nittany Lions captain Dane Dowiak was also pumped to see him. He remembered watching Parsons play at Beaver Stadium on his visit years ago.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, he's just a Penn Stater at heart,\u201d Dowiak said. \u201cAnd I thought that was the coolest thing. And he said, through all his success throughout his career, there's no place like Penn State and wearing the blue and white. And before the game, when he told us that, I don't think anybody looked back. I think we all looked at each other and we said, \u2018We're going to get this done.\u2019 Just to have him by our side, especially when he plays in Wisconsin, having him by our side wearing that Penn State hockey jersey was really cool.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

Gadowsky told media that the forward is still \u201cday-to-day\u201d, but also adding \u201cwe expect him back soon.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Scouting of Michigan State</p>\n                <p>This is the second time the blue and white will see Michigan State, after getting swept in East Lansing back in November.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe think that we\u2019re a much better team now than we were back then,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cFrom a number of ways, and from a number of lessons, not just from that first series.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Spartans have been one of the top teams in the country in almost every aspect and boast one of collegiate hockey\u2019s top goaltenders in Trey Augustine.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBottom line is they\u2019re a really well-balanced team\u2026they do everything really, really well,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not a matter of finding the kinks in the armor, because I don\u2019t think that there are, it\u2019s a matter of us playing as good and consistent a game as you can.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>As January reaches its end, softball season looms around the corner. Penn State is set to kick off its 2026 campaign on Feb. 6 at the NFCA Leadoff Classic in Clearwater, Florida.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions finished 2025 with a 25-27 record and failed to reach a second straight NCAA Regional appearance. Last season, the blue and white were highlighted by its performance in the batter\u2019s box, but struggled from inside the pitcher's circle.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s staff completed last year with the highest ERA in the Big Ten at 5.76. With a highly anticipated comeback, a returning starter and new additions, the Nittany Lions have a chance to improve in the circle in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Bridget Nemeth</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-1 junior right-hander missed a majority of the 2025 season with an injury. Nemeth\u2019s only appearance came in the blue and white\u2019s second game of the season against Texas Tech, in which she faced just four batters.</p>\n                <p>However, two years ago, the Glendora, California, native had a rookie campaign for the ages. In 2024, Nemeth was the Big Ten Freshman of the Year and was a unanimous First-Team All-Big Ten selection. Additionally, she was the first player in program history to be named a Freshman All-American, earning recognition by both D1 Softball and Softball America.</p>\n                <p>Nemeth finished the season with a 23-8 record, setting a program best in single-season victories. The right-hander pitched 210 innings, starting 25 of 40 appearances. Nemeth\u2019s 1.77 ERA ranked second in the Big Ten, and her 202 strikeouts placed third.</p>\n                <p>After a year on the sidelines, Nemeth enters the upcoming season with much anticipation. If her dominant freshman campaign has any indication, it\u2019s that the junior has the talent and poise to once again anchor the Nittany Lions\u2019 pitching staff. Nemeth\u2019s return could be a turning point for the blue and white, and a reminder of just how special she can be in the circle.</p>\n                <p>Abigail Britton</p>\n                <p>Britton is the lone returner from Penn State\u2019s pitching staff last season. The sophomore right-hander split a majority of the time in the circle with the since graduated Mady Volpe. The two combined for 242.2 of the team's 316 total innings pitched.</p>\n                <p>In 2025, Britton made 42 appearances while tallying 21 starts. The LaVale, Maryland, native finished with a 6-10 record and 5.89 ERA. While Britton didn\u2019t put up the most staggering numbers in these regards, the right-hander was best when it came to closing games out.</p>\n                <p>Britton\u2019s five saves tied for the most in the Big Ten and already place the sophomore fifth in the Penn State record books for career saves.</p>\n                <p>Britton, now with a year of experience under her belt, will be a key part of helping the Nittany Lions improve their pitching numbers.</p>\n                <p>New faces</p>\n                <p>Along with the familiar arms in the circle, the blue and white also welcome its fair share of new ones.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps the biggest new addition to coach Clarisa Crowell\u2019s pitching staff is South Dakota transfer McKenna Young. The junior right-hander arrives off a breakout season with the Coyotes.</p>\n                <p>Young was a Second-Team All-Summit League selection after posting a 14-8 record with a 2.46 ERA. The Broadhead, Wisconsin, native finished the season with 152 strikeouts, and her 8.3 strikeouts per seven innings ranked No. 28 nationally. Additionally, Young's five complete-game shutouts placed her at No. 31 in the country.</p>\n                <p>Penn State also welcomes a fresh crop of rookies to its rotation, which includes two-way player Gabby Gradishar, alongside left-handers Brevyn Kellepouris and Mackenzie Duncan.</p>\n                <p>Gradishar was the No. 54 prospect and No. 18 pitcher/utility player out of Champion, Ohio. She was a two-time First-Team All-State selection, as well as being named a Second-Team All-American by MaxPreps in her senior season.</p>\n                <p>Kellepouris hails from Olathe, Kansas, and was a First-Team All-State selection in her final two seasons at Olathe West High School.</p>\n                <p>Duncan arrives in Happy Valley out of Winter Garden, Florida. The 5-foot-10 left-hander was ranked as the No. 58 overall player and No. 25 pitcher by Extra Inning Softball.</p>\n                <p>With lots of new depth that includes a mix of proven experience and high-upside newcomers, Penn State enters 2026 with cautious optimism and plenty to prove in the circle. If Nemeth can return to form, Britton continues to grow into her role and the new faces find comfort quickly, the Nittany Lions have the pieces to turn last year\u2019s biggest weakness into a strength.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Review | 7 Brew Coffee offers caffeine kick to State College",
    "author": "Lily Dorf | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>State College received a caffeine boost with Arkansas-based coffee and energy drink bar 7 Brew Coffee opening up at 1923 S Atherton St, this winter. The store is open from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, and offers coffee, energy drinks, teas and non-caffeinated options with customizations allowed for all.</p>\n                <p>This week, I ventured over to try out some of the new and exciting flavors of the various drink options.</p>\n                <p>Pixie Stick 7 Energy</p>\n                <p>I chose to order three drinks with the Pixie Stick 7 Energy being the first. The flavors within the drink help bring out the classic Pixie Stick flavor, combining orange, pomegranate and almond. I would say this drink has hints of a Pixie Stick flavor, with the orange coming out more than the other two.</p>\n                <p>My first sip tasted more like a cherry slushie, however after a few sips I started to taste the hints of orange and some slight pomegranate. The flavors within the drink are not incredibly overpowering, giving the drink a nice, balanced flavor.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately, the Pixie Stick 7 Energy was a bit too sweet for me. If you are a fan of sweeter energy drinks, this is definitely the one for you. This drink can be customized with the original energy base or with their sugar-free option.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 7/10</p>\n                <p>Peaches N\u2019 Cream 7 Fizz</p>\n                <p>This was the second drink I tried, opting for a non-caffeinated option to see how they compared to the caffeinated drinks offered.</p>\n                <p>The fizz drinks are made with a base of unflavored sparkling water, with syrups being added to give each drink its signature flavor.</p>\n                <p>Peaches N\u2019 Cream is made with peach and vanilla syrups, which can be substituted for sugar-free versions as well.</p>\n                <p>The sweetness level went down with this drink compared to the first, giving it a nice and refreshing flavor palette. It had the same essence as a peach ring candy, with the vanilla syrup being hard to pinpoint within the drink.</p>\n                <p>Because of this, the flavor and overall taste of the soda were not over the top, but still present, having more flavor than other sparkling water drinks. I could see this being a very refreshing drink to grab in the heat of the summer, or something to sip on while relaxing in the sun.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Snickerdoodle Mocha</p>\n                <p>This was the last and final drink I tried during my review, with it being the heaviest. The Snickerdoodle Mocha is a part of the store's 7 Classics, along with six other coffee-based drinks.</p>\n                <p>The drink contains a brown sugar cinnamon syrup mixed with vanilla mocha, and of course espresso. The Snickerdoodle Mocha also comes in a decaf option and has many customizations like milk type, sweetness level, toppings and sugar-free brown sugar cinnamon syrup.</p>\n                <p>The cinnamon within the drink was strong but not over the top, letting the mocha and coffee shine through. It was not extremely sweet like I had expected, which was a nice surprise. However, if you are not a big fan of mocha, I would opt for a different drink or customize the syrup.</p>\n                <p>The coffee also did not have a strong or bitter taste to it, helping to balance the drink out well. If strong coffee is what you usually go for, I would suggest asking for a lower sweetness level to your liking.</p>\n                <p>Overall, the flavors did not clash and made for a smooth and sweet drink.</p>\n                <p>Rating: 8/10</p>\n                <p>Final Thoughts</p>\n                <p>As someone who tries to steer clear of drinking too much caffeine throughout the day \u2014 whether that's energy drinks or coffee altogether \u2014 it was amazing to see so many options offered for those who are also looking to lower their caffeine intake.</p>\n                <p>With such a variety of drinks on the menu, this is an amazing spot to check out before class, on your way to a long study session or just to grab a few tasty drinks with friends.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After obtaining a 33-23 overall record and reaching the Big Ten semifinals, Penn State looks to reach the postseason for a third-straight year with a promising pitching staff.</p>\n                <p>However, losing an ace to the MLB Draft in Ryan DeSanto could pose a threat to third-year head coach Mike Gambino. The skipper turned to the transfer portal in an attempt to fill a void in the starting rotation.</p>\n                <p>Starters</p>\n                <p>Gambino found a possible hidden gem in Kyle Lazer through the portal. Lazer spent four years at West Chester and joined Penn State as a redshirt senior. While transitioning from a Division II to a Division I school can be unusual, Lazer arrives off his best season by far.</p>\n                <p>The right-handed pitcher made 13 starts and earned an 8-3 record. In those 13 appearances, Lazer recorded a 3.17 ERA with 75 strikeouts in 71 innings.</p>\n                <p>While competition will surely ramp up for the Havertown, Pennsylvania, native, he has the chance to find himself a starting role and continue to produce great outings.</p>\n                <p>Frankie Sanchez looks to make his return to the rotation after being out the entirety of the 2025 season with injury. Before being injured, the right-handed pitcher threw 27 strikeouts in 37.2 innings.</p>\n                <p>The redshirt senior will have a shot to end his final collegiate season with stellar outings and continue to add to the starting rotation.</p>\n                <p>Relievers</p>\n                <p>The bullpen received a couple of additions through the portal, as well. One being Ben Hudson from West Virginia.</p>\n                <p>The right-handed pitcher saw 27.1 innings in which he recorded 30 strikeouts. Hudson didn\u2019t allow a run in any game where he pitched more than an inning. The Medford, New Jersey, native did his part in getting the Mountaineers to the NCAA Super Regionals.</p>\n                <p>Of the returning arms, Matthew VanOstenbridge looks to continue to produce for the bullpen after making 23 appearances in his freshman year. The southpaw recorded a 4.32 ERA, striking out 38 in 41.2 innings.</p>\n                <p>VanOstenbridge will continue to be a hot arm out of the bullpen.</p>\n                <p>Similar to Sanchez, Ben DeMell enters his final collegiate season as a redshirt senior after a promising 2025 season. The right-handed pitcher brought his ERA down to 4.65 after doubling his previous strikeout total to 43.</p>\n                <p>The Concord, Ohio, native brings a towering figure at 6-foot-5 and 205 pounds, a size that could shake batters as they will be awaiting strong and fast pitches from the mound.</p>\n                <p>From dipping into the transfer portal to returning arms in the bullpen, Gambino sets his pitching room up in hopes of making it further than the semifinals in the Big Ten tournament.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lexi Cannan | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>January rolls around and suddenly nothing in your closet makes sense. Everyone has fresh outfits after break, and your closet didn\u2019t get the memo. You\u2019re standing there wondering how a full closet turned into absolutely nothing to wear.</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s the same hoodies, jeans and jackets \u2014 nothing\u2019s different, it just suddenly feels old. The good news is you don\u2019t need to go shopping to fix it.</p>\n                <p>A closet reset usually isn\u2019t about buying new clothes, it\u2019s about noticing the ones you already have. Most of the time, they\u2019ve just faded into the background.</p>\n                <p>Dress for your real day</p>\n                <p>It\u2019s easy to keep clothes for a version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Outfits for plans you never make, pieces that only work if you\u2019re suddenly a morning person or the clothes that looked good once but don\u2019t fit your day-to-day anymore can all be discarded.</p>\n                <p>Dress for your real schedule, not the one you swear you\u2019ll have \u201cnext week.\u201d Long walks to class, lecture halls, quick food and unpredictable weather don\u2019t need complicated outfits. They require clothes that feel comfortable, easy and reliable.</p>\n                <p>When your clothes actually fit your routine, getting dressed stops feeling like a daily struggle and just happens.</p>\n                <p>Rotate what\u2019s in front</p>\n                <p>If you see the same five things every morning, surprise, that\u2019s all you\u2019re wearing. A closet reset can be as simple as \u201coh wait, I forgot I owned this.\u201d Sometimes all it takes is moving one thing to the front for it to feel new again.</p>\n                <p>Most mornings are rushed. You\u2019re just trying to get to class on time, grab coffee and remember what\u2019s due, not plan an outfit.</p>\n                <p>When you\u2019re half awake, you grab whatever\u2019s easiest. That\u2019s why the same stuff\u2019s on repeat, not because the rest doesn\u2019t work.</p>\n                <p>Changing what\u2019s in front breaks that pattern. A few little changes can stop you from grabbing the same thing without thinking.</p>\n                <p>Stop saving outfits for \u201csomeday\u201d</p>\n                <p>A lot of clothes sit untouched because they\u2019re being saved for the \u201cright occasion.\u201d The problem is this imaginary event almost never happens, and if it does, you\u2019ll probably end up wearing something else anyway.</p>\n                <p>College life is mostly made up of regular days. Classes, studying, quick plans and walking across campus don\u2019t exactly scream \u201cspecial occasion.\u201d Those are the days you\u2019re actually living.</p>\n                <p>If you like something, wear it now. Don\u2019t save it for a night that may or may not come, or a plan that might get canceled at the last minute. Clothes don\u2019t need to be a big moment, they just need a reason to leave your closet.</p>\n                <p>Worst case, you wear it to class and nothing happens. Best case, you feel a little more put together on a very normal day. Honestly, that\u2019s a win.</p>\n                <p>Let comfort do the work</p>\n                <p>A good outfit doesn\u2019t need to be impressive. It just needs to feel good enough that you\u2019re not thinking about it all day or constantly adjusting it between classes.</p>\n                <p>Jeans that fit well, hoodies that don\u2019t itch and shoes you can actually walk across campus in matter way more than trends. When you\u2019re comfortable, you\u2019re not distracted by what you\u2019re wearing, and that confidence shows \u2014 even on days when just getting dressed feels like enough.</p>\n                <p>If you\u2019re fixing your clothes all day, they\u2019re not doing their job. Comfort matters when your days are long and you\u2019re always on the move. The best outfits are the ones you forget you\u2019re even wearing.</p>\n                <p>Outfit repeating is allowed</p>\n                <p>Wearing a jacket twice in one week? That\u2019s normal behavior. It\u2019s kind of impressive you didn\u2019t lose it between classes or leave it on a chair somewhere.</p>\n                <p>If it makes mornings easier, it earns a repeat. Most people aren\u2019t paying attention to what you\u2019re wearing , they\u2019re focused on getting through their own chaos, making it to class on time and remembering when their next exam is.</p>\n                <p>Outfit repetition is the least of anyone\u2019s concerns. If it makes your day easier, that\u2019s all it really needs to do.</p>\n                <p>MORE LIFESTYLE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Jadzia Santiago | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>So, you\u2019ve read TikTok\u2019s new terms of service. Or, rather, you opened the app and hit \u201cAgree\u201d, only to look at the news three hours later and read that (allegedly) you just sold everything but your soul for your 8 a.m. dose of hopelessness and hot influencers.</p>\n                <p>That didn\u2019t faze you at first. As someone who\u2019s terminally online, you\u2019re no stranger to making problems for yourself.</p>\n                <p>But now that sale (also allegedly) has sociopolitical implications?</p>\n                <p>I mean, they\u2019re tracking information \u201cyou disclose\u201d about your \u201cracial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information,\u201d ehhh macarena.</p>\n                <p>Sounds like a lot, and feels a little relevant. Well, doomscrollers rejoice, because this really isn\u2019t that big a deal!</p>\n                <p>First off, as your local tinfoil hat would argue, it\u2019s nothing that Big Tech wasn\u2019t doing anyway. Anyone familiar with the demonic wiles of 5G (and the terms and conditions of other social media apps) knows just how much information They take from you anyway.</p>\n                <p>Now they\u2019re just being open about it, which isn\u2019t worrying at all. Privacy, in the digital age? Pssssh.</p>\n                <p>And besides, best case scenario is that they\u2019re using that data for, you guessed it, ads!</p>\n                <p>All they wanna do is sell you solutions to your deepest insecurities and darkest fears.</p>\n                <p>Acne? There\u2019s an unregulated supplement with no ingredient list for that. Stomach fat? Brutal shapewear that crushes your lungs. All followed by 20 videos about how unlovable those traits are, so you gotta get rid of them stat.</p>\n                <p>Speaking of love, are you worried about coming out to your parents (because you may not know how many times you watched that thirst trap, but your data does)? Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll send more and more ads for pride merch to the family TV!</p>\n                <p>Never worry about being homesick again, because having someone to strategically gather your secrets and use them against you will make you feel like you\u2019re always with your family.</p>\n                <p>Who needs to use that information for something like diagnosing health conditions when you can sell it?</p>\n                <p>All harmless \u2014 of course, unless you\u2019re starting to develop the Wrong Opinions. And they can tell when you are, you know.</p>\n                <p>But like, with an all-seeing presence devoted to moral goodness like this, how could you ever go wrong in life? When not even your step count or your resting heart rate are yours anymore, it feels a little like having a guardian angel.</p>\n                <p>Considering how lonely we all are right now, I think we need a companion. And the algorithm might just be the snuggliest machine gun the world has ever seen.</p>\n                <p>Come on, not even your boyfriend listens to you this much.</p>\n                <p>Even if the government really is collecting your data to use it for who knows what, that doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t you know that your seasonal allergies, tarot cards, celebrity crushes and pronouns are all matters of national security?</p>\n                <p>Forget anything else, you, the little nerd scrolling through fan edits of Joe Keery and Maya Hawke in \u201cStranger Things\u201d should be our biggest priority as a nation.</p>\n                <p>Maybe it\u2019ll make you a little nervous if you\u2019re politically outspoken, but we live in a democracy with freedom of speech, so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue \u2026 right?</p>\n                <p>Anyway! All in all, these open, honest changes to TikTok really make me hopeful for the future.

    "description": "<p>Surrounded by her teammates, sophomore Nicole Hall received the call of a lifetime with an invitation to the 2026 Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOne of the teammates filmed her getting the call from the Swedish officials, and it was just pure joy on her face and her reaction,\u201d coach Jeff Kampersal told The Daily Collegian. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty genuine response, and I\u2019m proud of her for putting in the time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While only a sophomore at Penn State, Hall experienced international play well before she takes on the Olympics in February.</p>\n                <p>The Stockholm, Sweden, native competed on a pair of teams in the Swedish Women\u2019s Hockey League before representing her country on the 18U Swedish team at the 2021 and 2022 World Championships.</p>\n                <p>When Hall arrived at Penn State in 2024, she already had six years of international and semi-professional experience.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a great teammate,\u201d sophomore Abby Stonehouse said. \u201cShe\u2019s super fun to be around, helps her teammates out, and then on the ice, is obviously a great player, high hockey IQ and makes her line mates better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Right off the bat, Hall took the ice for the Nittany Lions and her presence had a positive influence on her team.</p>\n                <p>While playing in all 38 games in her freshman year, Hall recorded seven goals and four assists. Just two weeks into the season, the forward recorded her first and second career goals in back-to-back games against Union and Dartmouth.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAll the practices, the games, (work) off the ice, on the ice has helped me,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThe coaches are willing to help all day, and my teammates are making me a better hockey player every day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As a freshman, Hall stood up and helped her teammates down the stretch of a successful season as the Nittany Lions earned a spot in the AHA semifinals against RIT.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI watched her in the world championships when she was the captain of the U18 Sweden team,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe made it with those little things like winning plays, having good habits and being a good teammate. We knew she had leadership capabilities.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Hall\u2019s success was on display throughout the postseason as she recorded two blocks and a faceoff victory as she wrapped up her first year as an AHA champion.</p>\n                <p>Entering her second season, Hall\u2019s efforts were even more on display as she increased her work ethic and put in the work ahead of Year 2.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(The biggest thing I learned from her) is how hard she works,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cShe never takes a shift off. She\u2019s always in there, so she just taught me to always keep my feet moving and work hard.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Just as the Nittany Lions opened 2025 with success \u2014 earning 16 straight wins \u2014 Hall found her own success with goals in each of the first two games of the year.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNicole and her teammates kind of run the show in terms of how they want their season to go,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe just brings that lunch pail, work hard mentality to Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After 16 straight wins, Penn State suffered its first loss of the season against Northeastern on Nov. 28. With the help of Hall\u2019s mentality, the blue and white came back and went on an 8-3 stretch since then.</p>\n                <p>\u201cSometimes you can get frustrated a bit, but she just keeps up the positive energy,\u201d graduate student Mya Vaslet said. \u201cShe just keeps saying, \u2018Just trust the process, it\u2019ll come,\u2019 and I think that\u2019s really important too.\u201d</p>\n                <p>On Jan. 12, Hall received a phone call from the Swedish national team, giving her the news that she would be competing in her first Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe were all really excited,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cI know she was waiting to get the call, but there wasn\u2019t a doubt in any of our minds she wasn\u2019t going to get it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Hall has played for the senior women\u2019s team in 15 contests, February will mark her first time suiting up for the Olympic Games, a memory she\u2019ll never forget.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI started crying right away when they told me I have a ticket for the Olympics,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI was speechless, I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In addition to Hall taking the big stage, her teammates Matilde Fantin, Tessa Janecke and former Nittany Lion Jessica Adolfsson will all compete in the Olympics as well.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNo matter (what position) you play at Penn State hockey, we get better day in and day out,\u201d Vaslet said. \u201cIt shows with people going to the Olympics.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After competing in their first preliminary contest on Feb. 5 against Germany, Hall and Team Sweden will face off against Fantin and Team Italy on Feb. 7.</p>\n                <p>\u201cLet the best woman win,\u201d Hall said.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s 2026 season is rapidly approaching, with its season opener in the near future. The Nittany Lions are poised for a bounce-back year after finishing 25-27 and missing the NCAA tournament in 2025.</p>\n                <p>While the blue and white have a plethora of returners on the infield, its outfield will be filled with mostly fresh faces in the new campaign. After the pair of veteran outfielders, Jenna Nelson and Haylie Brunson, graduated, Clarisa Crowell\u2019s squad is left with two open positions in the outfield.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Natalie Lieto spearheads the outfield as the lone returner this season for the Nittany Lions, while junior Frankee Flesher and freshman Breanna Hanik are set for their first seasons.</p>\n                <p>Natalie Lieto</p>\n                <p>The Monroe, Connecticut, native had a breakout freshman campaign on both sides of the field last season. Lieto brings experience as she started all 50 games she played in, slashing an impressive .329 batting average, with seven home runs and 30 RBIs in 149 at bats. Her 49 hits were fifth-most on the team in Penn State\u2019s historic 2025 offensive campaign.</p>\n                <p>The 5-foot-7 outfielder also flashed the glove, surrendering just one error and finishing with an outstanding 0.990 fielding percentage. Lieto\u2019s lockdown defense didn\u2019t go unnoticed, as she was one of just two true freshmen to be named to the Big Ten All-Defensive Team.</p>\n                <p>Lieto also reached base often with an efficient .936 OPS and was sneaky on the basepaths, stealing 10 bases in 12 attempts.</p>\n                <p>Penn State must continue to get this production and more from its star outfielder in Lieto\u2019s sophomore campaign. She\u2019s essential for anchoring the defense in the outfield alongside two rookie players.</p>\n                <p>Frankee Flesher</p>\n                <p>The Chesterland, Ohio, native enters her first collegiate softball season after she joined the program following the conclusion of the 2025 season. The junior was previously a member of the women\u2019s soccer team before medically retiring from the sport.</p>\n                <p>Flesher brings two years of varsity softball experience at West Gauga High School and a few years of travel experience with the Ohio Outlaws 05 National program from 2019 to 2021 into Happy Valley. As a standout soccer player in high school, she is versatile and extremely athletic, allowing her to be spread out across the outfield.</p>\n                <p>The 5-foot-5 outfielder\u2019s last softball season was outstanding. As a sophomore at West Gauga High School, the lefty batter produced a .629 average with 39 hits and 22 RBIs.</p>\n                <p>Breanna Hanik</p>\n                <p>The Oak Lawn, Illinois, native was a standout recruit in the 2025 class, ranked as the nation\u2019s No. 65 overall player and No. 22 among outfielders. Hanik led Marist High School to the state championship game in three seasons throughout her four years and was named an All-Conference choice in 2023 and 2024.</p>\n                <p>Her breakout junior campaign earned her All-State, All-Area and Golden Glove awards, and she also set a single-season doubles record with 19. Hanik is the whole package of speed, power, and defense, recording 11 home runs and 16 stolen bases in one season.</p>\n                <p>With young players throughout the outfield and playing together for the first time, Crowell may switch around their positions during the season. The fresh talent brings much to look forward to on both sides of the field for the blue and white\u2019s faithful fans.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

So, if you look at Tessa or Abbey Murphy from Minnesota, those kids can stay by you. They can run you over, and they're driven towards their goals, whether it's making the Olympics or it's trying to win a national championship.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Among the many Olympic rosters are a mix of professional talent from the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League (PWHL), top-tier collegiate players and veterans of international competition, making the Olympics the truest form of \u201cbest-on-best\u201d hockey.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPeople only see a fraction of the work that (Janecke) puts in, that our team puts in, so for her to go out there knowing that this was her dream, there's no way you can put it into words,\u201d Katelyn Roberts said. \u201cAs a friend, I'm proud. As her teammate, I'm proud. As a watcher of hers, I'm proud. There's no other way to say it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Janecke isn\u2019t merely a face amongst the many other superstars; she\u2019s carved a legacy of her own.</p>\n                <p>With the U.S. National Team, Janecke is a two-time IIHF Women\u2019s World Champion and one-time runner-up, winning her first in 2023 and most recently in 2025, with a silver medal in 2024 between the victories.</p>\n                <p>She also earned a silver medal in the 2022 IIHF U18 Women\u2019s World Junior Championship.</p>\n                <p>Last April in Czechia, Janecke tapped in the \u201cgolden goal\u201d on a backdoor feed from the Minnesota Frost\u2019s Taylor Heise with 2:53 remaining in overtime to win the 2025 IIHF Women\u2019s World Championship, 4-3, over Canada. Before her teammates swarmed her in celebration, Janecke leapt into the air and hoisted her stick into the stands.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThose are not only huge moments for (Janecke), which we're proud of her for, but also, they put our program on the map,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cShe is such a talented player, and we were so lucky to have her come here. It\u2019s a testament to the amount of skill that our team has and also how much the program has changed under coach Jeff, especially over the past couple of years, with him being able to bring in that top-caliber talent.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In 2023, Janecke scored three goals and added three helpers throughout the tournament to aid the United States in winning the gold medal against the hosting nation, Canada.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(The Olympics are) going to be on a much bigger scale,\u201d Janecke said. \u201cThere are a lot more eyes on you, but I think for our team, nothing is going to change. We\u2019ve got to go in there with the right mindset, but there can't be a moment that's going to be too big or one that we're not prepared for.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Janecke is currently riding the high of a 40-point season with the Nittany Lions, including an eight-game point streak. She leads Penn State with 19 goals and 21 assists heading into her break in action from the NCAA.</p>\n                <p>On the national scale this season, Janecke ranks ninth in points and eighth in goals. That includes her missing a few games due to her playing in the 2025 Rivalry Series, a four-game showcase against Team Canada that the United States swept. There, Janecke tallied a goal and two assists.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's definitely posed more as an opportunity than a loss because it's an amazing opportunity for (Janecke), and there's no way she should pass this up,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cFor us, we kind of see it as an opportunity for our forwards to grow and to gain depth for our team, so that when she does come back, we're in a groove scoring and she'll be in her groove scoring, and all the pieces will fit together at the right time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite having to miss collegiate action for a month in Europe, Janecke\u2019s senior season isn\u2019t over yet. With the AHA and NCAA tournaments waiting for her when she returns to Happy Valley, the captain has one more chance to secure the coveted National Championship with her alma mater.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMaybe we're not as formidable without Tessa, Nicole and Matilde, but we're still pretty deep, and we're still going to show up and play hard,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cAnd I think our players want to prove that they can do it without those three players as well. When they come back, they'll be even stronger.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Having already left campus for training camps, Janecke will be missing the rest of the regular season as well as the first round of the upcoming AHA playoffs.

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse will have a change at the goaltending position. Longtime goalie Jack Fracyon has moved on to the PLL, meaning there will be a goalkeeper in the crease. The same can\u2019t be said for the Nittany Lions in the faceoff circle.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have a few returners and should be more stable than last season.</p>\n                <p>Faceoff Guys</p>\n                <p>A big surprise last season was Colby Baldwin. Baldwin was crucial on the faceoff dot. Baldwin led the team in attempts with 269 and won 156 of those draws for a .580 faceoff win percentage. That was a large increase from his freshman season, where he only had a .379 faceoff winning percentage that first year.</p>\n                <p>The junior also contributed three goals and four assists. The White Plains, New York, native will be crucial in getting the Nittany Lions' possession to start the offense in each game.</p>\n                <p>Competing with Baldwin is Reid Gills. The sophomore took draws after Baldwin got injured. Gills went 79-for-130, which is a .608 faceoff win percentage. There could be some competition between the two, but it\u2019s likely Baldwin will get the start. Gills will be the main backup and will play if Baldwin struggles.</p>\n                <p>Zach Arbuckle rounds out the faceoff guys on the roster. Arbuckle was a three-star recruit according to Inside Lacrosse. He could see the field if an injury were to occur, but it\u2019s expected that he redshirts.</p>\n                <p>Goalies</p>\n                <p>With the loss of Fracyon, Ben Johnson is in line to be the starter. Johnson is also the only goaltender on the roster who has played in a game. The Peoria, Illinois, native has played in five total games, including two from last season, tallying three saves and a .600 save percentage last season.</p>\n                <p>Johnson has a goals against average of 8.00, but only faced a total of eight shots last year. This will be the first time he has a strong chance to have the crease to himself.</p>\n                <p>Preston Hawkins is a potential backup. Hawkins was the 96th best player in the 2025 recruiting class and could be given a chance to flash his skill if the squad is dominating a game.</p>\n                <p>With the lack of playing experience behind Johnson, it seems that Hawkins is the frontrunner to be the backup.</p>\n                <p>The other depth in the cage are Will Mitchell and Hayes Schreiner. Mitchell redshirted last season, and Schreiner hasn\u2019t seen the field in three years with the squad.</p>\n                <p>It seems that both are desperate depth options, but neither is expected to see the field next season.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Deal | Sports Editor",
    "description": "<p>Marcus Blaze entered Happy Valley as the No. 1 wrestler in the 2025 recruiting class. Before even wrestling in a blue and white singlet, Blaze took the international world by storm.</p>\n                <p>He\u2019s a U17 and U20 World Champion, placed third at the 2024 Olympic Trials as an 18-year old and owns four state championships in Ohio. He left Perrysburg High School with a 196-2 record.</p>\n                <p>All of those accolades made it seem like Blaze would be a contender for the national title, no matter the weight class he was in. Blaze is currently No. 4 in the national rankings, but the competition at 133 pounds continues to get deeper and deeper following the potential burning of multiple redshirts.</p>\n                <p>To begin, the national finalists last year \u2014 Lucas Byrd of Illinois and Iowa\u2019s Drake Ayala \u2014 are back for another year. To emphasize the depth of this weight class, Ayala, who\u2019s been on the verge of a national title for the past couple years, is No. 9 in the country, according to InterMat.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State redshirt freshman Ben Davino has been unleashed for the Buckeyes and is a big reason for them being No. 2 in the NWCA rankings. Davino holds a 15-0 record and could pose as the biggest threat to Blaze\u2019s undefeated dual season when Ohio State travels to the Bryce Jordan Center in February.</p>\n                <p>The other Big Ten competitor is Zan Fugitt out of Wisconsin. Fugitt ranks at No. 12 and adds to the young crop of talent. Fugitt is a redshirt sophomore and placed fourth at the NCAA Tournament last season in his first full season of competition.</p>\n                <p>Out of the Big 12, No. 3 Evan Frost from Iowa State appears to be the favorite for the conference title with Arizona State\u2019s Kyler Larkin not far behind him at No. 6 with a 14-1 record. Frost didn\u2019t wrestle against the Sun Devils when the Cyclones defeated them 29-14 on Jan. 6.</p>\n                <p>Behind them is Dominick Sorrano, who holds a 9-0 record out of Northern Colorado.</p>\n                <p>Despite the three Big 12 wrestlers, and Big Ten wrestlers who could all earn the national title spot, there\u2019s two new freshmen that are expected to burn their redshirts and will instantly become contenders.</p>\n                <p>Oklahoma State no longer has a problem at 133 pounds after Jax Forrest enrolled early with the Cowboys. Forrest was a 2025 U23 World Champion, as well as a 2025 US Open champion.</p>\n                <p>Forrest instantly becomes a favorite for the national title, and a Blaze-Forrest title match would likely break the internet. It\u2019d be the first time Cael Sanderson and David Taylor sat across from each other at the biggest stage, and for it to be two of the best young stars in the sport facing off, the hype for the matchup would be palpable.</p>\n                <p>The other freshman who\u2019s expected to burn his redshirt is Virginia Tech\u2019s Aaron Seidel. In his most recent match, Seidel took down then-No. 7 Tyler Knox of Stanford, 13-0. In one of his first matches of his young career, Seidel took down Dylan Shawver, the 2024 Big Ten Champion, by tech fall, solidifying his arrival onto the scene.</p>\n                <p>With Forrest and Seidel\u2019s emergence, in addition to the other major competitors, the 133-pound weight class could cause chaos come NCAA Tournament time, making Blaze\u2019s path to the final a tough task.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Matilde Fantin has spent the last few months traveling from Penn State to Italy\u2019s Olympic camp in Canada, gearing up daily for early-morning skates and playing in multiple games in hopes of achieving a childhood dream.</p>\n                <p>Following months of preparation, the freshman can now call herself an Olympian.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI still need to realize it\u2019s actually real,\u201d Fantin told The Daily Collegian. \u201cI\u2019m really happy, and I\u2019m excited to show how good (Team Italy) is. I\u2019m excited to represent my country again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Como, Italy, native\u2019s path to reaching the Olympics has been nothing short of impressive. Before making her start at Penn State, Fantin had the honor to represent her country at the 2025 IIHF Division 1B Women\u2019s World Championship. She used this monumental stage to showcase her talent, leading the tournament with 10 points.</p>\n                <p>The skills shown by Fantin stood out to coach Jeff Kampersal in his recruiting process, leading to one of the most impactful additions to the lineup.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMatilde is a hard worker. She looks like a pro and has a pro skill set in the way that she plays with her head up,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe does a lot of good things, like creating time and space. She's really smart. She takes instructions, so she shows a willingness to get better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Fantin adjusted quickly to collegiate hockey, as she has already won multiple AHA conference awards. Most notably, being the Freshman of the Month in September and October.</p>\n                <p>More than halfway through her freshman season, the forward showed her willingness to learn through her on-ice training with upperclassmen. As a result, Fantin believes that playing for Penn State has been a great place for her to \u201cplay and grow.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think just having the chance to go on the ice with really good players and training with them,\u201d Fantin said. \u201cAlso, having the chance to experience playing with Tessa (Janecke) and some of the seniors is just great. It's a great environment to grow.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Off the ice, Fantin has found a connection with fellow international freshman, Danica Maynard. The Lake Country, British Columbia, native has been beside Fantin every step of the way on and off the ice.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Fantin and I) understand each other, and we understand that we may be missing home sometimes and we can\u2019t contact (our families),\u201d Maynard said. \u201cJust being able to look out for each other, that\u2019s a really good spot for us. We never feel alone.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Fantin said she\u2019s leaned heavily on herself for support over the past few months.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust feeling good about myself and having my confidence up. It's always hard, especially when you see other people that are fighting for a spot, and you're in the same situation,\u201d Fantin said. \u201cJust keep the focus up and having my confidence up, I just keep going every day. Working hard.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Though hockey isn\u2019t a popular sport in Italy, Fantin said that didn't deter her.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHockey is not really important for our nation, so it\u2019s always hard to get a chance to play in college and showcase yourself,\u201d Fantin said. \u201cI would just say to my younger self to keep working hard and going with your passion, hockey is the thing I love to do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As the games quickly approach, starting on Feb. 5, the freshman is excited about the state of the women\u2019s hockey program at Penn State. The program is home to four total Olympians.</p>\n                <p>Fantin will join two current Penn State teammates, Janecke and Nicole Hall, as the three Nittany Lions represent their respective countries in the games. Jessica Adolfsson, a defenseman for Penn State from 2018 to 2021, fills out the Nittany Lions represented abroad.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy for (Janecke and Hall) making the team. It just shows how good of a program we are right now,\u201d Fantin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that players from our school can represent, as well.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY CONTENT</p>",

Preparations for snow removal operations were laid out by OPP to clear 23 miles of sidewalks and 31 miles of streets on the University Park campus.</p>\n                <p>A couple months later, on March 15, Students returning to State College after spring break ran into winter weather that included five inches of snow which created significant travel impacts with up to a foot of snow in surrounding states.</p>\n                <p>2002</p>\n                <p>The University Weather Service predicted around three inches of snow would greet students upon return for the spring semester on Jan. 7.

The weather resulted in a delay of the start of the semester.</p>\n                <p>Essential university personnel were called in as the university was closed due to winter weather in early February.

    "title": "Penn State notebook | Mike Rhoades talks support from administration, insight from Ohio State loss",
    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After a ninth straight conference loss for Penn State, Mike Rhoades was back in the Bryce Jordan Center media room for his weekly presser Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades spoke on the support he gets from Penn State\u2019s administration in addition to some insight into the defeat to Ohio State on Monday night.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s more of what Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Support from administration</p>\n                <p>Rhoades is in Year 3 of his attempt to build a basketball program at Penn State. There hasn\u2019t been much historical success by the Nittany Lions, with Rhoades often referring that the team has only seen \u201cpockets of success.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades was asked if Penn State\u2019s administration is giving enough support to help him get the program to where he wants it to be.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat's the envelope I got to push all the time, and we're going to fight for that,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThat's what's great about working for (Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics) Pat Kraft is I can have those open conversations with him about where we need to go and where we need to push \u2026 I could walk into Pat's office at any time and sit down and have a kind of candid conversation with him because we all want the same thing. We want to build this program to make it a winner.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are off to a 9-11 start this season, including an 0-9 start to Big Ten play. Last year saw Rhoades\u2019 squad finish 16-15 with six Big Ten wins, which was after a 16-17 record with nine conference regular-season wins during Rhoades\u2019 first campaign with the team in 2023-24.</p>\n                <p>This season, Penn State has the youngest roster in the Big Ten and one of the youngest in the country, according to Rhoades. The Nittany Lions have gone up against more experienced teams across the Big Ten so far through the conference slate.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe culture of college basketball now is to get to get older quicker, and to get bigger and stronger and older quicker, and our league is doing that in a specific way,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThat's something we got to address as we move forward. But that's what's great about Pat is it's not a \u2018No.\u2019 It's \u2018Alright, let's see what we can do,\u2019 and we have some great conversations about it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>What went wrong vs. Ohio State</p>\n                <p>Midway through the first half of Monday\u2019s game, Ohio State went on a 14-2 run to give it a 25-11 advantage over Penn State. The Nittany Lions cut the lead down to 33-23 with 3:55 left in the half, but the Buckeyes managed to gain a 50-32 halftime advantage.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State shot 66.7% from the field and 54.5% from 3-point range during the first half.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're just not a very good defensive team,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIn league play, other teams are shooting 52% (from the field) and 41% from three. That's not winning basketball. That's hard. I do think some of this is youth, some of it is guarding star players who are really good players. We're getting beat, we're getting beat way too much, and then they get going. And we've really struggled letting good players get going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State prevented Ohio State guard Bruce Thornton from generating much as he ended with nine points on 4-of-6 shooting. However, as Rhoades noted, fellow guard John Mobley Jr. went off instead for 25 points with 5-of-11 shooting from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>It was the third consecutive game where the Nittany Lions held a large halftime deficit. Penn State slimmed Ohio State\u2019s lead down to 60-59 in the second half, but it never fully overcame the 18-point hole at halftime as the Buckeyes won, 84-78.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think our defense, our guarding, and the half-court defense, we struggled, just not consistent. I think that's number one. The second thing, and very close to the number one, is when another team goes on a run, instead of having poise, and it starts with me helping these guys understand it, it\u2019s, \u2018I got hit a three. I got to make a play to get us back in it.\u2019 And that makes it a snowball, and it's become a big snowball in some of these games.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Players\u2019 minutes in Ohio State game</p>\n                <p>There were a few lineup choices that stood out during the Ohio State game, such as guard Melih Tunca getting 17 minutes and forward Mason Blackwood only getting four minutes.</p>\n                <p>Tunca played just 16 minutes during the Maryland and Wisconsin games combined, and he has to be more aggressive to see more action, according to Rhoades. Against the Buckeyes, Rhoades said Tunca showcased that, and the Turkey native notched 13 points on 4-of-8 shooting from the field.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI thought what was promising for Melih yesterday was how hard he tried to play defense and he battled,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThen if you get lost in the game of effort and approach and just being aggressive and flying around, usually your instincts take over. And you saw his instincts on the offensive end take over. We need that. We need that from him.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Elsewhere, Blackwood saw limited action despite coming off a career night against Wisconsin, which saw him tally 14 points and six rebounds.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades cited gameflow for the reasoning behind Blackwood\u2019s lesser minutes, with wing Eli Rice totaling a career-high 20 points on 6-of-11 3-point shooting in 34 minutes and forward Josh Reed getting 13 points and five rebounds in 38 minutes.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMason's had some great games for us, and the way the game was going yesterday, I thought Josh was playing really well, and Eli was shooting the ball well,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSome of it is, I didn't want to have three or four freshmen on the court at the same time. I mean, Mason has improved tremendously, and he's getting better and better. Some games he's going to play more than others.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Also in the frontcourt, big men Sa\u0161a Ciani and Justin Houser saw one minute each versus the Buckeyes. Rhoades said Houser has done a \u201creally good job\u201d of \u201cpicking things up,\u201d but the speed of the game is what\u2019s catching up to him.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're going to go with the guys that can help us in that moment,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSome matchups are better than others, and (we) try to put them out there for them to have a chance with the right guys to have success.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Amidst its third-worst losing stretch in school history, Penn State is on the outside looking in with the Big Ten tournament just over a month away.</p>\n                <p>Coach Carolyn Kieger expressed the team\u2019s desire to play harder against more favorable opponents over the final stretch, starting with the Lady Lions\u2019 matchup against Minnesota on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>Remaining opponents</p>\n                <p>For the second straight year, Penn State is outside the Big Ten tournament and needs big wins if it wants to continue its season into March.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe got some good games coming up against teams near who we need to be in order to get into the postseason,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cObviously, focusing on one game at a time, but we know our schedule is more favorable down the stretch.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Included in those remaining games are Indiana, Rutgers and Northwestern, who all sit at two or fewer conference wins. Before the Lady Lions face those struggling teams, they\u2019ll face the Golden Gophers, who are 14-6 with five Big Ten victories.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMinnesota is very versatile,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cThey\u2019re the best defensive team in the Big Ten. They do a great job of holding their opponents for points per game.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Golden Gophers\u2019 low points against opponents stem from the slower pace of play they run. As a result, Minnesota gives up a conference-low 10.6 turnovers per game, as opposed to Penn State\u2019s conference-high 18.9 turnovers per game.</p>\n                <p>Lineup changes</p>\n                <p>Saturday\u2019s game against Oregon featured a very different starting lineup for the Lady Lions, missing both Kiyomi McMiller and Gracie Merkle.</p>\n                <p>While Merkle went down with what is believed to be a head injury during last week\u2019s game against Washington, McMiller came off the bench for the first time this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the same thing we\u2019ve been doing all year,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cChanging up lineups, changing up starters and trying to find the right fit at the right time.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In addition to Merkle\u2019s appearance on the availability report, senior Amiya Evans has been out since Jan. 11, but has a chance to return on Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHopefully (Gracie and Amiya) are healthy to play, but obviously concerned about their health first,\u201d Kieger said.</p>\n                <p>Career reflection</p>\n                <p>With Kieger\u2019s seventh season with Penn State winding down, she\u2019s on track for her sixth losing season, with four of the worst losing streaks in school history.</p>\n                <p>This year, the Lady Lions are riding a 0-10 conference record alongside the men\u2019s team\u2019s 0-9 record. Both Kieger and Mike Rhoades have faced immense backlash on the internet over the past few weeks over the legacy they\u2019re leaving behind.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI mean, we approach every game the same,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe approach everything the same, which is giving our all and putting our team in a position to win. We\u2019re going to continue to do that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With eight games left this year, Kieger has a chance to break even or go above .500. Despite the hard path to reach that goal, her squad is continuing to fight for its season with Kieger in the hot seat.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe continue to instill winning habits and make sure that we\u2019re talking about what it takes to succeed in all walks of life,\u201d Kieger said. \u201cWe want Penn State to win, but we want our women to feel it, and we want them to feel proud of themselves and each other.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Similar to Penn State, there were two dominant victories over the weekend as the rest of the Big Ten saw a series of lopsided-dual matches.</p>\n                <p>However, two duals stood above the rest in competitiveness, headlined by a clash between upcoming opponents for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>BJC Dual preview</p>\n                <p>The most noteworthy contests of the previous weekend came from Penn State\u2019s upcoming dual opponents in the Bryce Jordan Center in Nebraska and Ohio State. The two faced marquee opponents on Friday before clashing with each other in a highlight-reel matchup on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n                <p>The Buckeyes started the action on Friday with a 29-9 blowout of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Ohio State won the first five matches en route to taking seven out of 10 matches on the card.</p>\n                <p>Noteworthy matches in the dual included No. 4 Max McEnelly beating No. 5 Dylan Fishback, 4-1, in sudden victory. McEnelly has performed under expectations up to this match after being a favorite in the weight class entering 2025-26, while Fishback has surged up rankings up until his match Friday.</p>\n                <p>Unranked Buckeyes\u2019 125-pounder Vincent Kilkeary upset no. 9 Jore Volk in sudden victory to set the tone. During the ensuing five-match win streak, 141-pound No. 1 Jesse Mendez delivered a 21-5 tech fall over No. 9 Vance Vombaur.</p>\n                <p>Notable news for the Buckeyes is that 157-pound No.1 Brandon Cannon is out with a knee injury, which is expected to keep him out for multiple weeks. He is uncertain to return for their dual with Penn State on Feb. 13.</p>\n                <p>Nebraska, on the other hand, spent their Friday night losing to Iowa at home. Hawkeyes\u2019 coach Tom Brands earned his 300th career win in the 22-14 victory.</p>\n                <p>The victory came behind a couple of upsets by the Hawkeyes. At 133, No. 10 Drake Ayala upset No. 8 Jacob Van Dee, 12-6, and at 184, Gabe Arnold upset No. 7 Silas Allred, 4-1.</p>\n                <p>On Sunday, Nebraska and Ohio State met in Columbus in a dual decided by a single point.</p>\n                <p>The dual started with four straight Buckeye victories, getting Ohio State out to a 14-0 lead. One of those wins saw Mendez get revenge over No. 3 Brock Hardy in a national final rematch. Mendez won 14-3 via major decision.</p>\n                <p>Once the bout reached 157 pounds, Nebraska turned the tides. No. 5 Antrell Taylor\u2019s major decision over Maddox Shaw set off a run of five straight wins to give Nebraska a 16-14 lead with one match to go. Nebraska saw upsets at 174 pounds, with No. 6 Christopher Minto defeating No. 4 Carson Kharchla. At 184-pounds Allred beat Fishback in tiebreakers during the streak.</p>\n                <p>The dual came down to a heavyweight rematch between No. 3 Nick Feldman and No. 4 AJ Ferrari. The match went into sudden victory, where Feldman took down Ferrari to secure Ohio State\u2019s 17-16 win.</p>\n                <p>Rest of conference</p>\n                <p>The rest of the Big Ten saw a smattering of blowouts around the Midwest, with the exception of another one-point swing in Champaign, Illinois. The No. 12 Fighting Illini beat No. 17 Rutgers on a criteria tiebreaker after the matches concluded tied 16-16.</p>\n                <p>The teams traded back-to-back wins for the first four weight classes, before Illinois pulled away slightly, up 13-6. At 174 pounds, Ryan Ford upset No. 25 Colin Kelly with a major decision to bring the Scarlet Knights back into it.</p>\n                <p>Rutgers trailed 16-13 entering the heavyweight bout when No. 19 Hunter Catka took a sudden-victory decision to knot the dual at 16.</p>\n                <p>Illinois was awarded the decisive point on third criteria, which is awarded to the total individual scoring across the 10 matches, where it had a 46-42 edge.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>The People\u2019s Defense Front and Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity (SCDS) held a vigil and protest Monday night at Old Main to honor Alex Pretti, who was shot and killed Saturday during Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis.</p>\n                <p>The death of Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse working for the Veterans Administration, occurred a little over two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent. Good\u2019s death sparked protests in both State College and across the country.</p>\n                <p>Elise Groff, who also participated in the Renee Good protest, said she felt disturbed with Pretti\u2019s death and what it says about the current climate in the United States.</p>\n                <p>\u201dICE killed a man in Minneapolis and the government's lying about that,\u201d Groff, a fourth-year studying chemistry, said. \u201cI'm surprised there aren't more people out here.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Groff said she hoped the vigil and protest would give Pretti\u2019s family comfort by showing they are not alone in grieving for their loss, and that the protest would help spread further awareness to others who may not be well-informed about his death.</p>\n                <p>The vigil began at 7 p.m. and saw hundreds of protestors lead through chants of \u201cSay his name: Alex Pretti,\u201d \u201cSay her name: Renee Good\u201d and \u201cFuera La Migra (ICE out).\u201d</p>\n                <p>During the protest, a red car attempted to drive through the crowd at the Allen Street light with a protester jumping onto the vehicle and punching the windshield before the car drove away.</p>\n                <p>Carter Davis said he was appalled by attempts from the federal government to cover up the details surrounding Pretti\u2019s death.</p>\n                <p>State College police said no reports have been made about any incidents from the protest.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI feel like everyone here saw what happened in Minneapolis, which is kind of pretty clear,\u201d Davis, a second-year studying secondary education, said. \u201cIt's just not right.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Davis said he believes change must happen soon in order to prevent further bloodshed.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'd like to hope that someone's listening but if they're not listening, we can at least try to be heard by being loud and outspoken,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI hope we should start to get people's attention so that they start thinking critically about what's going on and just stir up some sort of action. Maybe you can get more people to just come to the protests and just speak out against what's going on, just cause it's terrible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Protestors were guided to march from Old Main and into downtown State College, holding signs that said \u201cDrive out ICE,\u201d \u201cI prefer my ICE crushed\u201d and \u201cMake racists afraid again.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The march ended at Old Main at 8:15 p.m. with organizers from the SCDS and People's Defense Front urging those in attendance to sign up for neighborhood patrols and continue coming together to hold future events.</p>\n                <p>An SCDS spokesperson, who requested anonymity for fear of their personal safety, said they hoped the protest\u2019s message would reverberate across multiple channels and ways.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI'm hoping that people in Minneapolis see that people in a relatively small rural part of Pennsylvania stand with them,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cI'm hoping that Penn State sees what students want, what the community wants, and doesn't allow ICE to come on campus, doesn't revoke student visas, and I'm hoping that ICE sees this and knows that people are gonna take action if they plan to come here and we're prepared.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Elliott Inscho | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s been a rough season for Penn State women\u2019s basketball, and the struggle continued when the Lady Lions took on Oregon and No. 25 Washington last week.</p>\n                <p>The team\u2019s road trip to the Pacific Northwest saw the blue and white remain winless in Big Ten play, losing by a combined 46 points to the former Pac-12 foes.</p>\n                <p>After the two losses, the Lady Lions are 7-14 on the season, and in the midst of a ten-game losing streak. They\u2019ve won just one of their last 14 games, that victory coming over VCU on Dec. 20.</p>\n                <p>Shooting inefficiency</p>\n                <p>While Penn State went a relatively acceptable 40.6% from the field in the two losses, several key players had poor shooting performances that contributed to the failing efforts.</p>\n                <p>Against Washington, guard Kiyomi McMiller shot 5-for-17 from the field and 28.6% from inside the arc. Fellow guard T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante also struggled, posting a 36.4% shooting percentage and going just 20% from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>Cl\u00e8ante\u2019s poor shooting continued against Oregon, as the French freshman shot 16.7% overall and 0-for-4 from deep.</p>\n                <p>Shaelyn Steele and Vitoria Santana each went 2-for-7 from the field against Oregon, contributing to a team shooting percentage of 39%. With the Ducks shooting a far more efficient 57%, it would\u2019ve been a tall task for the Lady Lions to come out on top.</p>\n                <p>If Penn State is going to pick up a Big Ten victory by season\u2019s end, it will need to find better shooting form, particularly from its star players.</p>\n                <p>Charity stripe challenges</p>\n                <p>In the matchups with Washington and Oregon, the Lady Lions struggled mightily when they found themselves at the free throw line.</p>\n                <p>Against Washington, Penn State went 3-for-9 from the line, while the Huskies shot 12-for-15. Washington got more opportunities, but being outshot by nearly 50 percentage points at the free throw line is generally not congruent with victory.</p>\n                <p>The same theme held true against Oregon, where the Lady Lions shot 50% from the charity stripe in comparison to the Ducks\u2019 85%.</p>\n                <p>Making more free throws wouldn\u2019t have made up the 30 point deficit that Penn State lost by, but poor free throw shooting has been a common theme throughout the season. Through 21 games, the Lady Lions are shooting a combined 65.3% at the line, a rate that ranks last in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Still searching for Big Ten success</p>\n                <p>Last season, coach Carolyn Kieger and the Lady Lions won just a single conference game, and they\u2019re on pace to come up short of that mark this year.</p>\n                <p>Last week saw the Big Ten struggles get even worse, with the loss to Oregon marking the third time the Lady Lions lost by 30 or more points this year. A 36-point deficit to UCLA and a 40-point dismantling by Michigan earlier in the season slotted the loss to the Ducks as the third-worst of the season.</p>\n                <p>Under Kieger, the blue and white posted two seasons with just a single conference win. One came last year, and the other was her debut campaign as Penn State\u2019s head coach.</p>\n                <p>While the conference slate has been ugly so far, there\u2019s ample opportunity to get an elusive Big Ten victory. There are still two ranked teams left to play, No. 13 Michigan State and No. 15 Maryland, but there are easier games to follow.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions still have to play Northwestern, Rutgers and Indiana, which rank No. 15, No. 16 and No. 17 in the Big Ten, respectively. Coming in the final weeks of the season, those matchups will be the best opportunity for Kieger and Penn State to get on the board in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s basketball suffered two double-digit losses in its West Coast trip to Washington and Oregon last week, falling to 7-14 on the season. The Lady Lions are still searching for their first Big Ten win since Jan. 19, 2025.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white have eight games left this season to find its footing and earn a conference victory, starting with a battle against Minnesota.</p>\n                <p>Tipoff is set for 6 p.m. Wednesday in Rec Hall, and the meeting with the Golden Gophers is Penn State\u2019s National Girls and Women in Sports Day game.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota is 14-6, with its win column highlighted by a victory over then-No. 21 USC, while suffering close losses to then-No. 7 Maryland and then-No. 9 Michigan.</p>\n                <p>In the Gophers\u2019 most recent outing, they convincingly defeated Wisconsin 88-53. Sophomore guard Tori McKinney was the game's leading scorer with 20 points. The Minnetonka, Minnesota, native is the team's second-highest scorer this season, averaging 12.5 points per game.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions\u2019 last game against Oregon was a tale of two halves. After trailing 40-34 at halftime, the blue and white fell 89-59. Freshman Nyla McFadden and sophomore Kiyomi McMiller each scored a team-high 15 points.</p>\n                <p>Penn State played without 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle after suffering a head injury in the previous game against Washington. Merkle is the Lady Lions\u2019 leading scorer at 19.3 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Minnesota\u2019s scoring effort is led by 5-foot-10 junior guard Grace Grocholski, who averages 14 points per game and is a top shooter in the Big Ten with 2.6 made three pointers per game. The North Prairie, Wisconsin, native enters Wednesday's matchup after an 18-point performance in which she shot 6-for-7 from field-goal range and 4-for-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n                <p>The Gophers present tough guard play thanks to the likes of Grocholski and McKinney; the Lady Lions will look for a strong outing from their backcourt, which is led by McMiller and redshirt junior Moriah Murray.</p>\n                <p>McMiller is the blue and white's second leading scorer, averaging 18.8 points per game. Murray averages 9.5 points per game, and matches Grocholski\u2019s scoring from deep by also netting 2.6 three pointers per contest.</p>\n                <p>Both teams own a nearly similar total points per game average, with Penn State averaging 74.4 points, compared to Minnesota\u2019s 74.2. The bigger outlier between the two opponents comes from the defensive side of the ball.</p>\n                <p>Statistically, the Gophers have the best defense in the Big Ten, allowing just 54.2 points per game, and this number also ranks in the top-10 nationally.</p>\n                <p>On the other hand, the Lady Lions have the conference\u2019s worst defense, with opponents averaging 82.3 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Wednesday\u2019s matchup presents Penn State with both a clear challenge and an opportunity. If the Lady Lions can generate consistent offense from their guards while tightening up defensively, they\u2019ll give themselves a chance to crack Minnesota\u2019s elite defense and potentially break through in conference play.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

Four of the five wrestlers placed at the invitational.</p>\n                <p>Hayden Cunningham was the first to wrestle for the Nittany Lions. Cunningham wrestled at 141 pounds and had an overall record of 2-2 for the weekend. The redshirt freshman registered a major-decision victory and placed fourth.</p>\n                <p>At 149, Dalton Perry competed for Penn State, recovering from his knee injury that he suffered at the Army Black Knight Invitational in November. The freshman went 2-1 with a major decision-victory and placed second.</p>\n                <p>At 174, the Nittany Lions had two wrestlers compete in Sam Beckett and Sean Degl. Degl went 2-2 and had a rougher outing than Beckett. Beckett also went 2-2, but had a tech-fall victory and placed fourth in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Rounding it out at 285 pounds, Dawson Bundy wrestled the most out of any of the other Penn State competitors. Bundy went 2-0 in collegiate matches and 1-2 in non-collegiate matches. The redshirt freshman also had a tech-fall victory and placed fourth.</p>\n                <p>Transfers</p>\n                <p>Oklahoma State was supposed to have two matches last weekend, but the match against Utah Valley got postponed. That match could\u2019ve contained three former Nittany Lions, with 149-pounder David Evans being on Utah Valley, but the Cowboys only had their match against Missouri. Oklahoma State defeated Missouri 33-3.</p>\n                <p>Of the Oklahoma State contingent who were in action, No. 7 Alex Facundo at 174 pounds wrestled a former All-American in No. 10 Cam Steed. The match was tight, but Facundo got the better of Steed, defeating him 2-1. Facundo now has four-ranked wins with his last two being Steed and No. 8 Carter Schubert of Oklahoma.</p>\n                <p>At 184 Pounds, No. 8 Zack Ryder continues to struggle against wrestlers ranked higher than him. The Cowboy dropped his match, 4-1, after No. 3 Aeoden Sinclair got a takedown in the later parts of the third period. That is Ryder\u2019s fifth loss of the season.</p>\n                <p>Jack Kelly got some action for George Mason against Edinboro. Kelly bumped up from 184 to 197 in this one, and it didn\u2019t go in his favor. Kelly lost by decision, 8-4, to Brody Evans which led to Edinboro getting the victory over the Patriots.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>As coach Jeff Kampersal made his way back from a European hockey camp, he knew Jessica Adolfsson had the potential to be a great Penn State athlete. Little did he know she would make it to the Olympics and represent her country twice.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBelieve in the process and be patient with yourself,\u201d Adolfsson told The Daily Collegian. \u201cSurround yourself with people who support you, and don\u2019t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone. If you\u2019re willing to work consistently and stay passionate, those dreams are possible.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With those goals and that mindset, Adolfsson earned her spot in the 2022 and 2026 Olympics to represent Sweden in women\u2019s ice hockey.</p>\n                <p>While Kampersal knew she would be a star in the future, many of Adolfsson\u2019s teammates saw that skillset in her when she joined the Nittany Lions in 2018.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJess had a very clear standard for herself and for how she showed up every day,\u201d Chantal Burke, a former teammate of Adolfsson, told the Collegian. \u201cShe was consistent, driven and quietly confident. On the ice, she played with purpose. That combination of internal motivation, self-awareness and work ethic is what made it easy to believe she could reach the Olympic level.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After playing a limited role in the first two games of the season, Adolfsson had a huge effort on Oct. 5, 2018, against Merrimack, when she recorded her first assist after five shots.</p>\n                <p>A few weeks later, she earned her first goal on a last-minute power play against Robert Morris and tallied her first multi-point game against Cornell.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJessica just had a lot of presence as a (defender), good stature, a really good skater, really good puck mover and a cannon for a shot,\u201d Kampersal told the Collegian. \u201cShe came to Penn State and hit the ground running with no issues whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Adolfsson\u2019s quick success was made evident on the ice, but her teammates and coaches saw her success in the locker room becoming even more prevalent.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the locker room, she brought sincerity and accountability,\u201d Burke said. \u201cShe shared pieces of herself in genuine moments and wasn\u2019t afraid to connect on a deeper level, which built trust and brought the team closer together.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After scoring two goals and five assists through the first few months of action, Adolfsson finished the season on a hot streak with three goals and two assists through February and the first week of March.</p>\n                <p>Adolfsson\u2019s freshman success was evident following her postseason awards, being named to the CHA All-Rookie team after ranking third among CHA freshmen defenders in scoring.</p>\n                <p>In just her second season with the Nittany Lions, Adolfsson was named an alternate captain before ultimately sustaining a season-ending injury just five weeks into the season. During this time, Adolfsson\u2019s interactions with her team became more important as her efforts weren\u2019t possible on the ice.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(Jessica) loved poetry and learning, and she would genuinely share what she was studying or thinking about with me,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThose moments showed a depth to her that people might not have seen from the stands. She was very intentional with her words and her actions, and you could tell she knew what she wanted from herself and from her team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>What she wanted was on display when she came back from injury, playing in all 21 games of the season after she returned on Nov. 29, 2020.</p>\n                <p>In the following game, Adolfsson returned to her peak form with a goal from the defensive end. A little over a month later, she had the only two-goal game of her career against Robert Morris, as she tallied four goals and seven assists on the season.</p>\n                <p>Adolfsson ultimately departed from Penn State after just three years, as she joined Link\u00f6ping HC in the Swedish Women\u2019s Hockey League.</p>\n                <p>Despite cutting her collegiate career short, the Link\u00f6ping, Sweden, native made her mark on Happy Valley, both on the ice and off.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn my opinion, her greatest legacy is bringing that sort of professional approach to the team culture and commitment,\u201d Kampersal said.</p>\n                <p>After combining for just 23 points in her two seasons in the SWHL before joining Penn State, Adolfsson scored 25 points off 6 goals and 19 assists in her first year back in 2021.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPenn State prepared me tremendously,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cThe experience I gained at PSU taught me how to be consistent, handle pressure and elevate my game in big moments.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The biggest moment of her career came just a year after leaving Penn State, as she was named to represent the Swedish women\u2019s hockey team at the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIt felt like one of those moments where you think, \u2018This just makes sense.\u2019 Seeing her make her first Olympic team in 2022 is a testament to her growth, resilience and commitment to her passion for hockey.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Adolfsson prepared for the big game, she adapted her collegiate training style from the typical six-month season she had previously experienced to a new two-and-a-half week Olympic tournament.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe preparation has been very detailed and intentional,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cThere\u2019s more emphasis on short-term performance, international systems and team chemistry in a condensed time frame. It\u2019s different from a long college season, but the focus and intensity are extremely high.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sweden opened the 2022 Olympic Games with two 3-1 losses to Japan and Czechia before earning a 2-1 win against China and a 3-1 win against Denmark.</p>\n                <p>While Adolfsson and Sweden ultimately lost 11-0 in the quarterfinals to Canada, finishing eighth overall, she strongly cherished the moment representing her country.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWearing Sweden\u2019s jersey is something I never take for granted,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cIt represents playing for everyone back home and honoring our hockey tradition and competing with heart every time I step on the ice.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After another year of action with Link\u00f6ping HC, Adolfsson moved to HV71 of the SDHL before moving across the Atlantic to the Ottawa Charge of the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League. She only played one game in Canada before returning home to Sweden to join SDE HF in the SDHL.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt makes me incredibly proud of her, especially as someone who understands all the highs and lows, blood, sweat and tears that are unavoidable through the trajectory of a unique hockey career,\u201d Burke said.</p>\n                <p>Over the past month, Adolfsson was named one of four Penn State athletes to represent her country at the 2026 Olympic Games, marking her second appearance at the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPenn State is developing players who can compete at the highest level, and seeing that reflected on the international stage speaks to the coaching, culture and commitment within the program,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cSharing that experience with Nicole (Hall) makes it even better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Adolfsson enters the Olympics at 27 years old, Kampersal hopes she can make the most of her experience later in her career.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m super excited because she\u2019s getting on with her career,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThese opportunities are very few and come every four years, so I\u2019m super excited and proud of her to represent Team Sweden in Italy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After an eighth-place finish in her first Olympic Games, Adolfsson doesn\u2019t have an exact placement in mind ahead of 2026, but is hoping for success with her team.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe believe in our group and our preparation,\u201d Adolfsson said. \u201cOur expectation is to compete hard every game, play our style of hockey and continue to grow throughout the tournament.

    "description": "<p>After coming two goals short of a national championship appearance last season, Penn State has a shot at another strong campaign in 2026.</p>\n                <p>Last year saw the Nittany Lions go 12-5, with wins over No. 10 Notre Dame, No. 13 Michigan and eventual national champion No. 3 Cornell, though the Big Red would end the blue and white\u2019s season in the NCAA semifinals.</p>\n                <p>This season, the Nittany Lions are ranked No. 7 in the season-opening Inside Lacrosse rankings. While the blue and white are a well-rounded group, a few players could help push that ranking higher with strong seasons.</p>\n                <p>Hunter Aquino</p>\n                <p>Aquino made a quick name for himself in 2025, being named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year following a 16-goal debut season. The 6-foot-5 midfielder\u2019s 37 total points ranked second on the team, behind only Matt Traynor.</p>\n                <p>With Traynor graduating following last season, Aquino is likely to step into an even larger role in 2026. The Easton, Pennsylvania, native got first-line reps last year, but with Traynor gone, he\u2019ll be the clear-cut first option midfielder for Penn State.</p>\n                <p>After being named a second-team All-American by Inside Lacrosse as a freshman, an offseason of development and increased workload could make for an even larger breakout by Aquino this season.</p>\n                <p>Alex Ross</p>\n                <p>Ross was named to the All-Big Ten Second Team and an Inside Lacrosse All-American Honorable Mention in 2025. To start 2026, he\u2019s been named as a Big Ten Player to Watch alongside Aquino and defensive midfielder Jon King.</p>\n                <p>The 6-foot-1 senior caused 15 turnovers in 2025, a mark that ranked second-most by any Nittany Lion. Similar to Aquino, Ross will see an increased role with the departure of Kevin Parnham, and is likely to take on the most challenging attack matchups in each game.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defense allowed a solid 9.4 goals per game last season, a mark that ranked No. 14 in the nation, and Ross was a major factor in that strong performance. The unit will be shaken up a bit in 2026, but the Davidsonville, Maryland, native is likely to have another strong season.</p>\n                <p>Liam Matthews</p>\n                <p>The redshirt sophomore scored 28 goals last season, second-most on the team, trailing only the aforementioned Traynor. The Orangeville, Ontario, native\u2019s 34 total points ranked fourth-most, and second among returning players.</p>\n                <p>Matthews\u2019 scoring total came on a 40% shooting percentage, which led all Nittany Lions who took more than four shots last season. That efficiency will be valued on an offensive unit that needs to replace a lot of production with Traynor\u2019s departure.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white scored 12.3 goals per game last season, ranking No. 21 nationally. Matthews and the rest of the attack unit are poised to improve on that mark in 2026.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

It\u2019s said that traditions, experiments that worked, are often monolithically labeled as outdated, oppressive or unfair.</p>\n                <p>But what if most traditions are positive social integrators that mark time and place?</p>\n                <p>I\u2019d bet we could all agree that most rituals are not the demons we make them out to be.</p>\n                <p>For example, Penn State used to have class dances. There was the Soph Hop, the Junior Prom, and the Senior Ball.</p>\n                <p>Now, maybe these disappeared due to class sizes and space constraints, but how much fun would a class-wide university dance function be? There\u2019d be a King and Queen and all sorts of fun aspects.</p>\n                <p>These dances, though just a minor example, are full of symbology. They marked the experience of getting older each year and enjoying social settings with our peers. There\u2019s nothing unfair or oppressive about it.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, Penn State used to have all sorts of annual competitions and exhibitions.</p>\n                <p>For example, there used to be an annual All-College Circus in Rec Hall where outstanding members of student orgs were presented to their peers and applauded for their meaningful contributions.</p>\n                <p>We had an annual livestock exhibition held by a club, complete with a co-ed pig race and a meat auction \u2014 a representation of our agricultural roots. This tradition began in 1916 with the last mention of it in The Daily Collegian in 1992 \u2014 its 75th anniversary.</p>\n                <p>Take a walk down memory lane with Penn State\u2019s archives, and you\u2019ll see a plethora of examples like these. But what happened to them? Where are all of our traditions now?</p>\n                <p>We have the White Out and Homecoming. What else?</p>\n                <p>Where are all of the silly traditions, the formal collegiate experiences, the collective activities marking a moment in time, or the uniqueness of a certain place?</p>\n                <p>Why have the past and the events from it been so collectively demonized?</p>\n                <p>Some say modernity is always a positive \u2014 a marker of moving forward. But when we move forward, do we have to leave everything behind? Can\u2019t we mix our modern day and age with the glories of the past, the experiments that worked?</p>\n                <p>Maybe, just maybe, traditions don\u2019t deserve to be constantly castigated and relegated to the dustbins of history.</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State is still looking for its first Big Ten win of the season, and that search will continue as another conference loss happened Monday night.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 youthful roster couldn't overcome an 18-point halftime deficit while facing Ohio State, losing 84-78 inside the Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio. Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad dropped to 9-11 on the year and 0-9 in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>Penn State opened the second half on a 27-10 run, cutting Ohio State\u2019s lead down to 60-59 after an and-1 jumper by forward Josh Reed with 10:46 left in the game. The Nittany Lions were consistently threatening the lead early in the second half with wing Eli Rice slimming it down to 58-54 at the 11:57 mark.</p>\n                <p>But as Penn State came close to taking its first lead of the game, the Buckeyes went on a quick 5-0 run behind two free throws and a 3-pointer by guard John Mobley Jr., guiding his squad to a 69-61 advantage. The two squads battled, but Mobley got Ohio State back to a double-digit cushion with another 3-pointer to make it a 74-63 game with 6:38 left.</p>\n                <p>Guard Melih Tunca made multiple baskets down the stretch to keep Penn State in it, and Rice brought the Nittany Lions down 80-76 after a 3-pointer with 23 seconds left. However, it wasn\u2019t enough to fully complete a comeback after late free throws by Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>It was the third-straight game Penn State was losing by 18 points or more at halftime as the Buckeyes led 50-32 at the break. Despite entering the game averaging only 9.1 turnovers per game, the Nittany Lions had 10 turnovers in the first half and only shot 41% from the field.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State, on the other hand, shot 66.7% from the field and 54.5% from 3-point range during the first half. The Buckeyes mounted a 14-2 run midway through the half, and even while Penn State cut the lead to 10 points, they temporarily stopped any comeback from happening with a 12-4 run near the end of the half.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 offense was led by Rice, who totaled a team-high 20 points. Seven-footer Ivan Juri\u0107, Tunca and Reed were all in double figures as well, with the team shooting 50% from the field, 40% from 3-point range and 86% at the stripe.</p>\n                <p>Juri\u0107 registered a double-double with 14 rebounds as well, winning the rebound battle for Penn State, 31 to 21.</p>\n                <p>Ohio State had three players in double figures: Mobley, forward Devin Royal and forward Amare Bynum. Mobley paced the Buckeyes with 25 points, and Ohio State shot 56% from the field, 34.8% from 3-point range and 76.2% at the free-throw line.</p>\n                <p>Monday\u2019s game also saw former Penn State player Puff Johnson in action for Ohio State. Johnson had two points and three rebounds in 14 minutes during his second appearance of the season for the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>Injury report</p>\n                <p>Rotational forward Tibor Mirti\u010d remained listed as \u201cout\u201d on the Big Ten availability report.

    "author": "AJ Piazza | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State will need to have guys step up at the attack position after losing some key pieces in Matt Traynor and Will Peden. The squad also lost key point-getters in Jack Aimone and Ethan Long.</p>\n                <p>Traynor was selected No. 6 overall by the New York Atlas and impressed in his rookie season. Despite the blue and white losing some key contributors, there are a ton of names who could step up this season.</p>\n                <p>Kyle Lehman and Hunter Aquino are expected to be key pieces as attackers.</p>\n                <p>Lehman saw much more time in his sophomore season than he did in his rookie season, and the growth showed. He had a career high in goals with 26 and points with 33. With Lehman being one of the main ball handlers, he\u2019ll be able to spread the ball around more. The junior improved his shot last season and will look to add more assists to the stat sheet.</p>\n                <p>Aquino will now play attack after being a midfielder last season. The Big Ten Freshman of the Year impressed in his first season. Aquino only started nine games but tallied 37 points, including 21 assists. The sophomore had an injury that forced him to slow down during the NCAA Tournament, but the Easton, Pennsylvania native will be focused on potting in points in his first year as an attackman.</p>\n                <p>Liam Matthews became an important piece during the second half of the season. Despite only starting seven games, Matthews was second on the team in goals with 28. He had the highlight of two behind-the-back goals against Cornell and is expected to have more highlights this season.</p>\n                <p>The depth beyond these three attackmen is thin and unknown. The only player to appear in a collegiate game is Wesley Scurci, who played in two games last season and in 12 games for Lindenwood in 2022-23. The redshirt junior didn\u2019t have any points for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Jack Iannantunono was ranked as the No. 60 player in the 2025 class, according to Inside Lacrosse.

    "author": "Taylor McGillvray | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State filed a lawsuit against several major healthcare companies on Jan. 13 alleging that they intentionally increased insulin prices. The university claims the price hikes forced its self-funded healthcare system, which covers staff, faculty, retirees and their dependents, to pay artificially high costs for diabetes medications.</p>\n                <p>The average cost of some diabetes medication has risen more than ten times the amount average consumer goods and services have over the past two decades, according to court documents. The lawsuit alleges that the price increase is not a result of market-driven variables, but the medication was instead engineered by the companies in a way that would increase their profit.</p>\n                <p>Manufacturing defendants Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk allegedly raised prices on purpose to maximize their profit margins within a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d rebate system. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx, along with their parent companies Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealthcare, allegedly created the financial incentives that increased the price.</p>\n                <p>The companies are being sued for fraudulent concealment, violating Pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment.</p>\n                <p>Insulin prices have been quickly increasing over the last twenty years, however, the process of manufacturing the drug has decreased, according to court documents. In 1990, a vial cost as little as $2 to produce, and was priced at $20. Now, the same vials range anywhere from $300 to over $700. The relevant period for the alleged claims is 2008 through the present.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 continuous contacts and conduct within the Commonwealth established a strong nexus among defendants, this forum and the claims at issue, making the exercise of jurisdiction proper and fair.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 listed above were active in Pennsylvania, and their actions directly impacted residents, so the case is to be handled by a court and a requested jury.</p>\n                <p>The defendants\u2019 listed above were actively selling insulin in Pennsylvania, and their actions directly impacted residents, including those at the Pennsylvania State University.

    "description": "<p>Following a seven-game road trip, No. 4 women\u2019s hockey returned to Pegula Ice Arena for the final stretch of conference games before the end of the season.</p>\n                <p>This past weekend, the Nittany Lions hosted the Delaware Fightin\u2019 Blue Hens, completing the first season series against the newest AHA team. With a 5-0 on Friday followed by a 7-0 win on Saturday, Penn State took the season series 4-0.</p>\n                <p>Over the four games played, the blue-and-white outscored Delaware 24-0 and outshot them 191-30.</p>\n                <p>Penn State extended its win streak to five games and kept its record at home perfect, sitting at 11-0.</p>\n                <p>Hockey history</p>\n                <p>With the 5-0 win in Friday\u2019s contest, Penn State coach Jeff Kampersal became the fifth coach in Division-I women\u2019s hockey to earn 500 wins in his career.</p>\n                <p>Sitting fifth on the all-time list, Kampersal now chases Katey Stone, the Harvard coach who earned 523 wins while leading the crimson-and-white over 28 seasons.</p>\n                <p>After stopping all 12 shots she faced on Saturday, Katie DeSa recorded her eighth shutout of the season and the 21st of her career, passing Josie Bothun, a member of the 2024 squad, for the most shutouts by any goalie in Penn State hockey history.</p>\n                <p>DeSa\u2019s eight shutouts are tied for the most in the nation with Quinnipiac\u2019s Felicia Frank.</p>\n                <p>Maddy Campbell also recorded a shutout on Friday, her fourth of the season, giving her a tie for the most single-season shutouts by a freshman in program history.</p>\n                <p>Conference champs</p>\n                <p>For the fourth consecutive season, Penn State is the AHA Regular Season Champion. The Nittany Lions secured the title in their win over Delaware on Saturday, earning them home-ice advantage in the upcoming AHA Tournament beginning in February.</p>\n                <p>Penn State joined the Mercyhurst Lakers as the only two teams in conference history to win the regular season championship in at least four consecutive seasons.</p>\n                <p>With six conference games remaining, the Kampersal and the Nittany Lions are now two wins shy of tying their program record of 19 wins set just last season.</p>\n                <p>Seniors shine</p>\n                <p>On Saturday, Penn State took the time to honor those who will be graduating in the Class of 2026 with a postgame ceremony for the following seniors: Kendall Butze, Maddy Christian, DeSa, Taylor Lum, Katelyn Roberts, Leah Stecker and Mya Vaslet.</p>\n                <p>With five points over the weekend from two goals and three assists, Butze tied Lyndie Lobdell, 2025, for the Penn State record for most career points by a defenseman with 84.</p>\n                <p>Janecke, with three points over the weekend, scored two goals on Saturday and extended her point streak to eight games. The captain totaled 13 points on eight goals and five assists during her streak.</p>\n                <p>Christian and Vaslet each accumulated three points over the two games. Lum, Roberts and Stecker each recorded two.</p>\n                <p>Outwater on a roll</p>\n                <p>Grace Outwater\u2019s goal on Saturday gave the Nittany Lions a 5-0 lead in the second period. The sophomore winger has scored in each of her last five games and extended her point streak to six games.</p>\n                <p>Her goal on Saturday was also her 18th of the year, breaking Janecke\u2019s record for goals by a sophomore set during the 2023-24 season.</p>\n                <p>Second line shooters</p>\n                <p>The second line of forwards Christian, Mikah Keller and Outwater set a goal for their line to have all three score a goal in Friday\u2019s contest, and they did that and more. The three skaters combined for six points, with each tallying a goal and an assist.</p>\n                <p>Outwater opened the scoring with Keller notching an assist. With under three minutes remaining in the second period, Christian assisted on a Keller goal to give Penn State a 3-0 lead. With less than a minute left, Outwater sent a one-timer that Christian fired into the back of the net, completing their goal.</p>\n                <p>For Christian, it was the 15th time in her career she finished a game with at least one goal and one assist, tying her with Natalie Heising of 2022 for the third-most games in Penn State history.</p>\n                <p>With first-line center Janecke headed to Milano-Cortina for the Winter Olympics, the second line could look a little different when they take on the Robert Morris Colonials in the first-ever outdoor hockey game at Beaver Stadium on Friday at 1 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Jonathon Chiu | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly integrated into everyday life with virtually every Google search conducted today coming with AI overviews and access to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek not being far behind.</p>\n                <p>Stuart Selber, a professor of English and director of the Program of Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) in the College of Liberal Arts, said academic integrity cases involving AI usage are often \u201cblack-and-white\u201d due to representing a blatant cheating attempt.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe do have people just treating AI like an answering machine, feeding the assignment sheet in and asking for a finished assignment and handing it in,\u201d Selber said.</p>\n                <p>He said there are various AI usage policies across the different academic colleges and that allows professors to make their own decisions regarding how AI can be used in their classroom.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI might have a teacher who teaches in the writing program who wants to ban AI, that's up to them,\u201d Selber said. \u201cI don't think that's a good idea, myself, because I think we should wrestle with it because we're trying to prepare you to wrestle with it in the workplace so we need to wrestle with it in the classroom.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Ibukun Osunbunmi, an assistant research professor in the College of Engineering, said it was important for professors to be transparent with their AI usage policies and believed such discussions would cause a reduction in academic integrity violations.</p>\n                <p>When advising a colleague about how AI can be used in their course, Osunbunmi said it was important for students to first learn lesson materials without AI before they are given access to it, as a way to assist in solving complex problems.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI told him one of my mantras that \u2018If you cannot do it without AI, there's no (way) you can verify AI output,\u2019\u201d Osunbunmi, an assessment and instructional support specialist within the Leonhard Center for Enhancement of Engineering Education, said. \u201cI said \u2018Now that your students have mastered the fundamentals, now they know that AI can go wrong. They'll be careful not to use it or, even if they use it, they will check it and they have done it in a safe space where they are being guided.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>Osunbunmi said he\u2019s currently working on a website resource for Penn State faculty to learn about how AI can be used in their courses. He said there needs to be more accessible resources and frequent discussion on how to effectively use AI in higher education.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhy there's some pushback to AI integration is because it's disrupting how we teach, it\u2019s disrupting how we learn,\u201d Osunbumni said. \u201cUltimately, it has a lot of potentials for use but the outcome will be based on deliberate, inflectional design and I perceive it's going to be a collection of people sitting together in a room and having these hardcore conversations.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Mark Morrisson said he and several of his colleagues are currently investigating how to broaden the ways students can leverage AI through a Bachelor of Arts to complement existing Bachelor of Science degrees already being taught in the Colleges of Engineering and Information Science and Technology (IST).</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe engineering one is about how to make AI, how to understand AI, and the IST one is more use apps, things like that, but what we wanted to achieve with a BA was thinking more about ethical, social, cultural implications of emerging technologies,\u201d Morrisson, a professor of English, said. \u201cLiberal art students fit this kind of thinking very, very well and so we wanted something that would draw students \u2026 to be thinking more capaciously about how to understand impacts and dynamics of emerging technologies.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said Penn State stands to benefit from providing ways to increase AI literacy among students.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere is a lot of disruption going on right now over AI and there's the kind of Luddite perspective of \u2018Let's just rewind and not use this,\u2019\u201d Morrisson said. \u201cWell, it's not possible to do that anymore so instead, whether just uncritically consuming it or hoping it'll just go away, there's a middle ground which is understanding it and really thinking it through like we do with all education at Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>David Fusco said he instructs his students to use AI as a tool to help them rather than a crutch to rely on.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the world of technology that most of my students end up going into, people are using AI in their technology-based jobs,\u201d Fusco, an associate teaching professor in the College of Information Science and Technology, said. \u201cFrom my own personal experience and the courses I teach, I think it's a disservice to students to not understand how to use AI properly.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He said he thinks it important that students learn how to effectively use AI due to it becoming an increasingly necessary skill in several industries.</p>\n                <p>Gregg Rogers, an associate teaching professor of English and PWR\u2019s associate director, said Penn State has a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to teach students about AI so they are both provided with a useful skill and inspired to pursue new ways in which the technology can be applied.</p>\n                <p>He said changes in Penn State\u2019s stances toward AI in recent years is the result of beginning to consider how to overcome its drawbacks \u2014 such as hallucinations, where LLMs generate faulty outputs \u2014 as well as its potential for misuse.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNone of these problems are going to be solved by not looking at it,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWe are all still learning about this thing which is what we're supposed to be doing \u2014 we're a university.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS CONTENT</p>",

    "title": "Column | Lost in Translation: The issues with book-to-film adaptations",
    "author": "Emma Strickling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Since it was released in late November, \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has snowballed into the sensation that it is today. Whether you\u2019ve seen it or not, you\u2019ve probably come across some aspect of the hockey romance online. But before it became such a worldwide phenomenon, its story was housed in the 368-page book of the same title written by Rachel Reid.</p>\n                <p>Whether there\u2019s a creative drought or not, Hollywood has always seemed to turn to their local library to find their latest project. Adaptations have been part of the movie industry since the beginning of film\u2019s history. Today, it\u2019s no different. Academy Award-nominated films \u201cHamnet\u201d and \u201cFrankenstein\u201d, which were released last year, both came from books.</p>\n                <p>Emerald Fennell\u2019s controversial adaptation of \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d will be released next month. The trailer of the movie suggests the film will frame the story as an erotic romance rather than focusing on the intensity, obsession, and at times cruelty that\u2019s present in Emily Bronte\u2019s novel.</p>\n                <p>Even the film\u2019s depiction of Heathcliff based on the casting choice, seems to directly contrast with the descriptions established within the book.</p>\n                <p>Evidently, book-to-movie adaptations can be difficult. But if the base story already exists, why is it so hard to produce a good adaptation?</p>\n                <p>I think, primarily, it lies within the film industry\u2019s fondness for capitalizing on stories that already exist. A recent survey revealed 63% of Americans are more likely to see a movie if it was based on a successful book, according to People Magazine. Basically, these adaptations are an easy way to make money, because people are familiar with the name.</p>\n                <p>With a well-known name comes expectations surrounding the film. People are going to want to see the characters in the world that has been described to them. However, creative control (and perhaps some arrogance as well) can end up steering the project further and further away from its origins, in an attempt at making the film something more palatable for the screen.</p>\n                <p>For those who aren\u2019t familiar with the original, it doesn\u2019t make much difference. But for those who are familiar, they end up feeling disappointed, repeating their mantra of \u201cthe book was better\u201d on the way out of the theater.</p>\n                <p>Time constraints don\u2019t help either. Generally speaking, the average book is around 200-400 pages, which is difficult to try and fit into a two-hour time frame. This leads to important plot lines being cut, leaving viewers feeling like something is missing.</p>\n                <p>This issue is probably why we\u2019re seeing more books turn into TV shows, which can sometimes be a better alternative to film, as there\u2019s more room to go in-depth into the story.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps these films shouldn\u2019t be solely looked at as \u201cadaptations.\u201d Yes, they are being adapted to fit the screen format. However, they are more of a translation of the source into TV shows or movies. Like any translation, there are versions that translate well and some that don\u2019t, but regardless of whether or not it\u2019s translated well, something will get lost in the process.</p>\n                <p>Tone and nuance are things that can be left omitted, leaving the material unlike the original and not quite right. Even if you read a book that was translated from a different language, it still wouldn\u2019t be exactly the same as the original because there\u2019s no such thing as an exact translation. This is the same for a book to movie adaptations as it\u2019s being translated from one language (literature) into another (film).</p>\n                <p>I caution filmmakers \u2014 because I know they are avid readers of my column \u2014 that, in order to make an adaptation, one must have an incredible familiarity with the source text. While no adaptation is 100% perfect, it could be close if there\u2019s an awareness, understanding and reverence of the book it comes from.</p>\n                <p>While some people aren\u2019t sticklers about every detail being exactly how it\u2019s written, if trying to equate a movie with the book it came from, then the adaptation should be as faithful as possible. If the source material is altered significantly in terms of plot, characters and setting then it shouldn\u2019t attempt to be passed off as a direct version of its origin.</p>\n                <p>While I do love both film and literature, I think their interaction with one another should be much more limited than we have seen and continue to see. Because honestly, how many film versions of one book do we need?</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Things haven\u2019t been great in Happy Valley recently, as Penn State endured a cold stretch fitting in magnitude to the nearly two feet of snow that hit the region.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions face Ohio State on Monday, with a whole emphasis on the athletic portion of their student-athlete duties. With both schools canceling classes, the contest against the Buckeyes seems as essential as ever, despite the rivalry implications.</p>\n                <p>Penn State dropped its last six and sits as one of two winless teams in the Big Ten, but the blue and white hit the road to Columbus with a chance to heat up along the way.</p>\n                <p>By the numbers</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and Ohio State excelled in certain areas of play but also have their shortcomings, and they are actually similar in many of those metrics. Obviously, the 13-6 Buckeyes outperform the 9-10 Nittany Lions heavily across most categories, scoring offense, team defense, rebounding and scoring efficiency inside the arc.</p>\n                <p>Despite these stats suggesting Ohio State cruises to victory due to those fundamental advantages, there are also intangibles where Penn State actually holds surprising favorability.</p>\n                <p>Beyond the arc, both are mediocre, if even that, shooters, and have comparable possession and assist averages.</p>\n                <p>Building on where the squads are similar is crucial for Mike Rhoades\u2019 Penn State team to find success, and they can also find optimism in the fact that the blue and white typically generate more steals and turn the ball over less than Ohio State.</p>\n                <p>This metric could result in Penn State opting to press for those turnovers, where it can create an advantage, which actually isn\u2019t a terrible idea. According to Evan Miyakawa\u2019s tempo ratings, they both rank similarly, with Penn State taking the edge and also playing more comfortably in faster-paced games than the Buckeyes.</p>\n                <p>Player personnel</p>\n                <p>When taking an analytical and literal approach, the Buckeyes again hold the advantage, with only the margins favoring Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Bruce Thornton leads Ohio State behind his over 20 points per game average, joined by two other upperclassmen and sophomore John Mobley Jr., the second-leading scorer, as the Buckeyes top offensive contributors.</p>\n                <p>The scarlet and gray possess a roster efficient at all levels, whether it's just a duo or trio or an overall five-man unit. However, the Nittany Lions, which largely tinkered with starting groups due to injury and a young core, actually possess a more efficient five-man lineup of Freddie Dilione V, Kayden Mingo, Josh Reed, Eli Rice and Ivan Juri\u0107.</p>\n                <p>That's a group for Penn State that Rhoades doesn\u2019t typically appear altogether, with Dilione and Mingo rotating in the backcourt, yet Rhoades may need to change that, as the unit posts a better observed efficiency rating.</p>\n                <p>Oh, hello again</p>\n                <p>Penn State enters Ohio State\u2019s campus for the first time this year, and for most of the roster, the first time.</p>\n                <p>Only Dilione and Dom Stewart returned for Penn State in last year's clash with the Buckeyes in State College, where it received a thumping in Rec Hall. On the contrary, Ohio State retained three starters, but most of its second unit is made up of new arrivals.</p>\n                <p>The player most familiar with this occasion will be former Penn State forward and current Buckeye sixth-year, Puff Johnson, who received a temporary waiver to return to action. Johnson will make his second appearance since his return against his old squad, after playing four minutes in a loss to Michigan.</p>\n                <p>Johnson is a key storyline to watch, and especially how he\u2019s handled by both squads in this one. Ohio State may opt to use his services due to his familiarity with Rhoades\u2019 scheme, while Penn State may know just the way to counter its former star.</p>\n                <p>Both squads face off in a primetime FS1 matchup on Monday at 7:00 p.m., and both have a chance to make a statement. For Penn State, it's to show it isn\u2019t done fighting or improving despite a difficult season.</p>\n                <p>At the same time, Ohio State has a chance to differentiate itself from the middle of the pack in the conference in emphatic fashion.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Maggie Hardy | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 8 Penn State began a gauntlet of Big Ten contests Friday night, facing three of the top-five teams in the next trio of series, starting with No. 5 Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>After the Nittany Lions\u2019 dominant 7-2 win in their first meeting with the Badgers, the two were back for a Saturday night rematch at the Kohl Center.</p>\n                <p>Penn State secured the series sweep with a 3-1 comeback win Saturday night.</p>\n                <p>The physicality of Big Ten contests is nothing new.</p>\n                <p>Following a five-penalty first period on Friday night, the blue and white\u2019s rematch with the Badgers began with the same theme.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were first to the power play. Wisconsin\u2019s Jack Horbach laid a high hit on defenseman Nick Fascia, and although immediately reviewed for a major penalty, the forward was only awarded a two-minute minor.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s powerplay came inches from an early score, but a tic-tac-toe passing play captained by Gavin McKenna was eventually stuffed at the doorstep by Wisconsin goaltender Daniel Hauser.</p>\n                <p>The prime opportunity quickly dissolved for the Nittany Lions, and after a bouncing puck was intercepted off forward Matt DiMarsico\u2019s stick, Wisconsin\u2019s Tyson Dyck sent Christian Fitzgerald on a shorthanded breakaway.</p>\n                <p>Fitzgerald snuck his shot through the five-hole of goaltender Kevin Riedler, and gave the Badgers a 1-0 lead just under seven minutes into the first period.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s early momentum stalled after Wisconsin\u2019s goal, and the remaining minutes of the first frame were a back-and-forth effort.</p>\n                <p>With just over a minute to go in the period, the Nittany Lions were given a second chance on the man-advantage after one of the Badgers\u2019 top producers, Quinn Finley, was called for hooking.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white couldn\u2019t get one through as the buzzer rang in the first period.</p>\n                <p>Although starting the middle frame with almost a minute remaining on the power play, Penn State remained scoreless and was still chasing a goal.</p>\n                <p>Like Friday\u2019s matchup, the Nittany Lions began the middle frame trailing the Badgers, but unlike the first meeting, there was no three-goal performance to erase the deficit.</p>\n                <p>The two top-10 ranked teams continued their evenly matched battle. Wisconsin held the slight 11-9 edge in shots, and each had an opportunity on the man-advantage, but neither could capitalize and add to the scoring.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers thought they doubled their lead with about three minutes to go after forward Ryan Botterill found the back of the net, but the officials immediately waived it off for goaltender interference.</p>\n                <p>A challenge by the Wisconsin bench led to a short review, which confirmed a defender colliding with Reidler before the score, and the first-period goal was still the only score heading into the final 20 minutes.</p>\n                <p>After 45 minutes of scoreless play, sophomore JJ Wiebusch found the equalizer for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>The Verona, Wisconsin, native got the Nittany Lions on the board in his hometown arena, after firing a shot from the high slot that found its way through traffic and into the back of the Badgers' net.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white picked up some momentum after Wiebusch\u2019s score, and just over eight minutes later, forward Reese Laubach doubled the lead.</p>\n                <p>An initial shot from DiMarsico sent a rebound out to Laubach, who finished the shot over a diving Hauser, and gave Penn State its first lead of the night with about seven minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions sealed the 3-1 comeback win and series sweep after McKenna potted an empty net goal in the remaining seconds of the third period.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State is back at home hosting No. 2 Michigan State, first slated for a 6 p.m. puck drop at Pegula Ice Arena on Jan. 30, before hitting the ice for the outdoor game at Beaver Stadium.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Caroline Riley | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Escaping frigid State College, Penn State men\u2019s gymnastics competed for the first time at the Sam Mikulak Invitational in Sarasota, Florida, named after the three-time Olympian and six-time U.S. national all-around champion.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions faced off against two collegiate teams, Illinois and Florida Storm, as well as the EVO Senior Men\u2019s Elite Team featuring two former Nittany Lions, Michael Jaroh and Josh Karnes.</p>\n                <p>Despite a still rings rotation which featured the two highest scores in the country this season, the blue and white tied for second with Illinois with a 317.650 behind EVO\u2019s 326.150</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>Brayden Erickson got the meet started on the floor, but was unable to showcase much control on his landings. He had a hop on his opening front double tuck and underrotated his full twisting double back dismount, taking a big step to the front and side for a 13.050.</p>\n                <p>Matt Underhill was cleaner in the second spot. He had small hops throughout, including on his double layout and front double pike, but just a small shuffle on his full twisting double back gave him a 13.550.</p>\n                <p>In his first floor routine of 2026, Luke Esparo put up a big 13.700. He had a hop in the wrong direction on his opening combination front double pike, but stuck his double twist along the side. He was underrotated on his dismount but had a solid effort overall.</p>\n                <p>Shaun Smith closed out the rotation with a flat 13.00 following a bounding step forward on his front double tuck and big hops on his full twisting double layout.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Bobby Alessio opened the rotation with a hit. His entire routine was packed with flair elements, and he managed to fly up into a handstand on his dismount for a 12.850.</p>\n                <p>Ritam Malik followed the redshirt sophomore with a 13.800. He had some form issues with leg separation after his one pommel work, but stayed on the horse and landed his dismount.</p>\n                <p>Ricky Perez kept the momentum moving. He competes in a tricky routine with Russian elements. The freshman was a bit slow to get up to his handstand, but dismounted cleanly for a 13.650.</p>\n                <p>Landson Simpson also put up a hit routine in the anchor position. He was dynamic and quick with his Thomas flairs, flying up to handstand for a season-high 13.850.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Bobby Haberstock opened the rotation with a low 11.550. He had some control issues throughout his strength elements, and then was unable to get his dismount around to his feet, landing on his stomach.</p>\n                <p>Akseli Karsikas got the team back on track with a 13.750. He also stumbled a bit on his dismount, taking a large step forward, but putting it to his feet.</p>\n                <p>Needing a big score, elite rings competitor Underhill came through in a huge way, putting up the best score in the nation so far this season. He was steady throughout, sticking his dismount cold for a massive 14.700.</p>\n                <p>Esparo closed out the rotation with a 14.300, the second-best score in the nation behind his teammate. The junior bent his elbow a bit on his final strength element and took two hops on his dismount, but helped Penn State bounce back after the fall in a big way.</p>\n                <p>At the halfway point, and despite Haberstock\u2019s fall, Penn State skyrocketed to the top of the pack with a 161.850. EVO trailed with a 161.100, followed by Illinois\u2019 160.000 and Florida Storm\u2019s 136.900.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>Penn State moved to the vault, where all four gymnasts competed a Tsuk two and a half with varying degrees of success.</p>\n                <p>Kellen Ryan started the rotation with a massive step to the right for a 13.750. Simpson underrotated his vault, sitting it down for a low 12.800.</p>\n                <p>Underhill bounced back with just a small hop on his landing for a 13.800. However, the highlight of the rotation was Smith, who stuck the blind landing cold for a rotation-high and season-high 14.150.</p>\n                <p>Penn State extended its lead over EVO to a full point heading into the final two rotations.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Five</p>\n                <p>Malik led off the parallel bars rotation cleanly. He had a few unnecessary hand movements early and took a big step to the side on his piked dismount, but scored a solid 12.900.</p>\n                <p>Esparo continued his big day for the Nittany Lions with a 13.500 after just a small hop back on his double pike dismount.</p>\n                <p>Kacper Garnczarek competed in the first routine of the day in the third slot. He opened strong but was unable to cleanly hit his handstand after a giant need to adjust both his hands to regain balance. He also took two hops on his double front dismount, which lowered his score to a 13.150.</p>\n                <p>Simpson anchored the rotation cleanly despite a big arch in his final handstand position and a large step forward on his dismount. He scored a 13.700 as Penn State dropped its lead, trailing EVO 269.600-270.500 into the final rotation.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Six</p>\n                <p>Ryan opened the highbar rotation. He caught his Coleman and Kovacs taking a small step forward on his dismount for a 12.750.</p>\n                <p>Esparo was unable to finish his day on a high note. He was too far away from the bar on his Kovacs and was unable to grab it. He caught the rest of his releases but had a huge hop back on his dismount, scoring a low 11.750.</p>\n                <p>Garnczarek got the team back on track with a 12.350. He caught his Coleman but had a big form break late in the routine, separating his legs on top of the bar. However, the senior did stick his dismount.</p>\n                <p>Simpson began his routine, falling the wrong way on his handstand, and then couldn\u2019t regroup in time to grab the bar on his Coleman, suffering a fall. He got back on the bar and finished his routine with a stick, but the damage was done as he scored an 11.200.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State welcomes Illinois to Rec Hall on Sunday, February 1, at 1 p.m. for its THON meet.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

And I think it's a group that, years down the years down the road, will stay connected.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions, regardless of graduation status, showed up to play on the special day. Backed by the supportive Roar Zone, <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/women_hockey/no-4-penn-state-women-s-hockey-utilizes-four-goal-first-period-in-series-sweep/article_1ff8895a-45e9-4859-bbc1-2ae4c40b41f7.html\" target=\"_blank\">Penn State posted a clean 7-0</a> scoreline to sweep the series over the Fightin\u2019 Blue Hens. With this victory, Penn State clinched the AHA Regular Season Championship, improving to 24-4 overall and 17-1 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>And it didn\u2019t take long for the senior class to get moving.</p>\n                <p>In the first period, Janecke tallied a pair of goals that sandwiched Lum\u2019s score. In her last series before heading overseas to play in the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games for Team USA, Janecke lasered a shot through three defenders off the post and into the back of the net 16 seconds into the game, assisted by Christian and Butze.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was really cool that we scored 15 seconds in with those six players on the ice,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThey've obviously had terrific careers, and that was a nice touch for Senior Day, and that got us going.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Lum scored three minutes later, picking up a bounce off the end boards on a shot by Danica Maynard. She ripped the puck into a wide-open net for her fourth goal of the season, increasing Penn State\u2019s lead to 2-0.</p>\n                <p>Janecke\u2019s second came from the same spot in the high slot for Penn State\u2019s third goal, assisted by Roberts, who sent the primary feed to Janecke.</p>\n                <p>The second period saw Butze and Vaslet linking up to assist on Nicole Hall\u2019s goal to further the gap to 6-0. Although she didn\u2019t score, Vaslet rang a shot off the iron on a breakaway. Janecke had a breakaway of her own, but she was dragged down before she was able to deke.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(The seniors) have been so helpful,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAll of them are so kind and helpful every day. They're an awesome group, and it's not going to be the same without them here next year.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Butze capped off the afternoon in the third period with Penn State\u2019s seventh unanswered goal, when she fired a wrist shot from the point that found an opening over goaltender Mattie Robitzer\u2019s shoulder. Butze\u2019s four-point game puts her at 23 points on the season and 84 in her career, which tied Lyndie Lobdell for Penn State\u2019s all-time assists by a defenseman.</p>\n                <p>DeSa made history as the final horn blared, as her 21st career shutout broke the program-record for all-time shutouts set by Josie Bothun in the 2023-24 season.</p>\n                <p>\u201c(DeSa) was behind Josie at that time, but she stayed the course and exceeded all expectations of her,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cShe did an amazing job again. Today wasn\u2019t the easiest game; she gets called in in different flurries for her to get called back to lock-in down the stretch.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After falling to Washington 81-65 on Wednesday, Penn State took a trip to Eugene to face Oregon. Both teams entered the game with a chance to break a losing streak: the 7-13 Lady Lions had dropped their last nine, and the Ducks lost their last four, entering at 14-7.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white couldn\u2019t build off its fast start, falling 89-59.</p>\n                <p>Penn State got the party started with a 7-0 scoring run, forcing Oregon coach Kelly Graves to burn a timeout less than two minutes into the game</p>\n                <p>Both teams went scoreless for two minutes after the break, until Sarah Rambus netted a layup for the Ducks\u2019 first points of the game.</p>\n                <p>After a three-pointer from Vit\u00f3ria Santana, the Lady Lions went cold as Oregon turned up the defensive pressure, but the Ducks kept quacking. Graves\u2019 squad went on an 8-0 run to tie the game up at 10 with three minutes to play in the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white ended its scoring drought with a layup from freshman guard Viktoria Ranisavljevic, but nonetheless, Oregon surged to take a 16-12 lead after the first quarter.</p>\n                <p>Both teams traded 5-0 scoring runs to start the second frame, but Avary Cain nailed back-to-back threes to give the Ducks a 28-19 lead heading into the first media timeout.</p>\n                <p>Oregon wasted no time coming out of the pause, with Katie Fiso charging the paint for two points. Fiso\u2019s attempt was quickly matched by T\u00e8a Cl\u00e8ante to put Penn State\u2019s deficit back to single digits.</p>\n                <p>Rambus and Kiyomi McMiller, each team's leading scorers for the game, seemed to be the only ones able to put the ball in the basket. That was until Ranisavljevic went on a 6-0 run by herself to cut the Ducks\u2019 lead to 38-34 with under a minute left in the quarter.</p>\n                <p>Ari Long nailed a two-point jumper with 30 seconds left, but the Lady Lions were unable to respond, giving Oregon a six-point lead heading into the locker room.</p>\n                <p>It was a sloppy first half, with both teams combining for 11 turnovers. With the absence of Gracie Merkle due to injury, the Ducks were able to net 20 points in the paint in the opening half, as opposed to the blue and white\u2019s 16.</p>\n                <p>Cl\u00e8ante got fouled to start the quarter, but only came away with one free throw. Ehis Etute answered with a quick two on the other end.</p>\n                <p>It was raining threes in Matthew Knight Arena for Oregon in the first portion of the third frame as the Ducks went three-for-three from beyond the arc right before a much-needed timeout was called by coach Carolyn Kieger.</p>\n                <p>Even with a timeout, the quarter remained all Oregon. The Ducks stormed for a 14-0 to take a 61-40 lead with just under four minutes to go in the frame. The run was ended with a two-pointer from McMiller, but momentum remained with the home team.</p>\n                <p>In a nearly flawless third quarter, Oregon outscored Penn State 34-11 to carry a 74-45 lead into the final frame. The Ducks shot 4-for-6 from three-point range and forced the Lady Lions to turn the ball over five times in the third.</p>\n                <p>After a quiet third quarter, McMiller netted the first points of the fourth for the blue and white with a layup. Fiso matched right away on the other end with a drive to the basket.</p>\n                <p>Even after McMillers\u2019 bucket, Penn State continued to struggle finding the hoop, missing four straight field goals and going on a two-minute scoring drought.</p>\n                <p>The drought ended when freshman Nyla McFadden was rewarded two points from the foul line. McFadden went on to score the next four points for the Lady Lions, but Oregon still held a comfortable 82-52 lead with just over five minutes to play.</p>\n                <p>As the clock fell just under two minutes, Kieger used her final timeout with the Ducks up 87-55. McFadden continued to show out in the fourth, with seven of her team-high 15 points coming in the frame.</p>\n                <p>The absence of Merkle was evident as points in the paint continued to plague Penn State. Oregon finished with 50 points from the inside and four Ducks scored in double figures.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>Amiya Evans remains listed as out for the Lady Lions. Leading scorer Gracie Merkle was also sidelined after suffering a head injury against Washington.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns home to host Minnesota at 6 p.m. Wednesday.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Due to the Saturday night arrival of winter storm Fern, No. 1 Penn State faced a quick turnaround to hit the road against Maryland.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions breezed through the Terrapins, moving faster than the wind in College Park, Maryland, en route to a 51-0 victory quick enough to beat the snow back to Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how it happened.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. Abram Cline (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl opened the match with wrist control for the first minute, leading to a takedown 60 seconds into the match. That was the only takedown Abram Cline let up in the first period, but Lilledahl took over in the second.</p>\n                <p>After keeping Cline down for over a minute, he secured two more takedowns before narrowly missing a pin as time expired on the second round.</p>\n                <p>Cline\u2019s defensive stance and Lilledahl\u2019s aggressive push led to two-stall calls against the Terrapin, and a match contested largely on the edge of the mat. Two more takedowns on the border and over two minutes of riding time secured the 19-4 tech fall for Lilledahl.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 5, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. No. 15 Braxton Brown (UMD)</p>\n                <p>The pair of 133-pounders spent a majority of the first round locked in a collar-and-elbow tie up, only breaking after a mad scramble that resulted in Marcus Blaze taking Braxton Brown down from the legs. The second period saw a similar scramble, where Brown attempted to push Blaze, only to have the momentum turned against him.</p>\n                <p>The third period saw Brown go defensive, allowing a takedown and a stall call to bring the match to major-decision territory for Blaze. The Nittany Lion was awarded on final takedown as the buzzer sounded while both men were in an apparent stalemate on the ground, extending the win to 15-3.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 9, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. Dario Lemus (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Much like Friday night, Braeden Davis was working at a faster pace than prior weeks as he took on Dario Lemus. He rushed Lemus and secured the first takedown one minute in. He landed a second takedown a minute later and rode out the frame trying to flip a prone Lemus.</p>\n                <p>After Lemus chose to start the second period on the bottom, Davis held onto him until his riding time crossed over a minute, then took him down again soon after the escape. Davis landed his fourth takedown after prying Lemus\u2019 hands off of his ankle with seconds to spare in the period.</p>\n                <p>Davis got another takedown with a minute remaining and worked on a near fall to secure a tech fall. He couldn\u2019t turn him, but secured a stalling point. However, Lemus escaped with seven seconds to ensure the bout ended as an 18-4 major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 13, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 7 Carter Young (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Carter Young was undefeated in dual matches entering Saturday and was Shayne Van Ness\u2019 toughest matchup of the season.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness started the aggression with an attack, but Young kept Van Ness staggered before reversing the takedown. He locked Van Ness into a cradle and received four-nearfall points before Van Ness escaped. After the first period, Young led Van Ness, 7-1.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness turned the tide in the second period, escaping and launching two quick takedowns to draw even. Two more takedowns in a matter of seconds had Van Ness up 14-10. He kept letting Young escape to launch more attacks. The Nittany Lion led 17-11 after Round 2.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness kept pushing Young down by the neck while on top in the third period, resulting in a stall call. Van Ness got two more takedowns before the clock passed 60 seconds remaining, entering major-decision territory. He finished off a tech fall with 30 seconds left, winning by an absurd score of 31-15.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 18, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Mekhi Neal (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mekhi Neal made the first minute difficult for PJ Duke, scampering away from multiple shot attempts and returned to his feet quickly after getting taken down. It only took Duke five seconds to take Neal down again.</p>\n                <p>One more quick takedown had Neal trapped in a cradle, and with a minute left in the first period, Duke was awarded the pin.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 24, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. AJ Rodrigues (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink took down AJ Rodrigues quickly, and racked up 11-near fall points and over two minutes of riding time before the first period ended. He led 14-0 but appeared upset that he didn\u2019t finish off the tech fall.</p>\n                <p>All he had to do was stand up in the second period to secure the 15-0 victory.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 29, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Seth Digby (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines was physically in control of Seth Digby throughout this bout, racking up riding time after two takedowns, and spent his time trying to cradle Digby. Haines only led 6-1 at the end of the first, but had two minutes of riding time under his name.</p>\n                <p>Haines got two more takedowns in Period 2, but Digby kept his center of gravity low to the mat, refusing to let Haines turn him for any back points.</p>\n                <p>Digby caught Haines by surprise to take him down at the start of Period 3, but Haines caught another gear after standing back up. Digby went on a defensive stand after that, unsuccessfully trying to keep Haines away from a tech fall. Haines crossed the 15-point threshold with 26 seconds remaining, winning 23-7.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 34, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. Sepanta Ahanj-Elias (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh followed the team trend of landing the first takedown right around the one-minute mark. His second score came via a double-leg slam that thumped Sepanta Ahnaj-Elias down to the mat for the rest of the period.</p>\n                <p>The second period opened with Welsh on the bottom, but he stood up and quickly pinned Ahanj-Elias before the frame reached its midpoint.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 40, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 13 Branson John (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Branson John used his height advantage to fend off Josh Barr for most of the first period, but after John mistimed an attack, Barr seized his leg and landed the first takedown.</p>\n                <p>He got one more takedown in the second period, then picked the ankle once more in the third, and quickly flipped John but over-spun to just miss the pin. Two more takedowns handed Barr the 19-4 victory and Penn State another tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 45, Maryland 0</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Joey Schneck (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Mirasola got his next takedown one minute into Round 2 and impressively locked a standing cradle on Schneck, dropping him for the pin.</p>\n                <p>Penn State 51, Maryland 0</p>",

Burkhart threw for 20.26m, followed by Sam Engebretson\u2019s 19.32m throw for second place.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s success continued in the men\u2019s 3000-meter as senior Logan Strawser led the way with a personal best 8:08.84.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s 60-meter dash, freshman Lucas Band was the only competitor for the Nittany Lions. However, he earned a personal best 6.90 and qualified for the finals in eighth place, followed by another personal best 6.87 for seventh place in the finals.</p>\n                <p>Sophomore Alexandria North continued her success from last weekend in the 400 meters, as she finished fifth with a time of 54.92.</p>\n                <p>In the men\u2019s pole vault, senior Tristan McGarrah neared his season best with a second-place finish with 2.04 meters.</p>\n                <p>While junior Lizzie Schreiber didn\u2019t compete in the long jump, she came back and won the men\u2019s triple jump with a meet-record jump of 12.69m.</p>\n                <p>The women\u2019s shot put saw a pair of personal bests come from Penn State\u2019s two competitors, as sophomore Skye Petrie-Cameron finished third with a throw of 15.58m. Fellow sophomore Sasha Garnett threw 14.97 for fourth place.</p>\n                <p>After Strawser won the 3000m earlier in the day, junior Nick Sloff competed in the elite men\u2019s 3000m, where he broke the school record. Sloff won the race in 7:48.56, breaking the Penn State record by nearly two seconds.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions\u2019 success continued into the men\u2019s 200m, where Ajani Dwyer won his first 200m of the season with a personal best and No. 2 time in Penn State history of 20.52 \u2014 the current top mark in the NCAA.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wrapped up the action on the field with the men\u2019s shot put, where Brady Mider and Sam Engebretson finished second and third.

    "description": "<p>After suffering a 3-0 sweep to McKendree last night, Penn State got another look at the Bearcats today, hoping to avoid a second-straight loss.</p>\n                <p>It was much of the same on Saturday, though, as the Nittany Lions fell to McKendree 3-1 for a series sweep.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was first on the board after a Miller Trubey service ace opened the scoring. The Nittany Lions went on a 4-0 scoring run until a Miller error got the Bearcats back into it.</p>\n                <p>After trading points back-and-forth, Penn State found itself down 19-14 after a Tyler Tripp kill put McKendree in a prime position to win the first set.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions kept it interesting, but a Bryce Wetjen kill solidified it as the Bearcats captured the first set.</p>\n                <p>It couldn\u2019t have been more different in the early running of the second set, though, as Penn State jumped ahead to an early 8-3 lead. Most of the points came from errors, though Miller, Gabriel Gaige and Sean Harvey recorded kills.</p>\n                <p>A 3-0 Bearcat scoring run forced Mark Pavlik and the Nittany Lions into a timeout, holding a 17-12 advantage.</p>\n                <p>McKendree stuck around, going on another 3-0 scoring run, but Penn State stole the second set, winning 25-19 with the help of another Miller kill.</p>\n                <p>With the match now tied at 1-1, the third set proved to be the tightest of the lot in the early bits with points being traded back and forth, but back-to-back Rolen Lively kills gave the Bearcats a 7-5 lead.</p>\n                <p>The action remained tight, with Penn State fighting for a score, cutting into McKendree\u2019s lead with another Harvey kill that made the blue and white\u2019s deficit just two points.</p>\n                <p>Back-to-back kills tied it up for the Nittany Lions at 17 apiece, but the Bearcats just kept putting it together, going on another scoring run to command a 21-18 lead.</p>\n                <p>With the end of the third set in sight, Tripp picked up his 11th kill of the day, which helped McKendree capture the third set 25-22.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was closing in right at the end of the set, with Harvey and Trubey picking up their eighth and ninth kills, but it just wasn\u2019t enough, and the blue and white moved one set closer to a loss.</p>\n                <p>Now closer to suffering a series sweep, the Nittany Lions once again started off the scoring first, and Owen Rose matched a McKendree service ace with one of his own as the third set got off to a flying start.</p>\n                <p>Another Harvey kill, and a Tripp error on the attack made it a 6-5 advantage for the blue and white. Penn State temporarily held a two-point lead, but the play was overturned and ruled a Lively kill, tying it up for the Bearcats at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>A controversial score ruling gave McKendree a 15-11 lead, as the Bearcats were slowly pulling away and getting closer to sweeping the Nittany Lions. Rattled, Penn State used another timeout after a Harvey error.</p>\n                <p>The Bearcats, now putting the hurt on the blue and white, took a 19-15 lead, forcing another Pavlik timeout after a Gaige error.</p>\n                <p>Penn State was drawing dead but stayed alive with a Jaidyn Bethel kill effort, which was matched with another from Harvey and one from freshman Tristan Hassell, who recorded 13 kills against Lewis a week ago.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions closed the gap and worked their deficit down to 21-20 after a Jack Morikawa service error silenced the Bearcat end of the floor.</p>\n                <p>Action was tied up at 24-24, but a Lively kill put McKendree back up in front as the game was coming to a head.</p>\n                <p>The Bearcats kept scoring but Penn State was resilient and not letting things end so easily. The blue and white effort was all for nothing, though, as a Sam Hoskin kill sealed the deal, winning the fourth and final set 28-26 for McKendree.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action this Friday to host No. 3 Hawaii at Rec Hall in the whiteout game.</p>\n                <p>Friday\u2019s match is scheduled for 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State returned to Pegula Ice Arena for its first home series since November. In a successful welcome back party, the Nittany Lions blanked Delaware 5-0 in Game 1 of the series. This game also marked the first game of senior weekend as eight students were honored throughout the series.</p>\n                <p>A four-goal first period quickly gave the Nittany Lions momentum that they didn\u2019t lose the entire game, leading to a 7-0 win.</p>\n                <p>Coach Jeff Kampersal spoke briefly on the \u201cslow start\u201d following the 5-0 win. Kampersal alluded to the seven games on the road before returning to Pegula. However, the Nittany Lions didn\u2019t take long to get on the board in Game 2 as Tessa Janecke found the net only 16 seconds into the game.</p>\n                <p>The Orangeville, Illinois, native quickly made her way into the offensive zone and ripped a wrist shot through two defensemen. An all-around gritty effort from the senior on senior day.</p>\n                <p>Janecke, along with Nicole Hall, played their last regular season series as they departed for the Olympics.</p>\n                <p>The early scoring didn\u2019t stop there as Danica Maynard took the puck off the faceoff and shot a pass that bounced off the end boards and right onto Taylor Lum\u2019s stick. Lum didn\u2019t hesitate to bury the puck into the wide-open net.</p>\n                <p>This was Lum\u2019s fourth goal of the season and a senior\u2019s second of the game.</p>\n                <p>Abby Stonehouse had a perfect chance to add to the 2-0 lead as she was all alone with the goalie at the top of the crease. However, Mattie Robitzer decided this was a great time to flash the leather as she robbed Stonehouse with her glove.</p>\n                <p>Janecke wasn\u2019t finished in the opening period as Penn State was on the power play. The senior took advantage after a wrist shot from the high slot quickly found the net.</p>\n                <p>Stonehouse quickly followed suit as she intercepted a shot in front of the net from Katelyn Roberts. The Blenheim, Ontario, native went from her forehand to backhand and beat Robitzer.</p>\n                <p>Although Penn State found success in the goal department, the opening period came to a close with it on the penalty kill.</p>\n                <p>Second-line magic opened the second period for Penn State. Mikah Keller sent a pass to Grace Outer from below the red line. Outwater took quick work of the puck as she found an opening in the top-right corner.</p>\n                <p>Nicole Hall then joined Janecke as olympians to score in this game as she sent a wrist shot from the high slot that was zipped by Robitzer.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions spent the majority of the second period in its offensive zone, however they were caught being too aggressive at times. Both Janecke and Hall spent time in the penalty box for being a little too aggressive on the boards. The penalty kill for Penn State took this middle frame to shine as it killed both penalties.</p>\n                <p>The third period saw a slower tempo in its first 10 minutes as both teams had opportunities to add to the scoreboard. That was until Kendall Butze sent a slapshot from the point that found the back of the net.</p>\n                <p>Tempers began to flare after a heavy hit was laid on Outwater at center ice. The Picton, Ontario, native didn\u2019t take too kindly to the hit and laid a return bodycheck post-whistle. Ultimately leading to four-four with two minutes to go.</p>\n                <p>No additions to the scoreboard were made after the late-game scuffle as Penn State swept the Blue Hens after back-to-back shutouts.</p>\n                <p>With this shutout, Katie Desa now holds the record for all-time shutouts in Penn State history.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State makes its way across the street for an outdoor game at Beaver Stadium against Robert Morris on Jan. 30 at 1 p.m. The Nittany Lions then return to Pegula Ice Arena for Game 2 on Jan. 31 at 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>With a winter storm warning ahead, Penn State brought a storm of its own to Rec Hall Saturday with its highest score this season.</p>\n                <p>Putting up an elite-level day, the Nittany Lions beat Maryland 197.250-196.675.</p>\n                <p>Rotation One</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions managed a big 49.150 on vault to open the meet, courtesy of senior Ava Piedrahita\u2019s massive 9.900 in the anchor position on her unique half on, pike off.</p>\n                <p>Elizabeth Leary got the rotation off on the right foot with a stuck Yurchenko full for a 9.825. Allison Kaempfer was another standout in the rotation, scoring a career-high 9.850 on her Yuchenko 1.5, no longer struggling with under rotation.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Ava Cash got her chance, scoring a solid 9.800 on her Yurchenko full with a hop back. Jessica Johanson and Dani Latronica each struggled a bit, dipping below the 9.800 mark with a 9.725 and 9.775, with some hops on the landings.</p>\n                <p>However, with Johanson\u2019s score dropping, the blue and white took an early, but small .075 lead.</p>\n                <p>On the bars, Maryland was solid, only counting one score below the 9.800-plus range. The highlight of the rotation was Aine Reade\u2019s 9.850; however, without a big 9.900, the Terps had some catching up to do.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Two</p>\n                <p>Penn State gave the fans in Rec Hall a show to watch on the bars, scoring a huge 49.450 to extend its lead over Maryland to 98.600-98.050 at the halfway point.</p>\n                <p>Ellie Monahan opened the rotation off with 9.850. She nailed her handstands throughout and stuck her full twisting double back dismount to get the team started. Johanson was short on her pirouette handstand on the low bar and took a hop back on her double layout, scoring a 9.800.</p>\n                <p>In the third slot, Leary got the scores rising again. Nailing her release sequence and sticking her double back dismount, she managed a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>Cash followed her with another 9.875. She got a beautiful height on her piked jaegar. She was short on her final handstand, but as the sticky feet were contagious, she nailed her dismount as well.</p>\n                <p>Piedrahita tied her own score from the vault with another 9.900 and a stuck landing, paving the way for the event-winner Latronica.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore anchor put up a massive 9.950 in the anchor position. Her piked jaeger was massive, and she hit her overshoot to handstand right on top of the bar. Keeping up with her teammates, she stuck her landing.</p>\n                <p>On the vault, Maryland could not keep up with Penn State\u2019s pace. The Terrapins managed only one vault better than a 9.800 courtesy of Taylor Rech\u2019s 9.850. Maryland opened the door for Penn State to extend its lead and the Nittany Lions did just that.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Three</p>\n                <p>Penn State was unable to keep the same momentum on bars, but put together a solid rotation on beam with a 49.175. Monahan kicked things off with a huge routine. Nailing her front-toss combination and sticking her 1.5 dismount for a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Alyssa Kramer kept the steady performance going with her back handspring back layout acro series and another stuck dismount to improve on her two previous 9.775s with a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Ashley Maul began the string of triple acro series off with a bang. She was slightly underrotated on her dismount, having to take a hop in the wrong direction, which dipped her score to a 9.775</p>\n                <p>Kalea McElligott got the scores back on track with a 9.825 courtesy of her triple series, followed by a stuck dismount.</p>\n                <p>Leary had a big wobble on her series. She took a small hop on her dismount as well, finishing off a shaky routine with a low 9.675.</p>\n                <p>Latronica, with pressure to drop the 9.75, ended the rotation on a high note. Nailing her series and difficult leaps, the sophomore stuck her gainer full to bounce back with a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>On the floor, Maryland got its momentum back in a huge way. Madeline Komoroski and Reade both had an event-winning 9.975, meaning one judge gave them each a perfect 10.0. That massive score alongside a few other 9.900s helped Maryland put up a 49.575 on the event to cut Penn State\u2019s lead down to 147.775-147.625.</p>\n                <p>Rotation Four</p>\n                <p>With the Terrapins on their heels, the Nittany Lions managed to score a 49.475 on the floor to keep them at bay.</p>\n                <p>Maul, the usual leadoff, brought big energy to open the rotation with a solid two passes, including a strong double back for a 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Monahan had too much momentum on her front double full, not fully controlling her lunge forward. She reeled in the power on her second pass for a matching 9.850.</p>\n                <p>Bella Misiura opened her only routine of the day with another front double full and a really controlled landing on her second pass to begin building the scores with a 9.900.</p>\n                <p>Johanson struggled on her double pike, landing a bit straight-legged for a pogo-stick-type hop but cleaned up the landing on her second pass for a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>Not to be outdone, Kramer showcased control on both of her passes to manage a 9.975 of her own to a co-champion of the event alongside Komoroski and Reade.</p>\n                <p>Having already clinched the win, McElligott only widened Penn State\u2019s victory. Her 9.900 capped off an incredible day for the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Maryland was solid on the beam, but with no massive 9.900+ scores, the Terrapins were unable to carry their momentum into a win.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>After shutting out Indiana inside of Rec Hall on Friday, No. 1 Penn State faces a quick turnaround to College Park, Maryland, for a Saturday evening showdown with the No. 29 Terrapins.</p>\n                <p>The dual was originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon, but due to the impending arrival of Winter Storm Fern, the contest at the Schanwald Center was moved to 5 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>As a result of the rescheduling, the broadcast has been moved from Big Ten Network to Big Ten Plus, which is free to watch all weekend throughout the snowstorm.</p>\n                <p>Maryland is a similar opponent to Indiana in that it\u2019s a lower-tier Big Ten opponent that a Penn State lineup, featuring six No. 1 wrestlers, should be expected to cruise through in time to beat the snow back to State College.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. Presden Sanchez (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Both Luke Lilledahl and Presden Sanchez are coming off matches with Indiana\u2019s Jacob Moran. Sanchez suffered a tech fall in his bout, while Lilledahl secured a pin.</p>\n                <p>Sanchez is 0-4 in his redshirt freshman campaign while Lilledahl doesn\u2019t have an official loss on his record this season.

Blaze is arguably the best competition he\u2019s faced this season.</p>\n                <p>Blaze is looking to continue his perfect season against Brown. The freshman is 3-0 with two-bonus point matches against opponents ranked higher than Brown this season.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. Dario Lemus (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Similarly to Brown, Dario Lemus has yet to defeat a top-16 opponent this season. Lemus is 12-7 and is on pace for his first year wrestling attached with a record above .500.</p>\n                <p>However, Braeden Davis has been improving rapidly since returning to the lineup for Penn State and scored 24 points in a victory on Friday. Davis should control the pace in this match.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. No. 7 Carter Young (UMD)</p>\n                <p>The highest ranked match of the dual comes at 149 pounds between Shayne Van Ness and Carter Young. This is the only top-10 match on the card.</p>\n                <p>Young transferred into Maryland from Oklahoma State after going 10-10 in his first season under head coach David Taylor. He has upped his output to an 8-1 record in 2025-26.</p>\n                <p>Young has also beat both top-16 competitors he\u2019s faced and now tests himself against the top-ranked athlete in the weight class.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness is undefeated on the season, but Young is a higher level of competition than he has faced. Van Ness\u2019 pace can be matched by Young, so expect a lower-scoring match than Van Ness is accustomed to.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Michael Pizzuto (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Michael Pizzuto is a redshirt sophomore with multiple accolades off the mat, including academic all-Big Ten honors. However, on the mat, Pizzuto is .500 in his collegiate career and hasn\u2019t shown the ability to compete with world-class opponents.</p>\n                <p>Duke is just that, especially after receiving his World Championship ring on Friday from USA wrestling after competing in the U20 World Championship event this past summer. His last two matches have ended prior to the third round and that trend should continue against Maryland.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. AJ Rodriguez (UMD)</p>\n                <p>What more needs to be said about Mitchell Mesenbrink other than he is a bonus-point machine. He secured a pin on Friday night and will look to match that effort Saturday.</p>\n                <p>AJ Rodriguez is another Terrapin whose record is floating narrowly above an even showing and has yet to face a top-20 opponent. Mesenbrink will be an evening wake up call for Rodriguez.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Seth Digby (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Continuing up Penn state\u2019s murderers row is another mismatch for U23 World Champion Levi Haines. Haines hasn\u2019t lost since last season\u2019s NCAA finals, and 2-7 freshman Seth Digby isn\u2019t likely to break that trend.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. Sepanta Ahanj-Elias (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Another freshman for the Terrapins, Sepanta Ahanj-Elias bounces between 184 and 197 for Maryland. Going up against the No. 1 in a weight class that involves a heavy cut is a bad sign for the red singlet.</p>\n                <p>Ahnaj-Elias is coming off of a major-decision loss to Sam Goin, who Rocco Welsh defeated on Friday. Welsh should have an easy Saturday retaining his No. 1 spot.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 13 Branson John (UMD)</p>\n                <p>This match features more intrigue than expected at the start of the year, as Branson John has become Maryland\u2019s most improved competitor this season.</p>\n                <p>After scratching into the NCAA tournament last season, John is firmly in contention with a 19-3 record. While he doesn\u2019t have any major victories on his record, he has won via bonus points in half of his matches this year.</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr immediately regained his No. 1 ranking since returning and has been churning ever since. He\u2019s seen close matchups as of late and this has the makings of another tense affair.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Joey Schneck (UMD)</p>\n                <p>Closing out the dual will be Cole Mirasola against Joey Schneck. So far, every time Mirasola faces an unranked opponent, he completes the job in the blink of an eye. Schneck fits that mold perfectly at 5-5.</p>\n                <p>Mirasola shouldn\u2019t struggle against Schneck.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Braeden Davis is a man of few words when it comes to speaking into a microphone \u2014 Davis prefers to do his talking on the mat.</p>\n                <p>He did just that in Penn State\u2019s dual against Indiana Friday, dropping 24 points in a major-decision victory over No. 25 Henry Porter. The Hoosier scored 10 points against Davis, keeping him one point shy of a tech-fall finish, but Davis didn\u2019t let the takedown shake his focus on the mat.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been taught that if something goes bad, just go and score another takedown,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t get thrown on my back.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While Porter offered Davis a modicum of adversity, it was not a worry compared to the treacherous path the junior has walked this season. He\u2019s the only Nittany Lion to have taken a loss in their last six dual matches.</p>\n                <p>That loss came to Iowa\u2019s Nasir Bailey, a loss decided by one point, and in which Davis was seconds away from earning that point via riding time or stalling calls.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a fine line between winning and losing,\u201d Cael Sanderson said on Tuesday. \u201c(Davis) will just keep getting better as we move forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Davis walked to the mat Friday, his new walkout song, \u201cBawitadaba\u201d by Kid Rock, didn\u2019t become audible until the final seconds before his match began, a fitting metaphor for a late-onset season for the defending All-American.</p>\n                <p>At the start of Penn State\u2019s season, Davis was notified he\u2019d be redshirting. Following an offseason that saw Davis mired in <a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/news/crime_courts/penn-state-wrestler-faces-criminal-charges-after-incident-outside-tau-kappa-epsilon/article_86091be1-8f50-4aff-86fd-63d4b242353c.html\" target=\"_blank\">off-mat controversy,</a> the additions of Marcus Blaze, Masanosuke Ono and the return of Aaron Nagao, Davis was the odd man out of the lineup.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere was a little bit of confusion at the start of the year but it feels good.\u201d Davis said about returning to the lineup.</p>\n                <p>Davis admittedly didn\u2019t manage his weight with intention during the month-long period where he wasn\u2019t expecting to compete. He only competed at the Kauffman Open in January to start the year. The Belleville, Michigan, native went 4-0 to win the tournament.</p>\n                <p>That week, Davis learned he would burn his expected redshirt after Nagao once again suffered a season-ending injury. Then the work started to get back into starting lineup worthy condition.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAt the time, I thought I was redshirting, so what do you expect?\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo no, I definitely didn\u2019t (manage weight) the best.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson didn't hesitate to give his trusted lightweight the opportunity to hold his spot knowing that Nagao wasn\u2019t likely to return this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe kinda just threw him right in there and that decision is made as he\u2019s a competitor,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cHe will just keep rolling with things.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Getting in shape was easier for Davis than in past years as he moved closer to his natural weight. As a freshman, Davis wrestled down weight at 125 pounds, then bumped up to 133 pounds last season. Weight management is easier for the junior as he bumps up again into the 141-pound slot.</p>\n                <p>Davis\u2019 pace has continued to improve as he works his way deeper into the season, peaking Friday with an eight-takedown performance against Porter. Rec Hall gave Davis a resounding ovation as he left the mat for his largest win of the season. The moment represented Davis finding his place back in Penn State\u2019s starting lineup and finding his comfort in a fluctuating season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a little bit of a challenge at first, but now that I\u2019m down to my normal shape, it\u2019s quite comfortable.\u201d Davis said. \u201c(141-pounds) is probably the most comfortable out of all the weight classes I\u2019ve wrestled so far.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

After Braeden Davis\u2019 commanding 24-10 victory by major decision, he was greeted by Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics Pat Kraft, who gave him an emphatic high five with his left hand.</p>\n                <p>It was a commanding 48-0 win for Penn State over Indiana to make it 81 straight wins in dual matches, but for Cael Sanderson\u2019s squad, it was another day in the office.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe enjoy competing, and each individual's working on what they do and getting better in each match,\u201d Cael Sanderson said. \u201cEvery time you step out there, it's an opportunity to compete and do something you love, and then also continue to get better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>At intermission, Penn State had eight of its nine wrestlers receive championship rings from suiting up for Team USA this past summer in the U23 and U20 World Championships. Mesenbrink was the lone Nittany Lion who didn\u2019t partake in the ceremony, as his bout was up next coming out of the half.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson often preaches how the goal for his wrestlers is to succeed beyond the collegiate stage. The success at the international level this past summer proved just that.</p>\n                <p>But then it again, it carries over to when his wrestlers suit up in the blue and white singlets. Entering the weekend Penn State had six guys ranked No. 1 in the InterMat rankings, but those top spots don\u2019t really matter to Sanderson.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think we have a strong team, obviously, a lot of good kids,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cWe don't really focus or worry or think too much about rankings, right? It's the same boring process of getting better every day and every competition and remain grateful for the opportunities that we have, and all those other things will take care of themselves.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With the win over the Hoosiers, Penn State moved to 10-0 on the year and 4-0 in Big Ten play. It was a dominant showing in front of a Rec Hall crowd that had over 6,200 people show up draped head to toe in the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson said Indiana was \u201cscrappy.\u201d The No. 25 Hoosiers ended up recording more takedowns than what No. 4 Iowa recorded against the Nittany Lions a week ago, but Penn State still ended up with bonus points in nine of the 10 victories.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThey came out fighting, so it was good for us, and it's good that our guys were able to score a lot of points,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cI think when you enjoy what you're doing, points are obviously a good thing, and it's good training and conditioning.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to action on Saturday to face Maryland in College Park, as pending snowstorms had the dual moved from Sunday. Sanderson said wrestling in consecutive days will be great preparation for the postseason, where the wrestlers will have to do just that.</p>\n                <p>After blowing out Indiana, the Nittany Lions will face a similar caliber opponent in the Terrapins. Despite blowing out the Hoosiers, and the outcome likely to be very similar against Maryland, Sanderson is expecting his squad to fine-tune mistakes from Friday as it hits the road.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s to be expected from a coach who has led Penn State to 12 national titles as a head coach, because finding miscues in a 48-0 victory is what it takes to create a dynasty like he has.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe weren't at our best at every weight, but we're excited to keep pushing forward here and get right back on the mat,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>",

    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State hasn\u2019t played a home series since November of last year. What happened in that game, you may ask? Second line dominance from the three forwards: Maddy Christian, Mikah Keller and Grace Outwater.</p>\n                <p>In their return to Pegula Ice Arena, the forwards continued to shine as three of the five goals for the Nittany Lions came from the second line. The three forwards scored a goal apiece while racking up their points through assists. Ultimately, the line as a whole produced six total points in a 5-0 conference victory over Delaware</p>\n                <p>What makes a line continue production like they have, falls on the players doing their respective parts on a continuous basis. This is seen nearly every shift, especially from their coach, Jeff Kampersal.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMaddy (Christian) has speed and the same skill, Mikah (Keller) has the vision, Grace (Outwater) scores goals and you don\u2019t have to tell her twice to shoot,\u201d Kampersal said. \u201cThey are going to carry the load moving forward for sure.\u201d</p>\n                <p>As Kampersal describes how each player contributes to a talented forward trio, it paints the picture of a three-headed monster. A unit's defensemen don\u2019t want to see skating down the ice on a forecheck.</p>\n                <p>The three have been grouped together for nearly the whole season. Due to this, their chemistry has evolved into bonds never forgotten. As seniors soon depart, such as Christian, forming a bond with her teammates gives her the utmost gratitude as she is more than halfway done with her season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cAs a senior, knowing that I have this group, I love it because I know I feel like we all just chem together,\u201d Christian said. \u201cWe all have our different attributes that make us great, and it\u2019s heartwarming to know that I\u2019m there for Mikah and Mikah is there for Grace.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The idea of all three forwards being there for each other was portrayed in a two-on-one opportunity for Outwater and Christian in the game against the Blue Hens. As Outwater received a pass from Leah Stecker from the other end of the ice, it was up to the Picton, Ontario, native to shoot the puck herself or feed a pass to her linemate for the fourth goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>With both possibilities playing in her mind, the forward dished the puck across the crease for a wrist shot from Christian that gave the Nittany Lions a 4-0 lead late in the second period. As testament to the trio being there for each other, Outwater revealed her mindset as she got closer to the net.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat was the perfect opportunity to shoot, and then last second I saw Maddy, and I was like \u2018oh my gosh, pass it,\u2019\u201d Outwater said. \u201cShe got it, and it was a really good goal. So, it was nice.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Greg Finberg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky cited his team\u2019s fast starts as a key to its five-game winning streak. His group had scored first in four of its last five games.</p>\n                <p>The No. 8 Nittany Lions\u2019 start to Friday\u2019s contest at the Kohl Center was anything but fast after three first-period penalties put them in an early hole. But behind a pair of hat tricks from Dane Dowiak and Gavin McKenna, plus 39 saves from Josh Fleming, Penn State scored seven unanswered goals to stun No. 5 Wisconsin, 7-2.</p>\n                <p>The comeback victory marked the longest Big Ten winning streak in program history, according to the Big Ten Plus broadcast.</p>\n                <p>Alex Servagno started the game in the penalty box after Penn State\u2019s warm-up infraction. And after Nolan Collins played a puck with a broken stick, the Nittany Lions were down two men just one minute into the period.</p>\n                <p>Enter Fleming, a 2026 Hobey Baker Award nominee, who denied two point-blank chances to keep the game scoreless.</p>\n                <p>Shea Van Olm, who returned from a four-game absence, checked a Wisconsin forward from behind and into the boards. The freshman forward was handed a five-minute major and a game misconduct, which ended his return after just 10 minutes.</p>\n                <p>And while Fleming\u2019s heroism held the Badgers scoreless on their first power play, his first blunder awaited on the ensuing penalty kill. The freshman goaltender denied Tyson Dyck\u2019s initial shot but failed to corral the rebound, which Dyck tapped home for a 1-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>Oliver Tulk later sniped a shot past Fleming\u2019s blocker to make it two Wisconsin tallies on its lengthy power play. The Badgers led 18-4 in shots and held a 2-0 advantage at the first intermission \u2014 a lead that could\u2019ve been extended if not for Fleming\u2019s 16 saves.</p>\n                <p>Fleming\u2019s resolve was rewarded two minutes into the second period when Mac Gadowsky backhanded a slot feed to Dowiak, who snapped it top shelf to cut Penn State\u2019s deficit in half. It was a one-score game despite Wisconsin\u2019s 22-7 shots advantage.</p>\n                <p>Following interference and cross-checking calls on the Badgers, it was Penn State\u2019s turn on the 5-on-3. And like its opponent, the Nittany Lions struck twice.</p>\n                <p>McKenna struck first when he skated patiently into the slot before rifling a wrist shot through traffic for his seventh goal of the season. Dowiak followed with a rebound tally, his second goal of the contest, to give Penn State a 3-2 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Shots were 18-18 in the second period. The difference: Fleming stopped all 18 to give himself 34 saves entering the final period.</p>\n                <p>After an abysmal start, the Nittany Lions had silenced the Kohl Center crowd, which went from quiet to stunned when Jackson Smith scored 15 seconds into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Standing near the blue line, the heavy-hitting defenseman threw a wrist shot on goal, hoping to get a deflection and nothing more. But the traffic blocked Daniel Hauser\u2019s vision, and Smith\u2019s shot hit the net to give Penn State a 4-2 lead.</p>\n                <p>Smith\u2019s tally provided some insurance, but McKenna wasn\u2019t satisfied. At the halfway point of the period, Penn State\u2019s No. 72 again skated patiently into the offensive zone, this time wristing a shot far side and beyond Hauser\u2019s outstretched blocker for his second goal of the game.</p>\n                <p>Dowiak seemingly took exception to McKenna matching his goal total and raised him one better when he poked a loose puck between Hauser\u2019s five-hole to complete his hat trick. Fleming\u2019s acrobatic pad save to spark Dowiak\u2019s shorthanded tally was a fitting close to a dominant final two periods for the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>McKenna added a late tally to complete his first collegiate hat trick, as the Nittany Lions improved to 17-6 and extended their winning streak to six games.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State returned to Rec Hall after a two-dual weekend in the Midwest. The Nittany Lions hosted No. 25 Indiana in the historic venue as part of another two-dual weekend.</p>\n                <p>It was all Penn State from the start, as the Nittany Lions took down the Hoosiers, 48-0, winning nine of the ten matches by bonus points.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how each matchup went down.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 12 Jacob Moran (IU)</p>\n                <p>The last time the two wrestlers met was on Nov. 5, 2022, where Jacob Moran came out on top with a 6-5 decision at the Black Knight Invitational.</p>\n                <p>This time, Luke Lilledahl got the best of Moran, as after multiple takedowns, the Nittany Lion managed to put Moran on his back. Lilledahl got the four swipes from the official, and put both shoulders down for the pinfall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State began with a 6-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. Blaine Frazier (IU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze went on the attack early and often against the unranked Blaine Frazier, leading the match 9-2 after the opening frame.</p>\n                <p>Blaze held over a minute of riding time and added onto it in the second period with two additional takedowns. One final takedown was all Blaze needed to end the match, earning the tech fall at the 5:44 mark.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s lead extended to 11-0.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 25 Henry Porter (IU)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis gave up the first takedown of the match, but quickly responded with a takedown of his own to overtake the lead with a 4-3 score just over a minute into the match.</p>\n                <p>Davis continued his aggression after another takedown to lead 7-5 after the first period. The Belleville, Michigan, native proved his ability to ride on top, putting up over two minutes of riding time after the second period.</p>\n                <p>With a 22-9 lead, and just nine seconds remaining, Davis opted for neutral positioning in a tech-fall attempt. Despite not getting the takedown, Porter received another stalling warning, awarding Davis another point. With over three minutes of riding time, Davis secured another point, winning by major decision, 24-10.</p>\n                <p>Davis\u2019 major decision put Penn State up 15-0.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. Joey Buttler (IU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness consistently pushed for a fall in his match against Joey Buttler. Van Ness\u2019 two takedowns and four-nearfall points gave him a 10-1 lead after one period.</p>\n                <p>After an escape point for Buttler in the second period, Van Ness went back on the attack in the third. A takedown with 15 seconds remaining ended the match, giving the Nittany Lion a tech-fall win.</p>\n                <p>Van Ness\u2019 tech fall at 6:45 put Penn State up 20-0.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Bryce Lowery (IU)</p>\n                <p>Keeping up with the aggressive mindset, PJ Duke notched his first takedown within seconds of the match beginning. A highly offensive first period saw Duke earn six takedowns en route to an 18-5 lead with 1:36 of riding time.</p>\n                <p>A seventh takedown 16 seconds into the second period ended things, as Duke won 21-5 by tech fall.</p>\n                <p>Penn State entered the intermission with a 25-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 19 Tyler Lillard (IU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink continued to show emphasis on back points and fall attempts. Against Tyler Lillard, Mesenbrink tried not once, not twice, but three times to get the fall over Lillard.</p>\n                <p>The third time was the charm, as Mesenbrink would\u2019ve had the tech fall, but instead got both shoulders on the ground for the fall at 4:01.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s rout continued with a 31-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. Orlando Cruz (IU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines showcased why he\u2019s the top wrestler at 174 pounds once again. In his match against Orlando Cruz, Haines led 7-0 with a takedown and four-nearfall points after the opening period.</p>\n                <p>He continued on the offensive, leading 11-0 after two periods and finished things off with two takedowns in the third period. A tech fall at 6:26 ended the match early with another bonus-point win.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions led 36-0.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 15 Sam Goin (IU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh put together another aggressive and offensive performance in his match against Sam Goin.</p>\n                <p>Welsh held a 10-2 lead after the first period before extending it in the second with a takedown. Despite the big lead, Welsh conceded a takedown, closing the gap slightly. Goin added a second takedown as time was ticking down, giving him an opportunity to win.</p>\n                <p>Goin\u2019s attempt at nearfall points was unsuccessful and Welsh held on to the victory with a 15-9 decision. It was the first non-bonus point victory for the Nittany Lions in the dual.</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s lead pushed to 39-0.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 14 Gabe Sollars (IU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr secured his first takedown in the first minute after a scramble allowed him to get behind Gabe Sollars.</p>\n                <p>Holding a 3-1 lead, Barr extended it to 7-2 in the second period before extending it even more in the third. Despite multiple caution calls prior to the match resuming and a stalling call against Barr that left Rec Hall unhappy, Barr came out on top, winning the match 14-6 by major decision.</p>\n                <p>Penn State led 43-0 with just one match remaining.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Caleb Marzolino (IU)</p>\n                <p>Cole Mirasola faced a similar sized wrestler in Caleb Marzolino. In the match, Mirasola secured takedown after takedown in the first period, proving his aggression.</p>\n                <p>Seven takedowns in the opening period forced Marzolino to get up, which ended things early. A tech fall at the 2:46 mark ended the dual with another Penn State shutout.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions by a 48-0 score, dominating each match.</p>",

    "description": "<p>No. 10 Penn State took its first loss of the season against No. 15 McKendree in a 3-0 sweep from the Melvin Price Convocation Center in Lebanon, Illinois.</p>\n                <p>The first set started with a few back-and-forth points, several of which resulted from service errors on both ends of the court. Penn State had a rocky start, but an Owen Rose service ace tied the score at 9-9.</p>\n                <p>While McKendree was able to score quick back-to-back points to take a brief lead, a huge block from Gaige Gabriel brought the blue and white back into it. After a few quick points, it was tied at 13-13.</p>\n                <p>The first set continued going back and forth between the remaining few points. Two back-to-back kills from Sean Harvey kept the Nittany Lions neck-and-neck with the Bearcats.</p>\n                <p>At 17-17, a Penn State service error and a huge kill from the opposition gave McKendree a two-point lead. But, a critical kill from Gabriel put the score at 19-18, giving the blue and white a fighting chance with the end of the set approaching.</p>\n                <p>Two attack errors from the blue and white put McKendree up 21-18, forcing the blue and white to take a timeout and regroup. However, another kill from the Bearcats added another point to their lead.</p>\n                <p>With another crucial kill from Gabriel, the blue and white brought out the 7-foot Miller Trubey for a serve, which resulted in another point for Penn State after a Carter Dittman kill.</p>\n                <p>With Penn State closing the lead to 22-20, McKendree took a timeout. But the blue and white seemed to be in its rhythm, as freshman Tristan Hassel opened it up with a huge kill.</p>\n                <p>However, after a few errors on the Nittany Lions\u2019 end of the court, the score got away from them again. At a McKendree set point of 24-22, Penn State was forced to take a second timeout.</p>\n                <p>While Harvey was able to get in a kill, the second set point was won by the Bearcats, making the set final 25-23.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white opened the second set by taking the first point. But McKendree came back immediately and scored four quick points.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions were able to briefly close the Bearcats\u2019 lead to 6-4, but a long pause on the court occurred due to an error with the net camera. After it was fixed, the McKendree momentum was broken up, and the blue and white capitalized with two back-to-back points, tying it at 6-6.</p>\n                <p>At 8-8, the Bearcats started to run away with it again, scoring two quick points to make it 10-8 over Penn State. After dominating a couple of points, redshirt freshman Jaidyn Bethel got a huge block to put the blue and white back in it at 13-11.</p>\n                <p>But, after several fast points from McKendree\u2019s half of the court, Penn State called a timeout after trailing by three at 15-12. The break seemed to do some good, as the first point went to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>After a challenged play by the Bearcats\u2019 bench, their lead increased to 18-14. A few more quick points from their side forced another blue and white timeout at 20-15.</p>\n                <p>The timeout wasn\u2019t enough for the blue and white to get back in it, however. While Penn State was able to win one point after the break, McKendree took the second set 25-16.</p>\n                <p>The third set played out similarly with several back-and-forth points on both sides. In the early moments, the blue and white were playing as a tighter unit.</p>\n                <p>After trading points, Penn State took the lead for the first time in several points with an attack error from the Bearcats, making it 13-12. However, three responding points shut down the Penn State momentum, putting the Bearcats back on top.</p>\n                <p>After fighting their way back, the Nittany Lions tied it 17-17 after a service ace from Trubey.</p>\n                <p>After the Bearcats took a significant lead of 22-18, Penn State took a timeout for an attempt at recovery.</p>\n                <p>However, the McKendree momentum was too strong, and the blue and white didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p>\n                <p>While the Nittany Lions were able to prevent the first two match points, one final Bearcats\u2019 kill gave them the victory at 25-20, a clean sweep against the blue and white.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State\u2019s dominant sprint through the AHA rebounded quickly after its first conference loss to Mercyhurst on Jan. 10, when the Nittany Lions fell in overtime, 3-2. The blue and white pieced together a clean sweep over Syracuse, 4-1 and 3-2, respectively, before taking down No. 12 Cornell, 5-1, on Tuesday to close out a seven-game road trip.</p>\n                <p>To kick off senior weekend at Pegula Ice Arena, Penn State hosted Delaware at 6 p.m on Friday. Coach Jeff Kampersal secured his 500th career win as his Nittany Lions cruised to a 5-0 victory over the Fightin\u2019 Blue Hens.</p>\n                <p>Penn State improved to 23-4 on the season and 16-1 in the AHA. Goaltender Maddy Campbell got the nod and stopped all seven shots she faced in her fourth career shutout, good for tied second in the nation amongst freshmen.</p>\n                <p>From the opening puck-drop, the blue and white surged on offense. Despite having many scoring opportunities, Delaware\u2019s defensemen filled the shot lanes with blocks to halt dangerous plays. However, the pressure accounted for the Hens\u2019 depleted stamina midway through the first period.</p>\n                <p>In the first period alone, the Nittany Lions exceeded Delaware\u2019s entire shot total against Penn State this season of 11. The blue and white entered its locker room outshooting the Hens 13-0, while unable to put the puck in the net.</p>\n                <p>Not for a lack of chances, however, as Katelyn Roberts blazed down the right side wall with six seconds remaining in the opening frame. Roberts fired away, but her shot was saved by the shoulder of freshman netminder Charlotte Payne.</p>\n                <p>Penn State proved that a short intermission was all it needed to break the ice, as Grace Outwater picked up a loose puck on the doorstep and deposited it through a narrow gap between the post and Payne\u2019s extended pad.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions went on the penalty kill for the first time when Mikah Keller took a head-contact penalty with 15:55 remaining in the second period. Campbell saw her first shot of the game on that penalty kill, a leg save in tight on the post that she controlled to the opposite-side corner.</p>\n                <p>Just over a minute into the powerplay, Francesca Barresi took a trip to the sin bin for body checking. Payne stood tall in the net throughout the disadvantage to keep the game within a goal.</p>\n                <p>On offense, Delaware had a golden opportunity to tie the game as Wren Abboud flew down the middle of the ice on a breakaway. Campbell challenged the shooter and made a glove save to maintain a blank slate.</p>\n                <p>With 9:56 left to play in the second period, the Nittany Lions had a second power play opportunity when Suvina Heidt was called off the ice for high sticking.</p>\n                <p>Although the penalty concluded, the pressure continued to exhaust Delaware\u2019s defense. With 6:36 on the clock, Kendall Butze took the puck across the blue line and ripped a shot on-net that found a hole under Payne\u2019s blocker to increase Penn State\u2019s lead to two.</p>\n                <p>And the fireworks didn\u2019t stop. Danica Maynard took a body checking penalty with five minutes remaining, and came out of the box with speed. Her breakaway attempt was thwarted, but she managed to find Keller unmarked in front of the crease, who tapped in Penn State\u2019s third unanswered goal of the night.</p>\n                <p>Less than two minutes later, Grace Outwater and Maddy Christian strode down the ice on a 2-on-1. Outwater dished the puck to her linemate on the left side, who pinpointed the top left corner of the net to take a 4-0 lead going into the third period.</p>\n                <p>Through the early goings of the third period, Penn State faced increased disciplinary action when Tessa Janecke and Taylor Lum were each called for tripping. Regardless, the Nittany Lions cleared each without facing much opposition.</p>\n                <p>Once back at full-strength, Taya MacDonald found herself open along the boards. With 9:03 remaining in the game, she sniped the puck over Payne\u2019s right shoulder to take a 5-0 lead.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions coasted to the final buzzer, securing their third win this season over the Hens.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State returns to Pegula Ice Arena on Senior Day tomorrow at 2 p.m for Game 2 against Delaware.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASEBALL COVERAGE</p>",

The last time the blue and white saw Grand Canyon was in 2018, when they were swept in a three-game series. The Nittany Lions last saw Kansas State 19 years ago, losing to them 5-0 and 4-1 in 2007.</p>\n                <p>Richmond</p>\n                <p>Following the invitational, Penn State pivots towards Virginia for a three-game series against Richmond beginning just five days after its meeting with Kansas State.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white faced Richmond in February of last season, dominating 17-6 in one game. Penn State posted a good offensive day, with 33 at-bats, three home runs and 13 total hits.

    "title": "Column | Projecting Brooke Klosowicz\u2019s stateline after historic 2025 season",
    "author": "Gianna Dowling | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>It\u2019s May 2, 2025, the opening game of Penn State\u2019s final regular season series against Washington. Bottom of the seventh inning, down 5-2, the Nittany Lions have runners on first and second with two outs. Brooke Klosowicz steps up to the plate with a chance to do what no other player in program history has done \u2013 record 50 RBIs in a season.</p>\n                <p>The Johnsburg, Illinois, native quickly faced a 1-1 count, but locked and loaded on the third pitch. Klosowicz sent the ball over the center field fence, bringing her season RBI total to 52 for a new program record.</p>\n                <p>Penn State ended up falling to the Huskies 9-5 in nine innings, but nonetheless, it was a momentous day for Klosowicz and the cherry on top of an extraordinary sophomore campaign.</p>\n                <p>In addition to RBIs, Klosowicz also set a single-season program record with 23 doubles. The junior utility player completed the 2025 season with a .422 batting average and .851 slugging percentage, which were both top-10 in the conference.</p>\n                <p>Klosowicz led the Nittany Lions with 65 hits, 131 total bases and finished tied for a team-high 13 home runs. All the while, managing to strike out just 11 times.</p>\n                <p>The difference between the beginning of this year and last is that now Klosowicz has plenty of hype surrounding her name. It\u2019ll be hard for the junior to match last season's numbers, but that\u2019s not saying it can\u2019t be done. Klosowicz has proven to be the leader of the Penn State offense and could help lead the team back to the postseason.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look at some of the projected stat lines for Klosowicz before she and the rest of the Nittany Lions gear up for the regular season.</p>\n                <p>Batting average</p>\n                <p>The blue and white will face some tough competition in the circle this year. Five of the arms in D1 Softball\u2019s top-25 preseason pitcher rankings are a part of a staff that Penn State will face, including two of the top three.</p>\n                <p>Klosowicz\u2019s toughest battle will be in the regular season finale when the Nittany Lions host Nebraska. The Cornhuskers are led by the reigning Big Ten Pitcher and Player of the Year, Jordyn Frahm.</p>\n                <p>In the blue and white\u2019s Big Ten Tournament game against Frahm last season, Klosowicz went 0-for-2.</p>\n                <p>Another top arm that Klosowicz will have to face is Tennessee\u2019s Karlyn Pickens, who helped lead the Lady Volunteers to the Women\u2019s College World Series semifinals last season.</p>\n                <p>Given the state of Penn State\u2019s opponents and schedule, I don\u2019t think Klosowicz will put up as high a batting average this season. However, great hitters always find a way to produce, so I still think Klosowicz will finish somewhere around the .350 - .400 range.</p>\n                <p>Hits and RBIs</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions lost last season's second and third RBI producers from 2025, Haylie Brunson and Maddie Gordon, to graduation. It\u2019s due to this that I think Klosowicz will put up similar, if not better, numbers in the hits and RBI categories to lead the Penn State offense.</p>\n                <p>I think it\u2019s a safe bet to make that the junior once again reaches, or breaks the 50 RBI mark. While Klosowicz will be facing some tough arms, I don\u2019t doubt that she\u2019ll record a 60-plus hit season once again. In fact, Klosowicz could find herself closer to the 70-75 mark if she reaches full potential.</p>\n                <p>Finally, I also see Klosowicz having another impressive season in recording extra-base hits. It\u2019ll take a lot for the utility player to break the single-season double record again, but it's not impossible. However, I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be the case. Instead, I could see Klosowicz ending with a double count of a clean 20, give or take.</p>\n                <p>Klosowicz\u2019s 13 home runs placed fourth in a single season in program history. I think Klosowicz will surpass this number in 2026. Cassidy Bell holds the record with her 20 home runs in the 2013 season. I don\u2019t see the junior reaching this mark, but there\u2019s definitely a way that Klosowicz can put herself at second, given she hits at least 16 long balls.</p>\n                <p>No matter how the numbers ultimately shake out, Klosowicz will be the centerpiece of Penn State\u2019s offense and one of the most dangerous bats in the Big Ten, and record books may once again be within reach.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>After a trip to the Midwest last week, Penn State welcomes a team from the Midwest in Indiana for a Friday night dual meet to continue the Big Ten season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will host the Hoosiers at 7 p.m. Friday in Rec Hall before the highly anticipated Bryce Jordan Center dual on Jan. 30 against Nebraska. The teams last met in Rec Hall where Penn State came out on top 46-0.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s how this year\u2019s dual matches up.</p>\n                <p>125: No. 1 Luke Lilledahl (PSU) vs. No. 12 Jacob Moran (IU)</p>\n                <p>Luke Lilledahl jumped to No. 1 in the InterMat rankings while maintaining his undefeated record. He\u2019s controlled many matches this season, keeping up with his \u201clightning\u201d pace.</p>\n                <p>On the other side, Jacob Moran has just one loss on the season. He fell by major decision to Nic Bouzakis of Ohio State, who\u2019s currently the No. 2 wrestler in the country.</p>\n                <p>Despite a potential early feeling out process, Lilledahl\u2019s result could be similar to that of Bouzakis\u2019 win over one of the Hoosiers\u2019 top wrestlers.</p>\n                <p>133: No. 4 Marcus Blaze (PSU) vs. Logan Frazier (IU)</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze escaped his first major test against Iowa and will face an unranked opponent in Logan Frazier.</p>\n                <p>Frazier fell by tech fall to Ohio State\u2019s Ben Davino, who\u2019s ranked above Blaze at No. 2 at 133 pounds. With the Nittany Lion\u2019s blazing ability to score, a bonus-point victory is very much in the picture.</p>\n                <p>141: No. 11 Braeden Davis (PSU) vs. No. 25 Henry Porter (IU)</p>\n                <p>Braeden Davis dropped his first match of the season in his second dual match of the campaign. He\u2019s now the permanent starter at 141 pounds and has an opportunity to earn a ranked victory over Henry Porter.</p>\n                <p>Porter holds a 9-3 record, and has dropped all three matches to ranked wrestlers. His matchup with Davis will be one of his bigger tests after showing off his ability to stay on top of a wrestler.</p>\n                <p>149: No. 1 Shayne Van Ness (PSU) vs. Joey Buttler (IU)</p>\n                <p>Shayne Van Ness is the start of what could be the most dominant part of a lineup in wrestling history. He\u2019s the second No. 1 wrestler of six for the Nittany Lions and has ended matches early against unranked foes.</p>\n                <p>Buttler has a 9-7 record and will face his toughest opponent. The Hoosier will have to get off to a strong start, as Van Ness has been prone to give up an early takedown. Despite this, Van Ness often responds, still ending matches early despite going down early.</p>\n                <p>157: No. 3 PJ Duke (PSU) vs. Bryce Lowery (IU)</p>\n                <p>Similar to Blaze, Duke also faced a major test in Carver-Hawkeye Arena and came out victorious. He\u2019ll take on an unranked Bryce Lowery for another likely easier battle.</p>\n                <p>Lowery is 7-5 and with Duke\u2019s speed, he could get back to a highly offensive matchup and score in bunches, leading to an early finish.</p>\n                <p>165: No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink (PSU) vs. No. 19 Tyler Lillard (IU)</p>\n                <p>Mitchell Mesenbrink won\u2019t have wrestled in a dual in a week since the Iowa matchup when he takes the mat against Tyler Lillard. Mesenbrink won by forfeit on Sunday against Northwestern as the Wildcats didn\u2019t weigh in a 165-pound wrestler.</p>\n                <p>Lillard will be facing a machine in Mesenbrink, who, like Duke, scores a lot of points and very quickly. This season, Mesenbrink has added an emphasis to back points and attempting to go for falls, as he continues to prove he\u2019s far ahead of the rest of his competition.</p>\n                <p>174: No. 1 Levi Haines (PSU) vs. No. 29 Derek Gilcher (IU)</p>\n                <p>Levi Haines also has pushed for back points, utilizing many different positions to get the nearfall swipes. He\u2019ll take on Derek Gilcher, who\u2019s 9-5 on the season.</p>\n                <p>Gilcher is in his first full season at 174 pounds after wrestling at both 165 and 174 last season. Against the top wrestler in the weight class, he could be in for a very quick night with Haines\u2019 constant aggression and overpowering ability in his second season at the weight.</p>\n                <p>184: No. 1 Rocco Welsh (PSU) vs. No. 15 Sam Goin (IU)</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh is the new No. 1 wrestler at 184 pounds after defeating then-No. 1 Angelo Ferrari of Iowa in tiebreakers. After a much slower-paced match, he got back to his offense against Northwestern. Despite this, when he faces ranked opponents like Sam Goin, he has a tendency to be on the more defensive side.</p>\n                <p>Goin\u2019s chance to win will be solely on if he can finish on his attacks. Welsh has given up minimal points throughout the season, which has allowed him to be less offensive and still be successful.</p>\n                <p>197: No. 1 Josh Barr (PSU) vs. No. 14 Gabe Sollars (IU)</p>\n                <p>Josh Barr has proven he\u2019s in a tier of his own at 197 pounds, and could be in for a big postseason after finishing as the national runner up a season ago.</p>\n                <p>Sollars sits at 8-5 with his losses piling up after the Big Ten schedule began. In the dominant conference, Barr has continued to shine while Sollars has started to fall, potentially a sign of how the Friday night matchup will go.</p>\n                <p>285: No. 12 Cole Mirasola (PSU) vs. Caleb Marzolino (IU)</p>\n                <p>Mirasola is riding high after some major victories in his last few matches. He\u2019s back up to No. 12 in the rankings and will face yet another unranked wrestler.</p>\n                <p>When he takes on an unranked wrestler, he\u2019s much more offensive and can showcase his quickness and IQ, something he takes pride in.</p>\n                <p>Not only is Caleb Marzolino unranked, but he\u2019s also closer to the size of Mirasola, who\u2019s considered an undersized heavyweight for the class. That should play to the favor of Mirasola as the potential closing match of the dual.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Elliott Inscho | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse will play seven out-of-conference games this season, with a few coming against highly-ranked opposition.</p>\n                <p>The non-conference slate will see the Nittany Lions play four games at Panzer Stadium, two on the road and one at a neutral site as part of The Crown Classic.</p>\n                <p>While most programs use the non-conference games as an opportunity to warm up in the cold winter months, Penn State may not get that opportunity. The Nittany Lions will play three ranked teams in the opening weeks, each of which is ranked in the top six of the Inside Lacrosse preseason poll.</p>\n                <p>Colgate</p>\n                <p>A date with Colgate will open the year at home for the blue and white, an opponent that has become a favorite for coach Jeff Tambroni to schedule as the Nittany Lions\u2019 first of the season.</p>\n                <p>This year will mark the third consecutive season where Penn State plays the Raiders to begin the year, with the blue and white going 1-1 in those matchups.</p>\n                <p>Colgate went 10-8 last season, and 4-4 in Patriot League play. The Raiders were led by sophomore Liam Connor with 90 points in 2025, but he\u2019s out of the picture after transferring to Georgetown. Their most productive returner will be senior Hunter Drouin, who recorded 32 goals and 16 assists for the Raiders last season.</p>\n                <p>Villanova</p>\n                <p>Next on the schedule for the Nittany Lions will be the Villanova Wildcats, who went 4-1 in Big East play and 8-7 overall before falling in the second round of last year\u2019s Big East tournament.</p>\n                <p>Villanova also lost its top scorer from last season, with attackman Matt Licata graduating at the end of the year. Colin Michener will be the Wildcats\u2019 most prolific returner, having scored 26 goals and recording 14 assists in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has won two straight games against the Wildcats and holds a 21-9 all-time record against them.</p>\n                <p>No. 2 Princeton</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will play their first high-level opponent on Valentine\u2019s Day when they take a trip to New Jersey to face No. 2 Princeton.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers went 13-4 overall and 5-1 in the Ivy League last season before falling to Syracuse in a 19-18 thriller in the quarterfinal round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n                <p>With Coulter Mackesy off to Boston as the Cannons\u2019 No. 4 overall pick in last season\u2019s PLL draft, star attackman Nate Kabiri will step into an even larger role this season for the Tigers. The junior tallied 61 points last season, second only to the departing Mackesy\u2019s mark of 63.</p>\n                <p>Navy</p>\n                <p>Penn State will stay on the road after the Princeton game, traveling to Annapolis for a meeting with Navy.</p>\n                <p>Navy went 8-7 in 2025, with a 4-4 mark in Patriot League play. Last year\u2019s meeting between the Nittany Lions and Midshipmen saw Penn State pull out a 13-7 victory at home in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Returning senior Mac Haley led all Navy players with 43 points, with Jack Ponzio and William Goers each returning after having seasons of 30 or more points.</p>\n                <p>Yale</p>\n                <p>The final day of February will see the Nittany Lions take on Yale at home.</p>\n                <p>Yale is the Nittany Lions\u2019 only non-conference opponent with a losing record last season, going 5-8 with a 3-3 mark in the Ivy League.</p>\n                <p>After a subpar season, things may only be getting harder for the Bulldogs as their top four scorers graduated after last season. Senior attackman David Anderson, who recorded 21 points for Yale last season, will be the most productive returner.</p>\n                <p>No. 4 Cornell</p>\n                <p>Tambroni will face his former team at his current home when No. 4 Cornell travels to face the Nittany Lions on March 7. While the Big Red are only No. 4 in the season-opening poll, they\u2019re coming off a nearly undefeated run to a national championship last season.</p>\n                <p>Cornell went 18-1 overall and an undefeated 6-0 in the Ivy League. Its last matchup with Penn State came on Memorial Day weekend, when the Big Red defeated the Nittany Lions 11-9 in the NCAA Semifinals.</p>\n                <p>Perhaps the biggest reason the Big Red are ranked No. 4 after an almost perfect season is the departure of CJ Kirst, who scored an NCAA record 247 goals at Cornell. 82 of those goals came last season on the way to a 115-point season for Kirst.</p>\n                <p>Junior attackman Ryan Goldstein will have a chance to match Kirst\u2019s 2025 numbers after an already impressive 93 points last season.</p>\n                <p>No. 6 North Carolina</p>\n                <p>Penn State will close its non-conference slate on March 14 with a neutral-site game against No. 6 North Carolina in Charlotte.</p>\n                <p>The Tar Heels went 10-5 in 2025 with a 3-1 record in ACC play. North Carolina made an appearance in the NCAA tournament despite a 14-7 loss to Duke in the ACC tournament, but it lost to Richmond in the first round.</p>\n                <p>Attackmen Owen Duffy and Dominic Pietramala will return to Chapel Hill this season, a duo that combined for 112 points last year.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Sami Altmire | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State women\u2019s gymnastics is back home on Sunday, taking on its neighbors to the south, Maryland. The Nittany Lions are looking for a great meet in Rec Hall after a successful week 2.</p>\n                <p>Penn State has started out their Big Ten schedule with a win after a showdown with Illinois. A 196.075-194.100 win got the Nittany Lions into the No. 4 spot on the Big Ten rankings and No. 17 in the NCAA rankings.</p>\n                <p>There is confidence with the Nittany Lions; now the question is whether they can continue to use it as they go through the rest of their season, facing Big Ten opponents, especially ones like Michigan.</p>\n                <p>The Terrapins are also going into this meet very strong and having a lot of confidence. They are coming off four-straight wins, with three of those being in the Terrapin Quad. Maryland\u2019s most recent win was against Washington, beating them 194.265-193.575.</p>\n                <p>Vault has been a really strong apparatus for Maryland, with it having a very successful week 2 in the event. Three standout gymnasts that not only excelled on vault, but also really stepped out for the Terrapins were Katrina Mendez-Abolnik, Rayna Engelmayer and Taylor Rech.</p>\n                <p>Mendez-Abolnik put up a great performance and landed a 9.850, and Engelmayer and Rech both put up a score of 9.825.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white also have a history of being strong on vault, with most of its lineup excelling on the event. Against Illinois, Jessica Johanson scored a 9.825, and in its opening meet against Yale, multiple 9.800 and above scores, with standout performances by Ava Cash, who put up a 9.850, and Allison Kaempfer, who put up a 9.825.</p>\n                <p>The uneven bars might be an area where Penn State could excel, with Maryland looking at scores in the 9.700 range so far this season, and putting up an average of 9.750 last season for most of their gymnasts. The blue and white have a history of excelling in the uneven bars rotation, and bars were where a lot of points were racked up against Illinois last Friday. Ava Piedrahita scored a 9.925, and Dani Latronica scored a 9.875.</p>\n                <p>Beam will be a rotation that both teams have looked at improving on, and both teams have leaned on rotating their lineups, trying to find gymnasts who can really focus and excel on beam with an opportunity to get those scores up.</p>\n                <p>Maryland had an average of 9.6408 on beam in 2025, and that score is looking the same so far in the 2026 season. Penn State had an average of about 9.7480 in the 2025 season, and, similar to Maryland, are looking to be in that range so far in the 2026 season. Beam will be an event to watch with both the Terrapins and Nittany Lions being equally equipped.</p>\n                <p>Floor can be a crucial part of this meet, with a lot of great routines from both sides being brought out. The Terrapins\u2019 Madeline Komoroski had a great night on the floor against Washington last Saturday, scoring 9.875. Rech followed closely behind with another standout score of the night, 9.850. Penn State\u2019s Latronica also put down a great routine, with a score of 9.875, so seeing a Latronica-Komoroski matchup could be very interesting.</p>\n                <p>These teams have a lot of talent, a lot of it being equal in quality. They can put on a great show on Sunday and get a lot of important points going into the rest of the Big Ten season, and the 2026 season as a whole.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s headed to Sarasota, Florida, to compete in the Sam Mikulak Invitational. The Nittany Lions are set to take on multiple teams, including fellow Big Ten member, Illinois.</p>\n                <p>This is the last meet for the blue and white before it begins the Big Ten season, which means that this invitational can be a great opportunity to finalize their lineups going into Big Ten territory, and also figure out what needs to be fixed.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is also looking at qualifying chances for one of their all-around gymnasts, Landon Simpson, who just punched his ticket to the Winter Cup, which is a qualifying event for the 2026 Xfinity U.S. Gymnastics Championships.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are looking at success going into week 3, with a win against Army in week 1 and first place in the West Point Open in week 2. They have the confidence to do well in this invitational and have the opportunity to really start off strong against their fellow conference teams.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white can also get a step up on Illinois, who it will not only cross paths with this weekend but also in the Big Ten opener on Feb. 1. The Fighting Illini have been falling short of a win so far this season, coming in third at the OSU Open against Ohio State, Michigan and Greenville University.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will also face off against two club teams: the Florida Storm and EVO Senior Men\u2019s Elite team. These two club teams consist of multiple gymnasts not competing for a university, but are competing at a collegiate level.</p>\n                <p>Illinois had a consistent 2025 season, with floor, highbar and parallel bars having consistent team scores across the whole season. Matthew Vu Nguyen is a really strong gymnast for the Fighting Illini, having high scores of 14.250 on vault, 14.050 on parallel bars and 13.400 on high bar. Garrett Schooley is another great candidate for all-around high scores, as he has a high of 14.300 on floor and 14.450 on vault.</p>\n                <p>Illinois needs to gain its confidence back this meet, but the Nittany Lions are looking at continuing their winning streak. The blue and white have had two standout gymnasts these past two weeks with one being Simpson, and the other Matthew Underhill. Both have put up high scores that pushed their team above its competitors.</p>\n                <p>Underhill\u2019s scores of 13.350 on floor, 13.750 on still rings and 14.300 on vault contributed to a large gap in the cumulative team results of the meet.</p>\n                <p>Both collegiate teams will be looking at each other this weekend as a way to set the tone for their future matchup. There is competition awaiting them both in the form of the club teams also participating, but both the Fighting Illini and the Nittany Lions will be focused on handling each other.</p>\n                <p>MORE GYMNASTICS COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Women\u2019s lacrosse is almost back.</p>\n                <p>Penn State kicks off its season on the road at Richmond on Feb. 7 before playing a total of eight nonconference games to start the season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have faced the Spiders 12 times over the years, holding a near perfect record with 11 wins. Last year, Richmond edged out the blue and white with a 12-10 win.</p>\n                <p>The Spiders failed to make it to the NCAA tournament last year after falling in the second round of the Atlantic 10 tournament.</p>\n                <p>While they lost their two leading goal scorers in Colleen Quinn and Grace Muldoon to graduation,Richmond picked up Syracuse transfer Meghan Rode and Georgetown transfer Rileigh Meyer during the offseason, who\u2019ve made a combined 42 career starts.</p>\n                <p>Following the trip to Richmond, Penn State returns home to face UMass in its home opener on Feb. 11. The two teams haven\u2019t faced each other since 2013, but the blue and white holds a 9-0 all-time record.</p>\n                <p>After starting the season 2-3, the Minutemen won the next 13 straight, including the Atlantic 10 championship. UMass then fell to Princeton in the first round of the NCAA tournament, 19-10.</p>\n                <p>The Minutemen return redshirt senior Kassidy Morris for her final year. Last season, the Washago, Ontario, native finished tied for sixth in the country with 78 goals.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will then host Bucknell on Feb. 15 in what will likely be their easiest game of the year.</p>\n                <p>Penn State holds a 22-0 all-time record over the Bison, including a 16-4 win last year. Bucknell went 6-10 last year with a 1-6 record on the road.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white\u2019s matchup with Pitt on Feb. 18 is a newer rivalry, having only played four times in program history. The Nittany Lions hold a 3-1 lead in the series.</p>\n                <p>Since only reaching NCAA status in 2021, the Panthers have seen increasing success from four wins in 2023 to eight last year \u2014 including a win over Penn State.</p>\n                <p>This year, Pitt lost its leading scorer from last year, Jenna Hendrickson, who scored 46 goals. However, it bolstered other parts of the squad, adding St. Bonaventure\u2019s goalkeeper Katelyn Hicks, who made the seventh-most saves in a single season in Bonnies\u2019 history.</p>\n                <p>After three straight home games, the blue and white travel to Philadelphia to face Drexel on Feb. 22.</p>\n                <p>Penn State started the series strong with eight straight wins, but has lost three of the last four matchups with a 9-3 all-time record.</p>\n                <p>After a 14-4 season, which culminated in the Dragons falling in the CAA championship game to Stony Brook, they then lost two of their top-three scorers, who combined for over half the team\u2019s points.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions remain on the road and travel north to Cornell for a matchup on Feb. 28. Penn State holds the all-time lead 15-4.</p>\n                <p>For the past several years, the Big Red have been on the cusp of tournament play, but didn\u2019t make either the conference or NCAA tournament last year with a 9-6 record.</p>\n                <p>While Cornell has seen steady play recently, Colgate had a much-improved year last season. The Raiders \u2014 who Penn State hosts on March 4 \u2014 went 9-8 last year after back-to-back years of less than five wins.</p>\n                <p>Colgate will have an opportunity to build on that success with the return of its three leading scorers from last year, including sophomore Aubrey McMahon, who could continue to grow with the Raiders over the next three years.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will play their last away nonconference game on March 8, travelling to the West Coast for a game against San Diego State in the teams\u2019 first-ever matchup.</p>\n                <p>The Aztecs are a struggling team who only posted three winning seasons in the past 10 years. Over the past two seasons, they\u2019ve tallied just seven wins.</p>\n                <p>Penn State wraps up its nonconference schedule by hosting Princeton on March 15. The Tigers are Penn State\u2019s only ranked nonconference opponent, entering the season at No. 6.</p>\n                <p>Princeton is also the only out of conference opponent this season that the Nittany Lions have a losing record with, sitting at 14-29 all time.</p>\n                <p>The Tigers enter 2026 fresh off a 16-4 season with a trip to the NCAA quarterfinals. They will be without last year\u2019s 89-goal scorer in McKenzie Blake, but have Jami MacDonald, who scored 58 goals last year, back for her senior year.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE CONTENT</p>",

Who I will become after all is said and done.</p>\n                <p>By bus, plane, train and car, I am leaving far beyond.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m leaving the country where I\u2019ve spent twenty years exploring corners unturned, tides unexplored, walking in the footsteps of Florentine philosophers, artists, poets and astronomers.</p>\n                <p>I\u2019m becoming someone new without anyone there to see my departure or my arrival. Will the city of the Renaissance become a home for my own rebirth? Will I recognize ambition in its birthplace?</p>\n                <p>Florence, to me, feels both like a test and a teacher.

Will I walk where Machiavelli once did and learn what ambition truly demands? Will I look into the same night sky as Galileo and feel the courage it takes to question the universe as it\u2019s handed to us?</p>\n                <p>If I close my eyes, will I understand how Michelangelo painted creation itself, or how Leonardo da Vinci imagined a final supper before it was ever sacred? In my opera class, will I sing in the language of romance and longing, hoping to recreate something close to what Mozart once intended? Perhaps I will trace the strokes of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus\u201d and feel the reverence for beauty in every curve.</p>\n                <p>What if what waits on the other side of this door is a love I cannot take home with me, only clinging to the memories of a place I know my heart will belong to? What if I cry in a vineyard, learn what\u2019s hidden inside the grapes each glass of wine is made up of?</p>\n                <p>Soon, I will roam streets with soulmates I have yet to meet, embark on adventures I\u2019m only just beginning to book. My soul longs for the familiarity of a place I have never experienced in this body.</p>\n                <p>What awaits me in a city that does not yet know my name? Will I uncover the secrets of my own small universe, the way so many before me once did? What lessons await me in Piazzas that have seen centuries unfold?</p>\n                <p>As I revel in the heavens, look out on the balcony at terracotta roofs, I will picture the life I\u2019m leaving behind for a short while.

    "title": "Dueling column | Should Penn State fire men\u2019s basketball coach Mike Rhoades?",
    "author": "Will Horstman & Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>There\u2019s only been one season in Penn State\u2019s 130-year history when it failed to earn a conference win.</p>\n                <p>It happened in the 1935-36 Eastern Intercollegiate Conference season in which the Nittany Lions went 0-10. Yet nine decades later, Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad is on track to become the second conference winless team in program history.</p>\n                <p>With a 0-8 Big Ten record to start the 2025-26 season, Rhoades\u2019 seat seems to have warmed up in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>Will Horstman: If Penn State wants to move on from Mike Rhoades, right now presents an opportunity</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall lacked energy as Wisconsin earned a 98-71 win over Penn State on Thursday night, dropping the Nittany Lions to 9-10 on the year and 0-8 in Big Ten play. Some fans online have voiced displeasure with Rhoades, who\u2019s in his third season leading the team.</p>\n                <p>If Penn State\u2019s administration also wants to move on from Rhoades, I believe an opportunity to do so is right now. This year\u2019s start has been subpar, and trends dating back to last season don\u2019t provide a positive outlook on Rhoades succeeding in the future with the Nittany Lions.</p>\n                <p>Penn State won nine Big Ten games during Rhoades\u2019 first season in Happy Valley with another conference win against Michigan in the Big Ten tournament. The Nittany Lions started the 2024-25 season 12-2, including an upset over No. 8 Purdue.</p>\n                <p>Since then, however, the Nittany Lions are 13-23 after Thursday\u2019s loss to the Badgers. To make matters worse, only four of those wins are against Big Ten teams, which all came in the latter portion of last season.</p>\n                <p>The other nine wins are all Quad 4 victories from this season\u2019s nonconference schedule as Penn State has yet to defeat a power-conference opponent this year. I\u2019m concerned for the Nittany Lions as I feel Rhoades\u2019 tendencies and style of play might have been figured out by the rest of the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>What\u2019s also concerning is that Penn State shows a lack of adjustments in games. The Nittany Lions had a 13-12 lead over Wisconsin right before a media timeout on Thursday, and the Badgers came out of it by generating a 50-22 advantage at halftime.</p>\n                <p>Multiple games this season have seen Penn State get in a similar situation and endure a blowout loss, like Indiana\u2019s 113-72 win on Dec. 9 or Maryland\u2019s 96-73 victory last Sunday.</p>\n                <p>To be fair, the Nittany Lions have kept some contests against top competition close, such as a 74-72 loss to then-No. 2 Michigan earlier this month. But 13 single-digit losses have piled up since Jan. 5, 2025, and recent results make it hard to feel those moral victories are making any progress toward building a program.</p>\n                <p>It feels like rock bottom for Penn State at this point in the season, and even though I didn\u2019t have many expectations for this year, the lack of effort on defense exhibited by players at times sort of showcases how the season has gone so far.</p>\n                <p>I have a great deal of respect for Rhoades \u2014 he\u2019s brought success to other teams he\u2019s coached, and it\u2019s possible he could end up guiding Penn State to become a better team than it has been. Rhoades and the Nittany Lions are a finalist for 2026 5-star guard Dylan Mingo, who would help Rhoades\u2019 efforts to turn Penn State around if he were to commit.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades also gave a good answer when asked about the future of Penn State.</p>\n                <p>\"Building a program is really, really hard. Building a program at a place that doesn't have much basketball tradition is even harder, but I signed up for it, man, and I believe in me,\" Rhoades said postgame Thursday night. \"I believe in how we do things. Some of you guys may not. I don't really care. I never cared before, but I'll figure it out. It might kill me, but I'll figure it out.\"</p>\n                <p>However, it\u2019s fair to be concerned about the current state of the Nittany Lions, which is increasingly making it tough to envision a bright future. It\u2019s early in Rhoades\u2019 tenure, but a reset on the program might not sound like the worst idea to Penn State\u2019s administration if it wants to look elsewhere for a coach.</p>\n                <p>Myles Hannak: He\u2019s on his last lifeline, but it\u2019s too early to pull the plug</p>\n                <p>Penn State men\u2019s basketball isn\u2019t good and historically hasn\u2019t been.</p>\n                <p>The program made the Final Four only once, in 1954, and there persists a feeling that the Nittany Lions aren\u2019t a \u201cbasketball school.\u201d Yes, that notion is correct, and recent history only reinforces that, yet the man in charge for most of those recent years, Rhoades, isn\u2019t to blame.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades is in the midst of his third season, and after a pair of season finishes around .500, this year seems like it may end up even worse. However, if you believe those results warrant change, let me attempt to sway things.</p>\n                <p>Since 2000, there have been five head coaches in Happy Valley: Jerry Dunn, Ed DeChellis, Pat Chambers, Micah Shrewsberry and Rhoades. Dunn went 35-54 in the new millennium, Chellis didn\u2019t post a winning season until his sixth year, while Chambers didn\u2019t do so until his fourth.</p>\n                <p>The lone boss to endure quick success, Shrewsberry, backstabbed Penn State after his second year to leave for Notre Dame, and left big shoes for Rhoades to fill as the next hire. In his second year in charge, Rhoades posted a winning season, and now, even as the record regressed, he brought in the program's best-ever recruiting class, offering optimism that, if given more time, results will prevail.</p>\n                <p>Those around the team need to level expectations \u2014 what exactly is the goal on the hardwood? It should be to provide little wins, boost optimism and change the program's narrative, all things that, in the historical scheme of things, have already been done during Rhoades\u2019 tenure.</p>\n                <p>Yes, Penn State now has more talent on its roster than in the past, both a negative and a positive for Rhoades, given he\u2019s able to attract it yet hasn\u2019t immediately translated it into results.</p>\n                <p>However, the grass isn\u2019t always greener, and ditching Rhoades would disrupt the process of what is being built in Happy Valley. Yes, it\u2019s bad now, but you don't get to sunshine without letting the clouds clear first, and Rhoades is the lone boss out there willing to throw himself into the eye of the storm.</p>\n                <p>Penn State isn\u2019t an attractive job; the administration will always prioritize the other athletic departments over basketball, it\u2019s just the culture, yet Rhoades is the only man to actually attempt to challenge that culture, not just work within the constraints.</p>\n                <p>Home fan attendance at Penn State has been a concern. While much of the belief in men\u2019s basketball comes from within the program, if those supporting the team showed the same resilience, fans would see that the team's future is more promising than any win total suggests, as it currently seems to be defined by nothing more than that.</p>\n                <p>If there were a basketball coach fired, Rhoades shouldn\u2019t be the frontrunner, as women\u2019s basketball coach Carolyn Kieger endured just as tumultuous results, and has been extended the grace of seven seasons with only one with a winning record \u2014 Rhoades deserves that same patience.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>In recent years, Penn State has made it a tradition to return to the venue where it all started, Rec Hall, with its brick exterior, decades worth of team photos and a plethora of banners won throughout its storied history.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions stepped onto the hardwood with a chance to tap into Rec Hall\u2019s rich history, as the blue and white haven\u2019t enjoyed the luxuries of being in the driver's seat this year.</p>\n                <p>Yet for nearly all 40 minutes of game action, the opposing Wisconsin Badgers held all the control and continued that disappointing trend this season, eventually drowning the Nittany Lions with an emphatic 98-71 win. With the defeat, Penn State fell to 9-10 and stood winless in conference play after eight games.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI appreciate the administration and our physical plan for getting everything ready for us to play at Rec Hall and all that stuff, and it's a great game. We didn't live up to our end of it,\u201d Mike Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades\u2019 teams played in Rec Hall every year of his tenure, in an attempt to cultivate a greater basketball culture, yet every crushing defeat, especially in the same place where the program posted its best season ever in 1954 and earned its lone NCAA Final Four appearance, counteracts that effort. This year\u2019s loss marks consecutive blowouts at Rec Hall, with its only win coming off a 90-89 upset over Illinois in 2024.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have to have a level of urgency in the program to move forward, and I'll do that,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe've shown at times this year. We played good basketball, but not good enough basketball to win in the Big Ten.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions, despite what metric or angle taken, failed to display why they\u2019re better than the record suggests, and it\u2019s shaping up to be a heartbreaking season in the grand scheme of things. Penn State brought in the top Big Ten recruiting class this year, and its highest all-time recruit, yet the outlook for the future doesn\u2019t seem to change the narrative of the past.</p>\n                <p>Despite it being the third year of the \u201cReturn to the Rec\u201d and a White Out, during which students in attendance received free towels, it didn\u2019t seem to fill the stands, as the venue failed to reach 6,000 in capacity for the first time since Penn State added the occasion under Rhoades.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI've coached a long time. I've been on both ends of this. This right now sucks,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI'll tell you this thing, my staff and I will give every piece of every fiber we have to try to right this ship \u2026 I'm not a quitter, and I hope our fans and our students support these kids, because they're good kids, and they're working really hard. But you're right, you've got to win.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While it appears those around the team may have seen their faith fractured, the Nittany Lions aren\u2019t phased, which reaffirms how Penn State has endured basketball success previously. Although the recent memories of Rec Hall are rather bitter for the blue and white, the venue symbolizes the unwavering excellence that the university\u2019s athletics embodies.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're on the same team, one team. We know our record isn't the best, we're just trying to move forward and reflect and just come back the next day better,\u201d freshman wing Mason Blackwood said. \u201cWe all committed to Penn State for a reason\u2026 There's no better way to go through it than together. The season\u2019s not over.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have 12 games left, and they\u2019ll search for any chance to finish with a note of optimism, not just for gratification, but to signal to the masses that they are trying and that history will not define or take away from that effort.</p>\n                <p>\u201cBuilding a program is really, really hard. Building a program at a place that doesn't have much basketball tradition is even harder, but I signed up for it,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201c I believe in how we do things. Some of you guys may not \u2013 I don't really care, I never cared before. But I'll figure it out. It might kill me, but I\u2019ll figure it out.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State went to work in the first transfer portal window with Matt Campbell at the helm, bringing in 40 total players with 24 of them being from his former team in Iowa State.</p>\n                <p>Here are 10 new additions to keep an eye on.</p>\n                <p>Rocco Becht, quarterback</p>\n                <p>The first name on the list is an obvious one in quarterback Rocco Becht, who will be the starter next season.</p>\n                <p>He transfers to Penn State after four years at Iowa State, starting in three of them and winning 26 games. Becht threw for 9,274 yards and 64 touchdowns as well as 27 interceptions to go along with 499 yards and 19 scores on the ground.</p>\n                <p>Becht follows Campbell, offensive coordinator Taylor Mouser and quarterbacks coach Jake Waters from Ames, Iowa, to State College, giving him familiarity.</p>\n                <p>Time will tell if Becht will be a full-go or even available for spring practice, as he\u2019s coming off of a 2025 campaign where he had a partial labrum tear in his left shoulder, and an AC sprain in his right shoulder.</p>\n                <p>He recently posted on his Instagram during his visit to Penn State wearing a sling.</p>\n                <p>Marcus Neal Jr., safety</p>\n                <p>Becht is the most impactful addition on the offensive side of the ball, but for the defense it\u2019s safety Marcus Neal Jr.</p>\n                <p>Neal is coming off of a 2025 campaign where he started as a sophomore, notching 40 total tackles, three pass breakups and two interceptions. The year before, he appeared in all 13 games a freshman where he garnered 18 total tackles.</p>\n                <p>He was rated as a 4-star transfer per 247Sports, ranking as the No. 143 player overall and No. 9 safety. Neal is more than likely the favorite to replace Zakee Wheatley, who exhausted eligibility and declared for the NFL draft.</p>\n                <p>Caleb Bacon, linebacker</p>\n                <p>Penn State brought in a trio of key former Iowa State linebackers who were, but of the three, Caleb Bacon is the one to keep an eye on.</p>\n                <p>He finished his time with the Cyclones by appearing in 35 games, posting 131 total tackles, five pass breakups and two forced fumbles.</p>\n                <p>Bacon is a walk-on turned scholarship player as well as a former captain. He was rated a 4-star transfer, the No. 118 overall player and the No. 4 linebacker.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s a good chance Bacon starts alongside Rojas next year with Amare Campbell transferring to Tennessee and Dom DeLuca graduated.</p>\n                <p>Benjamin Brahmer, tight end</p>\n                <p>Benjamin Brahmer was the first player to transfer from Penn State, and he is a worthwhile addition.</p>\n                <p>The tight end is coming off of a 2025 campaign where he was the third-leading receiver for Iowa State, totaling 37 receptions for 446 yards and six touchdowns.</p>\n                <p>He was second-team All-Big 12 a year ago, and recorded 75 catches for 977 yards and nine scores during his time with the Cyclones.

    "title": "Rec Hall Rout | Penn State men\u2019s basketball dominated by Wisconsin in annual Rec Hall game",
    "author": "Chase Mitchell | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Rec Hall and The Palestra have something in common. It\u2019s not just the fact that they were both designed by the same architect.</p>\n                <p>Designed by Charles Z. Klauder, Rec Hall was completed in 1928. Just a year prior, Klauder\u2019s other design, The Palestra, opened in Philadelphia.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s not where the similarities between the two arenas end, though, as Penn State has now lost in both historic venues this season.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions welcomed 13-5 Wisconsin but had its Rec Hall reunion ruined, falling to the Badgers 98-71 to remain winless in conference play and fall into a now six-game losing streak</p>\n                <p>\u201cBuilding a program is really, really hard,\u201d Mike Rhoades said. \u201cBuilding a program at a place that doesn\u2019t have much basketball tradition is even harder, but I signed up for it, man, and I believe in me.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin won the opening tipoff, but Kayden Mingo opened the scoring for the evening after a little bit of back-and-forth.</p>\n                <p>Mingo called his own name again, hitting a step-back jumper to put the blue and white up 4-0 in the early running.</p>\n                <p>Penn State let the Badgers work it to a 9-8 Wisconsin lead quickly after some soft defense and a three-pointer given up for a one-point deficit that lingered for a while.</p>\n                <p>Thanks to an Ivan Juri\u0107 board that led to a Freddie Dilione V and Melih Tunca connection, the Nittany Lions moved back in front and seized the momentum, even picking up a foul.</p>\n                <p>A near four-point play became three-straight charity stripe makes for Braeden Carrington, which once again gave the Badgers a comfortable lead at 23-13, forcing Rhoades and the blue and white into a timeout.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions fell into an 18-point hole after a tough possession from Juri\u0107 and Mingo ended without a score, which made Penn State take another one of its timeouts.</p>\n                <p>It only got worse from then on out for the blue and white, as a three-pointer from Andrew Rohde and another one from Carrington contributed to a 21-1 Wisconsin scoring run that made it a 42-17 Badger lead with just under three minutes left in the first half.</p>\n                <p>The student section voiced its dismay with boos, \u201csell the team\u201d chants and other jeers as Penn State went to the locker room at halftime, facing a 50-22 deficit. Josh Reed and Wisconsin\u2019s Austin Rapp exchanged words and got a little chippy after the buzzer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have nothing to lose,\u201d Reed said. \u201c(We\u2019re) just going out there and trying to play as hard as we can every single game and see where it takes us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>A Wisconsin travel call was the only thing that went the blue and white\u2019s way in the early running of the second half as the Nittany Lions went nearly three minutes without a score.</p>\n                <p>Mason Blackwood knocked one down to cut it to a 60-30 deficit, but any chance Penn State had of making it competitive was well behind it. There was no shortage of scoring for the Badgers, though, with everyone getting in on the action as three exceeded the double-digit mark.</p>\n                <p>With just 11 minutes remaining in a game that was already a blowout, a three-pointer from Reed followed by Dilione and Mingo scores at least kept the student section alive.</p>\n                <p>Some physical defense from Mingo, still donning the face shield, wasn\u2019t enough to stop the Badgers from making it a 31-point game on an extended possession that ended in a Nolan Winter basket.</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin was shooting 40% from three-point range when a Zach Kinziger three-ball gave his squad a drowning 84-47 advantage. The Badgers ended the night 15-35 from that range for 43% compared to the Nittany Lions\u2019 8-27, with Reed shooting 100% from three-point range.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe best way to keep a team from hitting a lot of threes is limiting the number of attempts,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cMy teams have done that, and we\u2019re not doing, and we\u2019re getting really behind. When you get behind, you\u2019re giving good shooters shots, they get going, then they start attacking you.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The once-excited crowd at the annual game diminished to about the size of a pep rally halfway through the second period, with many sarcastically cheering anytime Penn State chipped away at the 35-point gap.</p>\n                <p>A Dilione scoop-and-score was one of the few blue and white highlights in the second half, but just a few minutes later, the clock read zeros and showed the Badgers as the victors, capturing a 98-71 win.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe all came here to play basketball. We all committed to Penn State for a reason,\u201d Blackwood said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better way to go through it than together. Season\u2019s not over.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>With Kayden Mingo and Freddie Dilione V now back in the lineup for Penn State, the Nittany Lions are just without forward Tibor Mirti\u010d, who was listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d with a knee injury that he is rehabbing.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Still winless in conference play, Penn State looks to snap its six-game losing streak when it heads to Columbus to take on Ohio State on Monday.</p>\n                <p>Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>",

It was his first real test, similar to fellow freshman and 133-pounder Marcus Blaze.</p>\n                <p>Blaze faced national finalist Drake Ayala. Similar to Duke, Blaze won his matchup 4-2, needing just one takedown to get the job done.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe both have pretty similar mindsets,\u201d Duke said. \u201cSo, no matter where it is, whether it's in practice or an actual match or wherever, just try to be the same person as always.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Duke faced a wrestler who was on the defensive side more than the offensive. For a wrestler like the Nittany Lion who enjoys putting up a lot of points, it was a much different match than what he\u2019s used to.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, he remained centered and relaxed, and pounced on the opportunity when it arose, giving him the only takedown of the match.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI would say I was kind of chasing him a little but he was more defensive, and I would say most of the Iowa teams got more defensive the whole time, and just had to be patient,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI knew an opening would eventually come and once it did, I took advantage of it, took him down and that was pretty much the match.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The true freshmen have taken the wrestling world by storm this season. Not just Duke and Blaze, but the entire class, including Oklahoma State\u2019s trio of Ladarion Lockett, Sergio Vega and Landon Robideau. Duke and Blaze are in a very strong position to eventually be at the top of the rankings in their respective weight class.</p>\n                <p>Even with being the top-two ranked wrestlers in the Class of 2025, the success Duke has had wasn\u2019t anticipated. Most freshmen don\u2019t have the capabilities to start 11-0, like Duke is currently. Additionally, most freshmen go the early redshirt route, and in Duke\u2019s case, the redshirt would\u2019ve been an easy path with preseason national title favorite Tyler Kasak at the same weight class.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, Duke is the 157-pound wrestler for his freshman season and could very well win the national title.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI would definitely be pretty surprised,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to be where I am now, and I put in a lot of work in the past. I think I hold myself to a pretty high standard, so I\u2019ll definitely be proud of myself.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Duke already into the top three in his weight class, Penn State\u2019s team could very well exceed the point total of last year\u2019s record-setting team at the NCAA Championships. The way things are run at Penn State is unlike anywhere else, as the team continues to raise the ceiling year in and year out.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI would say a lot of teams aren\u2019t like that,\u201d Duke said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s successful and everyone wants each other to get better. Most of the time when people are successful, they break it down. But not here, it\u2019s way different. Everyone wants you to get better, to do better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Editorial | Students are already using AI. Universities should teach them how.",
    "author": "The Daily Collegian\u2019s editorial opinion is determined by its Board of Editors, with the editor-in-chief holding final responsibility for content.",
    "description": "<p>From AI-enabled medical devices to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence has transformed the way we work and live. Yet many universities and professors are responding to this shift with avoidance instead of education, leaving students unprepared to enter an AI-driven workforce and navigate the technology\u2019s ethical complexities.</p>\n                <p>This approach is ignoring what\u2019s already happening on college campuses. According to <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford University\u2019s 2025 AI Index Report</a>, 86% of students utilize AI for school work, while 61% of faculty incorporate it into their teaching.</p>\n                <p>As AI becomes increasingly accessible, universities have a responsibility to equip students with the skills demanded by a changing workforce and to educate them about algorithmic bias, environmental harm, plagiarism and accuracy concerns.</p>\n                <p>Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, CoPilot and Gemini have gained popularity in recent years, but artificial intelligence itself is not new. For decades, other forms of AI have been used for data analysis, pattern recognition and automation.</p>\n                <p>What distinguishes generative AI is its ability to create text, images and code using existing data. Its capacity to produce original-seeming work has driven concern surrounding academic integrity and sparked conversations over what constitutes appropriate versus unethical use in both classrooms and everyday life.</p>\n                <p>Despite this, only 39% of academic institutions had an AI-related acceptable use policy as of early 2025, according to Stanford\u2019s report. While Penn State doesn\u2019t have a university-wide AI policy, it implements course-specific policy and provides general guidelines for both students and professors.</p>\n                <p>Last year, Penn State launched an artificial intelligence engineering major and minor, making it stand out among universities preparing future engineers to build and refine these systems.</p>\n                <p>However, AI\u2019s influence extends far beyond engineering. This technology is rapidly entering fields across the liberal arts, business, journalism, healthcare and many other disciplines.</p>\n                <p>Whether we like it or not, this integration is largely beyond our control, as employers across industries are already using AI tools to cut costs, increase efficiency and remain competitive.</p>\n                <p>What is within our control is how we\u2019re navigating it.</p>\n                <p>Universities should not encourage students to have AI complete their work for them. Instead, institutions and professors must teach students what AI is already being used for in their respective industries, and when it shouldn\u2019t be used and why.</p>\n                <p>While universities are still deciding how to approach AI in the classrooms, it\u2019s evident that education on the matter is essential in preparing graduates who will work alongside AI in their careers. Acting as though AI doesn\u2019t exist or banning its use outright is disservicing students.</p>\n                <p>Fear-based conversations don\u2019t prepare students for life after graduation; thoughtful, honest discussions about the realities and future of AI do.</p>\n                <p>Understanding both the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology not only prepares students for the inevitable but provides them with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their AI use.</p>\n                <p>As AI use expands, it is imperative that conversations about misuse, along with environmental and societal impacts, expand as well.</p>\n                <p>According to <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2024/07/the-uneven-distribution-of-ais-environmental-impacts\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review</a>, the training process for one AI model releases carbon emissions equivalent to those of hundreds of homes nationwide and has caused severe stress on our freshwater resources. These impacts disproportionately burden vulnerable communities.</p>\n                <p>The rise of generative AI has also intensified ethical concerns around plagiarism, originality and accuracy. Because these tools generate content based on existing material, students must be taught how to use them in appropriate contexts and how to properly evaluate and verify AI-produced information.</p>\n                <p>AI systems are also prone to factual errors and bias, making human oversight imperative. Without instruction on when AI use crosses ethical boundaries and when it can be used responsibly as a tool, students are left to navigate these risks on their own.</p>\n                <p>Furthermore, AI bias stems from both explicit and implicit human biases embedded in various stages of its pipeline, from data collection and labeling to model training and deployment, according to <a href=\"https://www.chapman.edu/ai/bias-in-ai.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Chapman University</a>. The system has already produced unfair and discriminatory bias in reporting, sourcing and continues to reinforce existing biases.</p>\n                <p>As AI continues to evolve and become used on a wider scale, it\u2019s of the utmost importance that higher education institutions educate their students on how AI is utilized and how to engage with the technology responsibly.</p>\n                <p>A comprehensive AI education should force people to rethink the way they engage with artificial intelligence.</p>\n                <p>The Daily Collegian Opinions Editor Teresa Phelan can be reached at tpp5354@psu.edu.</p>\n                <p>MORE EDITORIALS</p>",

    "description": "<p>Being the linebackers coach at Penn State comes with an expectation to churn out elite talent from the program known nationwide as \u201cLBU.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Matt Campbell picked his guy for that job on Jan. 2, bringing Tyson Veidt over from Cincinnati to oversee the linebackers. Dan Connor, who was the linebackers coach in 2025, is set to remain on staff and will do more day-to-day coaching with that position group.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what to know about the Nittany Lions\u2019 new linebackers coach.</p>\n                <p>Coaching history</p>\n                <p>Veidt has spent the last two seasons as the Bearcats\u2019 defensive coordinator, but the initial report of his hiring to Penn State said the two parties mutually agreed to part ways. Cincinnati allowed 25.6 points per game under Veidt in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Prior to his short stint at Cincinnati, Veidt worked under Campbell for eight seasons as Iowa State\u2019s associate head coach and linebackers coach. He was named the Football Scoop National Linebacker Coach of the Year in 2017 and earned a Broyles Award nomination the year after.</p>\n                <p>Veidt had all three of his starting linebackers earn All-Big 12 honors in three straight seasons from 2017-19 and helped coach 45 all-conference defenders during his time with the Cyclones.</p>\n                <p>Campbell originally found Veidt at Toledo, where the linebackers coach spent the 2014-15 seasons. Veidt also served as the recruiting coordinator for the Rockets.</p>\n                <p>Veidt was the head coach at Bluffton University, a Division III school in Ohio, from 2008-13. He helped his squad break 40 records at a school that had won just one game the year before Veidt\u2019s arrival.</p>\n                <p>His coaching career began at Muskingum University, where he played collegiate football from 1992-95. Veidt joined as a graduate assistant in 1997 before moving laterally to Indiana in 1999.</p>\n                <p>A year later, Veidt returned to his alma mater to be the defensive coordinator, a role he held from 2000-03. In 2004, he joined West Virginia as a graduate assistant but returned to calling plays in 2006 for Saint Vincent in Pennsylvania.</p>\n                <p>Prominent players coached</p>\n                <p>Veidt coached plenty of successful linebackers at Iowa State, including Willie Harvey and Jake Hummel.</p>\n                <p>Harvey earned three straight All-Big 12 honorable mentions from 2016-18 and finished his career with 289 tackles, 31 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks. He signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent in 2019 and is now in the United Football League, where he\u2019s earned two All-UFL team selections.</p>\n                <p>Hummel played at Iowa State from 2017-21, tallying 228 tackles, 18 tackles for loss, two sacks and three interceptions across his career. He went undrafted in 2022, but signed with the Los Angeles Rams, where he spent three seasons before signing with the Baltimore Ravens in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Veidt also coached a pair of All-Americans at Iowa State in Joel Lanning and Mike Rose. Lanning was a First Team All-America selection in 2017 after converting from quarterback to linebacker in his very last season as a Cyclone.</p>\n                <p>Lanning tallied 114 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, six sacks and one interception in his lone year as a linebacker. He signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2018, marking his lone year in the NFL.</p>\n                <p>Rose was named the Big 12 Defensive Most Valuable Player in 2020 as a junior and was selected as a freshman All-American by the FWAA. The Ohio native wound up finishing his career with 41 tackles for loss and signed with the Kansas City Chiefs as an undrafted free agent in 2022. He is now with the St. Louis Battlehawks of the UFL.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "3 key games to watch in No. 7 Penn State men\u2019s lacrosse\u2019s 2026 regular season",
    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 7 Penn State, after blazing a path to the NCAA National Semifinal game at Gillette Stadium, generally faces a difficult schedule year-after-year. Being a member of the ever-competitive Big Ten, as well as consistently scheduling quality non-conference opponents, there are a plethora of important games to gauge the long-term success of the coming 2026 season.</p>\n                <p>Here are my picks for the three most important games of the Nittany Lions\u2019 upcoming regular season.</p>\n                <p>Penn State vs. Colgate | Feb. 1</p>\n                <p>In the all-important season opener, Penn State will host Colgate at Panzer Stadium to kick off the fresh calendar with a rematch of 2025\u2019s NCAA Tournament first-round matchup.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions faced the Raiders twice last season, winning both games despite the two being spread out throughout the year. On Feb. 1, 2025, Penn State opened its season with a 14-9 victory over Colgate at home. Then, on May 10, the blue and white defeated the Raiders 13-11, advancing to the National Quarterfinal.</p>\n                <p>Colgate returned its fourth-highest goal-scorer in Hunter Drouin, who tallied 32 goals and 16 assists last season. However, the Raiders\u2019 top-three producers have since graduated or hit the transfer portal, making their offensive core appear vastly different.</p>\n                <p>Penn State vs. No. 4 Cornell | March. 7</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have a chance at taking their revenge on the team that eliminated them in the National Semifinals: No. 4 Cornell per Inside Lacrosse.</p>\n                <p>Despite falling in the tournament, the blue and white were the only team in 2025 to beat Cornell. And it was a thriller, to say the least. On March. 8, Penn State clawed back from a four-goal deficit with under three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. In overtime, senior Ethan Long dealt the final blow and secured a road victory over the eventual national champions.</p>\n                <p>But nothing else mattered in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on May. 24. With a national championship berth on the line, the Nittany Lions fought to a 5-4 lead going into the second half. However, a six-goal third quarter from the Big Red widened the gap too far for the blue and white\u2019s comeback attempt. Penn State lost 11-9.</p>\n                <p>And that was with Penn State silencing Cornell\u2019s most elite attackman, Tewaaraton Award winner CJ Kirst. However, many of the Big Red\u2019s top-performers graduated as well, including Kirst, presenting a new look for the defending national champions.</p>\n                <p>But if there\u2019s anything that the collegiate lacrosse world knows about Cornell, it\u2019s that coach Connor Buczek\u2019s teams are tough to beat, no matter who\u2019s on the field.</p>\n                <p>Penn State vs. No. 1 Maryland | March. 21</p>\n                <p>The Big Ten is a gauntlet of a conference and although the Terrapins didn\u2019t win the Big Ten championship, Maryland went all the way to the National Championship game before being taken down by Cornell, 13-10.</p>\n                <p>Penn State will open Big Ten play at Panzer Stadium against Maryland at 3 p.m on March. 21.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions met the Terrapins twice in 2025, first in the regular season, where the then-second ranked team in the nation defeated the blue and white 13-8 in College Park, Maryland. Then, in the Big Ten semifinals, Maryland defeated Penn State 10-8 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>\n                <p>After going 14-4 overall last season, the Terrapins were ranked No. 1 in Inside Lacrosse\u2019s Preseason Media Poll. On offense, Maryland retained star-attackman Eric Spanos as well as rising senior Braden Erksa.</p>\n                <p>Spanos was the Terrapins\u2019 leading scorer last year, netting 36 goals while adding 19 helpers for a team-high 55 points. Meanwhile, Erksa wasn\u2019t far behind with 33 goals and 15 assists.</p>\n                <p>With the national runner-ups maintaining much of their attacking power, Maryland is set to make another deep run in both the Big Ten and national tournaments. The game against Maryland presents one of Penn State\u2019s biggest tests of the season.</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Preview | No. 4 Penn State women\u2019s hockey returns home for series against Delaware",
    "author": "Dominic Megats I The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>No. 4 Penn State earned its first sweep of the new year as the Nittany Lions left New York with two wins over Syracuse. The series featured four different goal scorers for Penn State over the course of seven goals. Syracuse gave the Nittany Lions a scare to conclude the series; however, it could pose as a step in the right direction. After a brief stint of unsuccessful games, the blue and white followed the series with a win over No. 12 Cornell.</p>\n                <p>Penn State now shifts its focus to its first home series of 2026 against another conference opponent in Delaware. The teams previously met on Oct. 10 and Oct. 11. The Nittany Lions swept the Blue Hens with two shutouts at Fred Rust Ice Arena.</p>\n                <p>Senior weekend</p>\n                <p>Several seniors and graduate students receive honors throughout the upcoming series against the Blue Hens. Tessa Janecke, Mya Vaslet, Katelyn Roberts, Katie DeSa, Kendall Butze, Maddy Christian, Leah Stecker and Taylor Lum will all be a part of a memorable moment that will be etched in their lives.</p>\n                <p>All players successfully did their part throughout the season. From breaking records to being a reliable goal scorer with the puck on their stick. These athletes made their presence known in their final year of collegiate hockey. With a few weeks left in the season and postseason on the rise, expect to hear these names more before the season is all said and done.</p>\n                <p>Blocked shots bonanza</p>\n                <p>An interesting stat jumps out when looking at the Delaware team. The Blue Hens led the conference in blocked shots as a team with 616, averaging just under 24 per game. That number sits 200 more than the second-place team.</p>\n                <p>The defensive unit excelled at defending their net, clogging shooting lanes and putting their body on the line. Penn State suffered a few blocked shots over the season, some of which were taken the other way. This area of their game will need to be adjusted to avoid costly turnovers.</p>\n                <p>To do so, the Nittany Lions need to elevate the puck and create routine, quick passes to open up shooting lanes.</p>\n                <p>Possible advantage?</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions played three games in five days over the weekend and into the week. However, Delaware hasn\u2019t played since Jan. 17. This could result in slower line changes and breakouts than a slightly more rested Blue Hens team.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, travel could play a role, as Penn State\u2019s game against the Big Red was held in New York as well. Ultimately, the Nittany Lions have less time than normal to practice and study for their upcoming series.</p>\n                <p>Enter DeSa, Exit Janecke and Nicole Hall</p>\n                <p>Katie DeSa returned to the lineup against Cornell after missing the previous four games with an apparent injury suffered in the series against Ohio State. Picking up where she left off, the senior looked stellar in net as she made 24 saves on 25 shots, only allowing one goal early in the second period.</p>\n                <p>However, on the forwards front, this series will be the last before both Janecke and Hall depart for Milan, Italy, to participate in the Winter Olympics. The Nittany Lions have been playing without their freshman goal-scorer, Matilde Fantin, for the previous few games. With the addition of two other goal-scorers leaving, the forward depth of Penn State will be challenged in the series to come.</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Ashley Beres | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>With the 2026 season just around the corner, Penn State has a chance to bounce back after a rocky 2025 campaign. The Nittany Lions came up short of reaching the NCAA Tournament after reaching it in 2024, following their loss to Nebraska in the Big Ten quarterfinals and finished the year with a 25-27 record.</p>\n                <p>The blue and white raked in the batter\u2019s box last season and set multiple new single-season program records in batting average, home runs, RBIs, runs scored and total bases. Many of the squad\u2019s heavy bats come from the infield.</p>\n                <p>Clarisa Crowell\u2019s infield is spearheaded by a few returning players and a lot of fresh faces.</p>\n                <p>Juniors Kaylie Walters and Michela Barbanente will offer veteran leadership inside the diamond. Walters was an offensive anchor for the blue and white last season as the primary shortstop. The Philadelphia native started all 52 games and had a .350 average with 42 hits in 120 at-bats.</p>\n                <p>However, Walters must clean up her defense as she committed the most errors on the squad with 10 in the 2025 campaign.</p>\n                <p>Barbanente was the Nittany Lions\u2019 primary second baseman last season and she produced a solid offensive campaign. The Itasca, Illinois, native started 49 of her 51 appearances and slashed .284, with 33 hits, eight home runs and 36 RBIs in 116 at bats.</p>\n                <p>Penn State also bolstered its infield depth and brought in graduate transfer Cara Bohner. The Towson transfer is a dependable bat, holding an impressive .292 career average with 128 hits. The Danville, Pennsylvania, native can also flash the glove, with a career fielding average of .947.</p>\n                <p>The lefty batter primarily played the middle infield positions defensively over her three seasons with Towson, but she can also be stretched across the infield and outfield.</p>\n                <p>After catcher Audree Mendoza transferred, the blue and white now have a battle for the starting position behind the plate between Kirsten Finarelli, Madison Seidel and Macy Chamberlin.</p>\n                <p>Finarelli was the lone 2025 recruit for her position in Happy Valley. The Lehman, Pennsylvania, native was a nationally ranked catcher prospect as the No. 41 ranked player in her signing class and No. 21 among catchers. As a three-sport athlete in high school, Finarelli is versatile and can also play across the infield.</p>\n                <p>The freshman was named the Pennsylvania 3A Player of the Year for her 2024 campaign and earned a Wyoming Valley Conference All-Conference selection in every season of her high school career.</p>\n                <p>While Finarelli will be a key piece of Penn State throughout her career, the starting position battle is mostly between Chamberlin and Seidel.</p>\n                <p>After missing the second half of last season due to injury, sophomore Chamberlin is set for her return to action. The Wauseon, Ohio, native started 20 of her 26 appearances in the 2025 season, slashing .321 with 17 hits in 53 at bats. She committed zero errors, but caught just two base runners last season.</p>\n                <p>However, the starting nod will most likely go to the veteran Seidel. The senior started 33 of her 43 appearances last season for Penn State, after not seeing much of the field during her freshman and sophomore campaigns.</p>\n                <p>The Hilltown, Pennsylvania, native slashed a .247 average with 23 hits and 15 RBIs in 93 at bats in 2025. While Seidel has committed zero errors throughout her career, she also caught just two runners while allowing 32 stolen bases last season.</p>\n                <p>The highest-ranked recruit in the 2025 class for the Nittany Lions was Allison Oneacre. The Alpharetta, Georgia, native was the No.19 ranked national recruit, via Extra Inning Softball and the fifth-ranked infielder in the class.</p>\n                <p>During her career at Milton High School, Oneacre was a four-time First Team All-Region choice from 2021 to 2024, along with All-State honors in 2023 and 2024. Oneacre is expected to be a big bat in Crowell\u2019s lineup as she batted .598 with 101 hits and 84 RBIs over 55 games played at Milton High School.</p>\n                <p>Freshman Kalli Karwowski will also be a new infielder bat for the blue and white. The Peckville, Pennsylvania, native has championship experience as she led Valley View High School to the 2024 District 4A Title and 2025 PIAA State Championship. She earned NFCA All-Region status after the 2024 campaign and garnered All-Star and All-State accolades in each of the last four seasons.</p>\n                <p>With plenty of new infielders and some returners, there\u2019s no shortage of bats for Penn State\u2019s upcoming season.</p>\n                <p>MORE SOFTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Ashlyn Kafer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Starting off shaking the floors of their apartment with the vibrations from their music, the members of Sarasota went from playing small gatherings for friends to invigorating hundreds at local fraternity parties and bars in downtown State College.</p>\n                <p>Sarasota is a State College cover band featuring vocalist Adianna Von Wiegand, guitarist Mark Robertson, guitarist and vocalist Jackson Mopsick, bassist and vocalist Ben Swihart and drummer Jacob Cho.</p>\n                <p>The band got its feet on the ground in fall 2024, beginning with Roberston, Mopsick and Cho jamming out together in the living room of their shared apartment.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI got invited to live in this house, and I asked Jacob to come live with me,\u201d Robertson, a fourth-year studying finance and Spanish, said. \u201cThe house was called Sarasota, and it just so happened that Jackson was also living in the house. We hadn\u2019t ever met Jackson until the day we moved in, and he happened to play guitar.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Swihart joined shortly after, completing the foundation of the group. Sarasota took its final form after Von Wiegand partitioned the band for a vocalist spot at a performance at the end of the fall 2025 semester, transforming her musical theater prowess into rock and pop-centric melodies.</p>\n                <p>\u201cRight at the end of last semester, I went to Sig Ep because I was taking my friend on a tour to see all the frats when she was visiting,\u201d Von Wiegand, a second-year studying political science and philosophy, said. \u201cThere was a band playing \u2018Charleston Girl\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Wow, they\u2019re really good, I should totally go up there and make this about myself.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                <p>After playing with the band to test her skills, the members fell in love with her vocals and she was soon welcomed into Sarasota with open arms to begin the spring semester as a lead vocalist.</p>\n                <p>The band takes huge pride in audience enjoyment, tailoring its setlist to tracks that people might be listening to on their walks to class or can sing along to with ease.</p>\n                <p>Tom Petty, Oasis and Bruno Mars are only some of the artists Sarasota pulls from, hoping to ensure its sound can reach diverse audiences and keep listeners engaged throughout the entire performance.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEverytime we play a show and play a song that everybody in the crowd is singing and having a great time to, it hits me in my soul,\u201d Swihart, a third-year studying advertising/public relations, said. \u201cI could cry seeing that \u2014 giving the people the opportunity to have fun and just let loose.\u201d</p>\n                <p>With Robertson, Mopsick and Cho graduating this spring, the band also tries to ensure that its setlist reflects music the members enjoy producing, translating how they interact with each other during practice onto their audiences when performing live.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPlaying live is such a rush,\u201d Cho, a fourth-year studying materials science and engineering, said. \u201cWe can practice playing the song, or practice twice a week, but when you play it on stage, it\u2019s a completely different feeling. In addition to making a fun atmosphere for everyone, it\u2019s really rewarding.

Junior McKenna Young, a transfer, brings experience and frontrunner for conference play.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions have 53 games ahead of them, and these are the top games to watch.</p>\n                <p>Season opening in the Sunshine State</p>\n                <p>Going into the season, the blue and white face five different opponents in Clearwater, Florida, for the NFCA Classic. Starting their season off with a double header, facing Missouri, then Boston College.</p>\n                <p>Opening weekend in early February in Florida for the Nittany Lions is a major spotlight on how the rest of the season could play out. Facing teams from the Power Five conference.</p>\n                <p>The top two games to tune in for are definitely the season opener against Missouri. An SEC conference team that is used to high competitors and Penn State\u2019s performance against the Tigers is an important game to view. The result of the game will be a major outlook of what the season will be.</p>\n                <p>BYU will be the next must watch.

At this point of the season, it\u2019s crucial to keep up good efforts as the season is still far from over in late March.</p>\n                <p>Closing the regular season with a home series against Nebraska is pivotal time.

    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s volleyball is off to a fast start, winning its first four matches of the season and dropping only two sets total.</p>\n                <p>However, the Nittany Lions head to Illinois to take on No. 15 McKendree for their first road trip of the season at 7 p.m. Friday and 5 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>McKendree had an uphill climb to start the season, causing it to get off to a slow start, dropping matches against No. 1 UCLA and No. 3 Long Beach State. The Bearcats suffered a sweep in both matches.</p>\n                <p>McKendree bounced back at the UC Invitational, claiming a 3-1 victory over the University of Charleston and a 3-0 victory against Mount Olive.</p>\n                <p>This week\u2019s battle against Penn State will be McKendree\u2019s first home matches of the season, where it was dominant last year, winning 13 of 15 on their home floor. On the opposite side of the net, Penn State was .500 away from Happy Valley last season.</p>\n                <p>Heading into the matchup, both teams have been led by their stars early this season.</p>\n                <p>Sean Harvey seized the reins so far, collecting 48 kills and only 11 errors through four matches. Gaige Gabriel and Matthew Luoma have also performed well thus far, each with 28 kills. If the blue and white frontline can hit efficiently and keep the pressure on the Bearcats\u2019 backline, they give themselves a good shot.</p>\n                <p>For the Bearcats, they\u2019re being led by a trio of their own. Tyler Tripp and Bryce Wetjen each have 41 kills, and Sam Hoskin trails them with 36 so far this season. As a squad, the Bearcats struggled on the serve, only creating 17 aces and 60 errors.</p>\n                <p>Similarly, Penn State hasn\u2019t been dominant in serving the ball, ranking 22nd in the NCAA with 1.50 aces per set. McKendree is a few spots below, at 1.31 aces per set.</p>\n                <p>Dominating play at the net will be integral in coming away with victories this weekend, as both teams created success by attacking this season.</p>\n                <p>Penn State is hitting .319 compared to McKendree\u2019s .294; both rank in the top 21 in the NCAA. Penn State and McKendree faced off only one time in 2019, with Penn State grabbing the home victory.</p>\n                <p>Both teams are hot and come into the double header on win streaks, but one\u2019s momentum is coming to an end this weekend.</p>\n                <p>MORE VOLLEYBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Editor\u2019s Note: Off the record is a weekly column written by a third-year Collegian staffer writing under an alias. It aims to promote a space for honest conversations about love, sex and relationships. Those interested in sharing their experiences or submitting a topic are invited to do so through this anonymous <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN3-6OltwIgABgnHZTEIgmDbsnjaW3yYkbiVVFkdv4vV4m1w/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">form</a>.</p>\n                <p>Dearest reader,</p>\n                <p>This just in, graduating Greta is finding it difficult to feel confident in the dating world as her graduation is quickly approaching.</p>\n                <p>With no clue where she'll be in six months, committing to \u201csomething real\u201d feels nearly impossible. After all, why fall head over heels for someone when there may be a looming expiration date? The mere thought of long-distance with someone she hasn't known that long is enough to make her skin crawl.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHelp?\u201d Well, Greta, you\u2019ve come to the right person.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s the truth no one tells you before graduation: no one knows where they\u2019re going to be in six months. Not you. Not your friends. Not even the 6-foot-5 man in finance with blue eyes, who \u201calready accepted a job offer.\u201d</p>\n                <p>He\u2019ll probably be crying in a Target parking lot by August, questioning capitalism and wondering why he ever chose to flirt with an Excel sheet instead of you.</p>\n                <p>Measuring where we\u2019ll be in six months is almost impossible. So much of our lives change from one season to the next and adding in a romantic partner can turn a simple math problem into an algebraic equation.</p>\n                <p>But here\u2019s the thing: not every relationship needs to survive your entire twenties to be worth starting. Not everyone is meant to be in your life forever. This goes for close friends as well (I had to learn that the hard way).</p>\n                <p>Some people are just meant to be in your life right now \u2014 your coffee date companion or your \u201cwant to come over and watch bad reality TV?\u201d person. And that\u2019s OK.</p>\n                <p>Sometimes dating isn\u2019t about building something permanent, rather it\u2019s about learning what you like, don\u2019t like and how you want to be treated. It\u2019s a reminder that you\u2019re more than just your resume and future plans.</p>\n                <p>You're still allowed to flirt. You're still allowed to feel wanted. And you're certainly still allowed to have fun.</p>\n                <p>Truthfully, yes, things may end when May approaches and you walk across the graduation stage. But that doesn\u2019t make them failures. It just makes them chapters, short chapters that still count toward the full story.</p>\n                <p>You\u2019ll never regret pouring your love into someone when there are mutual feelings involved.</p>\n                <p>On that note, who decided love needed an expiration date anyway? It's not a carton of milk. The deadline exists only because you're the one placing it there.</p>\n                <p>If you meet the right person and choose to date with intention, you and your partner will figure out how to make it work, even if that includes a shared Google calendar and an alarming number of FaceTimes.</p>\n                <p>Love doesn\u2019t end just because graduation is approaching. And neither does your ability to be happy in your romantic life.</p>\n                <p>So get out there and chase whatever, or whoever, you want. Live in the moment. Make connections and meet people. Develop feelings you absolutely didn\u2019t plan on having, because at the end of the day, emotional chaos is still better than feeling nothing at all.</p>\n                <p>Those feelings: butterflies, nerves, excitement and even heartbreak are how we know we\u2019re actually living.</p>\n                <p>Graduating Greta \u2014 I\u2019m wishing you the best of luck this spring semester. Here\u2019s hoping you finally receive your romantic desires. Considering my record, it's hard to imagine you could do worse.</p>\n                <p>Yours truly,</p>\n                <p>Miss Behave</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

No. 8 Penn State is set to begin a gauntlet of Big Ten contests, facing three of the top five teams in the next trio of series.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions start by traveling to Madison, Wisconsin, to face the No. 5 Badgers, set for an 8 p.m. puck drop Friday and an 8:30 p.m. puck drop Saturday, both hosted at the Kohl Center.</p>\n                <p>Scouting Wisconsin</p>\n                <p>This is the first time the two teams have met since the blue and white swept the Badgers in the midst of its red-hot second half last season.</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin has been exceeding expectations this season. After finishing with a 7-16-1 conference record last year and debuting at No. 20 in the preseason poll, third-year head coach Mike Hastings has led the Badgers to a consistent top-five spot since late November.</p>\n                <p>Freshman goaltender Daniel Hauser anchors Wisconsin, posting a .913 save percentage and a 2.10 goals against average in his inaugural season.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers\u2019 offense is led by forwards Gavin Morrissey and Quinn Finley.</p>\n                <p>Morrissey paces Wisconsin with a point per game, tallying three goals and 18 assists on the year. The sophomore arrives off a monster first collegiate season, including being named a Hobey Baker Memorial Award fan vote nominee, a top-3 finalist for Big Ten Freshman of the Year and earning a spot on the Big Ten All-Freshman Team.</p>\n                <p>Finley, drafted No. 78 overall by the New York Islanders in 2022, sits in second place with 19 points this season.</p>\n                <p>This won\u2019t be the first time the junior has seen a handful of Nittany Lions this year, as he was a part of the inaugural U.S. Collegiate Selects team that competed in the Spengler Cup back in December, led by Guy Gadowsky.</p>\n                <p>McKenna\u2019s return</p>\n                <p>Penn State star freshman Gavin McKenna ended the first half of the season with 18 points, and while his 14 assists led all first-years nationally, his performance fell short of what many expected the projected No. 1 overall NHL pick this year to do.</p>\n                <p>McKenna spent the holiday break earning a bronze medal with Team Canada in the World Junior Championships, where his four goals and ten assists were good for second in the tournament scoring.</p>\n                <p>Since his return to the blue and white\u2019s lineup, the Whitehorse, Yukon native logged six points in four games, and most recently recorded his first multi-goal game, potting two in the 6-3 win over Notre Dame on Saturday.</p>\n                <p>The forward\u2019s newfound momentum earned him the Big Ten Third Star of the Week this week, after pacing all players nationally with five points over the weekend.</p>\n                <p>Injuries loom</p>\n                <p>Penn State has been hit with the injury bug early in its second half.</p>\n                <p>In last weekend\u2019s first contest with Notre Dame, the Nittany Lions were forced to skate only 11 forwards after multiple skaters went down with injuries in the series prior.

    "description": "<p>Parents of 10-year-old Keaghan Faulders, Bryan and Kaitland, describe their daughter as having a \u201cspunky personality\u201d and a \u201cno-quit attitude.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After receiving a diagnosis of T-cell Leukemia in 2022, Keaghan, just shy of age 7, was scheduled for immediate surgery and treatment.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe just kind of took it in stride,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cWe enjoyed the good days, which that first year was few, far and in between, but we enjoyed the good days. The days that were a struggle, or spike in fevers, she wasn't feeling well, we stayed by her side.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Soon after the initial diagnosis, Bryan said they were introduced to THON and the Four Diamonds, and a \u201cweight was lifted off their shoulders.\u201d</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn the back of your mind, you're thinking in your head, \u2018Well, one, let's get her feeling better,\u2019\u201d Bryan said. \u201cBut two, how the heck are we going to pay for this? And how are we going to afford this down the road? And we'll figure it out, but it's going to be a long journey.\u201d</p>\n                <p>THON is the world's largest student-run philanthropy that aims to provide emotional and financial support to Four Diamonds families who have been impacted by childhood cancer.</p>\n                <p>In their third year as a THON family, the Faulders finally made it to THON Weekend after watching on TV years prior. Keaghan was \u201cover the moon\u201d to attend live, and can\u2019t wait for THON 2026.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhen we felt isolated as a childhood cancer family at the beginning, and we weren't sure who to connect with,\u201d Kaitland said. \u201cTHON really pulled us in. They kind of wrapped us up in their energy, and you don't really understand the energy until you go to THON.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Faulders family is paired with the Penn State figure skating team through the THON \u201cAdopt-a-Family\u201d program. Kaitland said they have supported her family through all of their highs and lows.</p>\n                <p>Ice skating team member and THON Chair Emma Wassel said Keaghan and her family will always be an inspiration for the group, and is the strongest girl they know.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a teammate this year, Lillie Nye, and she has gotten very involved in THON and with the Faulders the last couple of years,\u201d Wassel, a fifth-year studying integrated arts, said. \u201cShe's actually skating a tribute program to those we have lost. She will be competing with that program, which is a really cool thing for us to see.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Throughout treatment, Keaghan demonstrated impressive strength in her ability to bounce back after tougher days, according to her father.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat little spark there that she has just does not let cancer steal her joy,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cIt's just pure key. And wanting to help out where she could, when she could and giving back to the hospital. These kids are resilient \u2026 if the kids were feeling okay, they had a smile on their face, not a care in the world, and just powerin\u2019 through.\u201d</p>\n                <p>In addition to treatment in the hospital, Keaghan spent her time running her own nail salon, playing Uno with nurses and even donated her hair to create a wig for another child fighting cancer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cHer ability to connect with adults and nurses and volunteers and teachers that came into the hospital just like they're just normal people and even other kids that were battling cancer,\u201d Kaitland said. \u201cIt was quite amazing to see both her strength and her personality continue to show through no matter how she felt.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Keaghan\u2019s resilience was rewarded with remission in 2023 and a long-awaited bell ringing in May 2025 to symbolize the end of her cancer treatment.</p>\n                <p>Keaghan\u2019s father said it was one of the \u201cproudest days of his life\u201d and her mother said it symbolized survival and a thankfulness to ring the bell and celebrate its meaning after passing by it thousands of times throughout their treatment journey.</p>\n                <p>\u201cFor Keaghan and even for us, it was really more to end the fight that she never asked to face, it is just the strength that we saw behind her,\u201d Kaitland said. \u201cFor us, it just symbolized that we survived. We're so happy we got here. We're so proud.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Wassel said she was lucky enough to be personally invited by Keaghan to support her in ringing the bell at the Penn State Health Children\u2019s Hospital. Additionally, she said the team looks forward to welcoming her onto the ice rink for her first time skating.</p>\n                <p>\u201cKeaghan's story is just so inspiring for us as a team,\u201d Wassel said. \u201cA lot of us kind of grew up in a solo sport, one where we didn't really have teamwork and like that kind of level of camaraderie, and so the Faulders have such a strong team of friends and family that were and are still backing them throughout Keaghan\u2019s battle, and they show us that there\u2019s strength in leaning on those who love you.</p>\n                <p>Kaitland said \"stories like Keaghan's gives people hope.\u201d Hope to those standing THON Weekend, and hope to families facing similar challenges.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTHON is so powerful because it is very personal for the families of the cancer children, but I hope when they hear stories about a real child like Keaghan, we are a real family, and we've lived the long nights,\u201d Kaitland said. \u201cWe\u2019ve felt their fear, we\u2019ve praised the victories.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE THON CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>A Husky was barking in the cage, and it forced its way out. After containing Washington for 30 of the 40 minutes, the Huskies broke loose, only to flee from the Lady Lions\u2019 grasp.</p>\n                <p>After providing an early scare, Penn State failed to close the game in the second half, falling 81-65. This now marks a 0-9 record in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>The site of Alaska Airlines Arena hosted another ranked matchup for the Lady Lions, who faced No. 25 Washington on the road. As the clock pushed past 9 p.m. on the East Coast, the ball tipped and more of the same mistakes followed.</p>\n                <p>It was a tale of two different teams. En route to its fifteenth win, the Huskies showcased an uncommon threat against Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Averaging 19.3 points per game and co-leading the team in scoring, Gracie Merkle towered over Washington\u2019s Brynn McGauhy. At 6-foot-6, Merkle easily won the tip over the 6-foot-3 McGauhy; however, she subsequently lost the early duel.</p>\n                <p>Coach Tina Langley and the Huskies did their homework against coach Carolyn Kieger and the Lady Lions. The attack point shone bright as Washington attacked the post, drawing Merkle out of the lane.</p>\n                <p>Making her respect the shot, McGaughy's hot shooting sparked a major lead for Washington. Scoring in the double-figures in just the first quarter, Penn State was forced to make adjustments. Making McGaughy the focal point of their defensive effort, the Lady Lions mounted a comeback in the second quarter.</p>\n                <p>Merkle, who leads the nation in field goal percentage, was quiet in the first frame. Then, a sleeping beast awoke. Behind a string of stops on the defensive end, Penn State began to settle in on the other side of the floor.</p>\n                <p>Shaelyn Steele, Nyla McFadden, Tea Cleante and more of Penn State\u2019s guards aided Kiyomi McMiller and Merkle in the comeback pursuit. Penn State endured a run that gave the team a short lead before pulling the team within one point at the end of the half.</p>\n                <p>It was uncharted territory for Penn State \u2013 to be within striking distance \u2013 and it responded with an aggressive attack in the second half. Some might say a little too aggressive, as McFadden picked up a flagrant one foul.</p>\n                <p>Nevertheless, the Lady Lions picked back up where they left off at McMiller, who canned a triple and kept close with the Huskies. In a rather foreseen circumstance, the back-and-forth contest began to dwindle as Washington accelerated on the offensive end.</p>\n                <p>It was a pair of Husky guards that widened the gap early. The Alaskan-native, Sayvia Sellers, led the charge as she tallied 24 points on the night. Exploding in the fourth quarter, Avery Howell got hot from beyond the arc. She finished her night with 13 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n                <p>While McMiller sat in favor of the defense, neither McFadden, Cleante or Steele could contain Sellers and Howell. From a one-point deficit to a sizable lead, Washington had effectively broken free.</p>\n                <p>Penn State didn\u2019t have enough gas in the tank to combat the Huskies\u2019 push. While Washington ranked as one of the better defenses in the nation, Penn State\u2019s guards provided a limited scoring boost to Merkle, who finished with a team-high 19 points.</p>\n                <p>Unable to close tight games has remained a central theme of the Lady Lions\u2019 struggles.</p>\n                <p>Injury Report</p>\n                <p>For the third-straight game, Amiya Evans was out of the lineup. Washington listed Daniella McLean as \u201cout for the season.\u201d</p>\n                <p>After banging her head against the hoop late in the fourth quarter, Merkle left the game and didn\u2019t return. Her status remains questionable.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>Penn State will continue with its West Coast road trip as it faces Oregon on Saturday at 5 p.m. Following that, the Lady Lions will head back to Happy Valley to face Minnesota to close out their January slate.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Clubs and representatives involved in Penn State\u2019s entrepreneurship and innovation (ENTI) minor gathered at the Eric J. Barron Innovation Hub for the annual CommunENTI event on Wednesday evening to connect student organizations based in entrepreneurship and promote the minor to more students.</p>\n                <p>The ENTI minor helps students develop \u201cinnovative thinking, leadership skills and management and planning tools,\u201d according to Penn State Undergraduate Education. It consists of 10 concentration areas or \u201cclusters\u201d that help students develop in different disciplines and areas of academic study, which also helps students learn across academic colleges.</p>\n                <p>These clusters provide opportunities for engagement in bio-tech, digital entrepreneurship and innovation, energy transition, entrepreneurship as advocacy, food and bioinnovation, hospitality management, new media, new ventures, product innovation and social entrepreneurship. But, they also provide opportunities for students to create their own startup businesses.</p>\n                <p>Some student business owners, like Hasan Demirgil, the owner of GRND, a protein-coffee company, spoke at the event.</p>\n                <p>Demirgil explained his process in creating his physical product, protein coffee, and the brand people will associate with it. He said he hopes to start placing his product among branch campuses and other storefronts outside of Penn State in the coming year.</p>\n                <p>Other students promoted their creations, like tea and utility apps, as well. These student startup speakers served as evidence of the ENTI program in action.</p>\n                <p>Linda Feltman praised the program's interdisciplinary nature and the ability it gives students to access resources they may not otherwise have. She said many students can have access to the Smeal College of Business they would not otherwise have through the new ventures program.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of Bellisario students that declare the ENTI minor will take the new venture\u2019s cluster,\u201d Feltman, a lecturer in Penn State\u2019s Bellisario College of Communications, said. \u201cWhat\u2019s cool about it is that Smeal is very closed for their upper classes unless you are a Smeal student or unless you are an ENTI minor.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said the program makes Penn State students more attractive to job recruiters by giving them more experience in other disciplines, which not a lot of students have.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou may be learning about hospitality, but you want to understand what advertising does,\u201d Feltman said. \u201cYou\u2019re earning that credit, but it also makes you very attractive to recruiters.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Student organizations were also represented through the night\u2019s events. The Society of Women Engineers, the Blue &amp; White Society, Penn State Music Group, Happy Valley Comm, 46 Live, Penn State Media Commons, Nittany Entrepreneur Society, REACH and more were all present Wednesday night.</p>\n                <p>Amelia Severns, president of the Penn State Music Group (PSMG), was there representing her organization. Although she is not part of the ENTI program herself, Severns praised student entrepreneurs.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe focus a lot on entrepreneurship with managing artists,\u201d Severns, a second-year student in Penn State\u2019s science MBA program, said. \u201cWe have a record label team and an educational team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>She said the club she represents is also a way for students to be involved in entrepreneurship \u2014 especially if they are interested in the music industry \u2014 since Penn State doesn\u2019t offer a specific academic program for that discipline.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe learn about all of the divisions of the music industry, like management, marketing, A&amp;R and production,\u201d Severns said. \u201cWe love to have a point where we can intersect music and business here at Penn State.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Many academic clusters were also represented at the event. The food and bioinnovation group offered information and opportunities for prospective students, including the 2026 Ag Springboard Competition.</p>\n                <p>Raymond Yan compared the Ag Springboard Competition to the TV show Shark Tank. He said there, students are able to promote their ideas to win cash prizes, and the only requirement is that one teammate is a member of the agriculture college.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can go in with any idea that\u2019s related to food or agriculture,\u201d Yan, a fifth-year studying agricultural and biorenewable systems management, said.</p>\n                <p>This is just one of the hands-on opportunities offered through the College of Agricultural Sciences. They also have a partnership with the United Nations called the Penn State World Food Forum Youth Lab, which gives students the opportunity to interact with their communities and fields professionally.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s ultimately what the ENTI minor and Wednesday\u2019s program was all about.</p>\n                <p>Students also enjoyed business booths, like Happy Valley LaunchBox, which is powered by PNC Bank, that were there as tangible resources for students on the entrepreneurship path. Throughout the event, students milled about, enjoyed refreshments and networked with students, organization leaders and faculty.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a pretty incredible culture at Penn State as far as entrepreneurship, and it\u2019s one of the reasons students come here,\u201d Feltman said.</p>\n                <p>MORE CAMPUS COVERAGE</p>",

He\u2019s had five conference matchups where he was held to less than five points.</p>\n                <p>However, Stewart has reached double figures the past two games, starting with a 16-point outing on 41.7% shooting against UCLA last week. This past Sunday against Maryland, Stewart scored 17 points on 7-of-12 shooting from the field and 3-of-6 from 3-point range.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt was a nice thing, finally hit some shots,\u201d Stewart said Tuesday. \u201cBut I feel like the shots really don't dictate the game. Like a shot, it takes one second to shoot it. That doesn't define the whole 40 minutes of the game. But yeah, as a scorer, I feel like I put that on myself to go out there and have a good shooting night. I feel that really helps us as a team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Stewart had all three of his 3-point makes come in the first 10 minutes of the second half versus the Terrapins, which is when Penn State cut the lead down to 10 points despite a 96-73 loss. He added four rebounds and four assists during the game as well.</p>\n                <p>The sophomore making three deep shots is the first time he\u2019s knocked down multiple 3-pointers in a game since draining 3-of-5 against NC Central on Dec. 29. It was also Stewart\u2019s first time making at least two 3-point shots against a power-conference team this season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cProbably the most frustrating when you put in countless hours, and the results don't exactly come right away,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThat's the frustrating part. But as a shooter, you just got to keep shooting and keep trusting in the work, and eventually it'll come.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Stewart is an active defender, but he\u2019s totaled at least three fouls in each of the last five games, including fouling out against Illinois on Jan. 3. He\u2019s tallied 11 steals this season in addition to numerous deflections.</p>\n                <p>The Ocean Springs, Mississippi, native is averaging 6.9 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game through 18 appearances, including 10 starts. He\u2019s shooting 38.3% from the field, 34.2% from 3-point range and 69.2% at the free-throw line.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe dude cares so much,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI'm going to fight with that dude, and we need him to make shots. We need him to make the right plays. We need him to make shots. And that was a bright side the other day, the way he played defense. I think he got rewarded by slowing down a little bit on offense and knocking some down. So we need that from him moving forward.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Standing at 6-foot-6, from Mount Washington, Kentucky, Gracie Merkle.</p>\n                <p>For Penn State fans in attendance at the Bryce Jordan Center or Rec Hall over the past two years, they\u2019ve heard that as she\u2019s started all but three games in her Lady Lion career.</p>\n                <p>During that time, Merkle transformed herself into one of the best centers in the Big Ten, if not the nation. This year in particular, she\u2019s led the nation in field goal percentage, shooting at 74.9%.</p>\n                <p>With this accolade and many others in mind, the case has to be made: Can Merkle be the greatest center in Penn State history?</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions haven\u2019t historically been known for their centers. They also haven\u2019t had one standing 6-foot-6.</p>\n                <p>When Merkle joined Penn State in 2024, she immediately played a huge role in the paint, scoring back-to-back 20-point games during her first week in Happy Valley, including a double-double with 13 rebounds in her debut.</p>\n                <p>That success carried over through the rest of her redshirt sophomore year and into this year as she\u2019s on pace to be a top 20-career scorer in Penn State history, excluding her days at Bellarmine.</p>\n                <p>Outside of Merkle, only three other centers have surpassed that 1,490 projected point total, including Vicki Link, Andrea Garner and Kahadeejah Herbert \u2014 the No. 15, No. 13 and No. 7 scorers in school history.</p>\n                <p>However, Merkle has found success outside of just scoring points, that have built her case as the best center in Penn State history.</p>\n                <p>While the 6-foot-6 center is leading the nation by a big margin in field goal percentage, she already has the school record for single-season field goal percentage.</p>\n                <p>Last year, Merkle shot 67% from the court, going 187-for-279. This year, that number has increased significantly to 74.9%, putting a dominant lead over Abilene Christian\u2019s Meredith Mayes, who is shooting 68.2%.</p>\n                <p>Based on just previous centers, Merkle also has a large advantage over former Lady Lions in shooting percentage. Former 6-foot-4 center Amanda Brown holds the No. 3 through No.5 spot in single season field goal percentage with 59.9% and has the career record with 58.9% \u2014 a record Merkle is on track to obliterate.</p>\n                <p>To complete the trifecta, Merkle has also been dominant in rebounding over the last two years.</p>\n                <p>Since joining Penn State, she\u2019s accumulated nearly 400 rebounds and is on track to record 699 career rebounds with the Lady Lions, which would put her at somewhere around the No.15 spot in career rebounds, behind a long list of other centers.</p>\n                <p>However, the current record book includes Merkle\u2019s year at Bellarmine in her career rebounds number, already listing her at 29th. With another 340 rebounds added to her total, Merkle would finish her career in third all-time with 1,039 boards.</p>\n                <p>Despite this high number, Merkle still trails Herbert with career rebounds, who recorded 1,103.</p>\n                <p>While Merkle likely won\u2019t hold the statistical record in every category by the time her Lady Lions days are over, she\u2019ll be far up and have a dominant record with the field goal percentage. In just three years with Penn State, I believe 6-foot-6 Merkle will be the greatest center in Lady Lion history.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>Two Doritos Locos Tacos, a quesadilla, a Crunchwrap Supreme, Nachofries, a Blue Raspberry Freeze and a Baja Blast.</p>\n                <p>That was Gavin McKenna and Jackson Smith\u2019s Taco Bell order last Friday after No. 8 Penn State\u2019s 4-1 victory over Notre Dame.</p>\n                <p>Ordering a postgame meal from the iconic taco chain has become a mini tradition for the freshmen duo, who entered the 2025-26 season with lofty expectations. And if you ask them, it was key to their combined six-point night in Penn State\u2019s 6-3 win over the Fighting Irish the next night.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTaco Bell on Friday nights,\u201d McKenna said with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s me and Smitty\u2019s new treat.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Smith said the Crunchwrap Supreme, Nachofries and a Blue Raspberry Freeze he consumed last Friday powered his three-point night \u2014 the first of his collegiate career.</p>\n                <p>The speedy defenseman wouldn\u2019t commit to making Taco Bell a Friday night tradition. He said it\u2019s unlikely for road games, but when in State College for a home series, expect the freshman duo to devour their same order until it stops working.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI mean, it worked last Friday,\u201d Smith said. \u201c(Friday) was the first time we did it. We come out the next night, we win and Gavin and I both have three points. It's a little outrageous for sure, but you gotta love it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Jarod Crespo said \u201coutrageous\u201d is the perfect word to describe his teammates\u2019 Friday tradition. The Nittany Lions\u2019 alternate captain said he would throw up if he ate Taco Bell before a game, and if he ordered fast food before a Saturday tilt, Chipotle is his choice.</p>\n                <p>The clip of McKenna and Smith\u2019s Taco Bell order went viral because many hockey fans appreciated the reminder that while the Penn State freshmen are highly touted NHL prospects, they are also 18-year-old kids enjoying their college experience.</p>\n                <p>But it underscored a deeper connection between the two skaters \u2014 one formed amid a shared spotlight. With McKenna, the consensus No. 1 pick in the 2026 NHL Draft and Smith selected No. 15 by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2025 NHL Draft, lofty expectations followed the duo into college hockey.</p>\n                <p>But those expectations have only made them closer. And that connection has blossomed during the Nittany Lions\u2019 five-game winning streak.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt's been amazing playing together all year,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting better and better in the second half. We've both been really good offensively and defensively \u2026 I love playing with (McKenna). He's an amazing guy and an amazing player.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Their head coach agrees. Guy Gadowsky has noticed the connection between his star freshmen, both on and off the ice.</p>\n                <p>And as a longtime State College resident \u2014 Gadowsky is in his 14th season as Penn State\u2019s head coach \u2014 he\u2019s glad McKenna and Smith are making the most of their short stint in this small college town.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI did see (their Taco Bell order), but I don't know how to relate to it,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cIt does look like both of them are really enjoying State College and Penn State, and that's important to us. We love seeing that. This is one of the premier college towns in the world, so I'm glad to see they're enjoying it.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>To put it simply, Penn State\u2019s defense is a main factor for its 0-7 start in Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>Mike Rhoades said the Nittany Lions have played \u201cpockets of good basketball but not enough to win in the Big Ten.\u201d He cited the defense for those struggles after Maryland earned a 96-73 win over his squad last Sunday.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe consistency of our defense has been an issue,\u201d Rhoades said Tuesday. \u201cWe don't play consistently in half-court defense, just enough to get stops and continuous stops, and when we have, we haven't rebounded a high enough clip, getting clean rebounds and one-and-dones to create greater offense.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Penn State lacks a shot blocker on the roster as the team is averaging 1.4 blocks per game. Guard Melih Tunca leads the team with five blocks on the year, with big men Ivan Juri\u0107 and Sa\u0161a Ciani behind him at four blocks apiece.</p>\n                <p>As such, the Nittany Lions have typically used a doubling strategy when an opposing player reaches the interior. But the issue with doubling means that a different player becomes open, and for Penn State\u2019s defense, that opposing player is usually beyond the arc with someone running to cover the open shot.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said the Nittany Lions lose the \u201cpoint of attack\u201d on defense, which is allowing other teams to generate offense.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat it's done is it's put us in rotation,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI don't care at any level of basketball; when you get in the rotation, you're behind, and that has really hurt us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>During the Maryland game, the Terrapins shot 18-of-34 from 3-point range, good for 52.9%. Guard Diggy Coit exploded for 43 points behind 9-of-15 shooting from deep.</p>\n                <p>In Big Ten play, Penn State allows 41.7% of opposing 3-point shots to fall. Earlier this season, the Nittany Lions let up 44 points and 10-of-15 3-point shooting by guard Lamar Wilkerson during a 113-72 loss to Indiana on Dec. 9.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think it's a team effort,\u201d wing Eli Rice said Tuesday of improving the perimeter defense. \u201cI think sometimes we leave guys to kind of play one-on-one more than helping that guy. So I'll say it's a team effort, from point guard all the way down to the big man position on the floor. So no matter what position the opposing player is, I think it impacts everybody.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Even if a shot is missed, Penn State hasn\u2019t cleaned up defensive rebounds at a high level. The Nittany Lions average a -7.6 rebounding margin per game across Big Ten matchups.</p>\n                <p>Against Maryland, Penn State allowed 12 offensive rebounds for 16 second-chance points. The Nittany Lions also let up 11 offensive boards for 19 second-chance points during a 71-60 loss to UCLA last week, which Rhoades said was the reason for the result.</p>\n                <p>As Penn State\u2019s season continues, the defense getting better remains arguably the most important area to watch as the team searches for its first Big Ten victory.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe just have to improve with our defense,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cWe have to improve with our half-court defense, and some of it is just continuing to get more experience and helping some of these guys understand the tough spots we're getting ourselves in there and the why of it. And then, of course, when we do have a good possession, you got to finish it with a rebound, and we're just not doing enough of that this year.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Lyle Alenstein | Wrestling Editor",
    "description": "<p>Red and white confetti rained down at Hard Rock Stadium after Indiana won the national championship against Miami.</p>\n                <p>One of the historically worst programs among power conferences and a team that Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza labeled as a \u201cbunch of misfits\u201d went 16-0 and brought a trophy back to Bloomington, Indiana. It made it the third straight seasons a team from the Big Ten won the national title.</p>\n                <p>Long gone are the days where the Big Ten played second fiddle to the SEC. Right now, it\u2019s emerged as the premier conference in college football.</p>\n                <p>Before Indiana, it was Ohio State and Michigan that won the previous two titles. In the four years prior, the SEC won the last four championships with two from Georgia, one from Alabama and one from LSU.</p>\n                <p>From 2020-22, the SEC went 22-15 in bowl games while the Big Ten went 15-13, showing that across the board the SEC not only won the national title, but reached bowl eligibility at a higher rate.</p>\n                <p>From 2023-24, the Big Ten was 17-10 while the SEC posted a 13-11 tally in the postseason.This season, the Big Ten went 11-5 in bowl games while SEC went 4-10. When the two conferences competed against each other, the Big Ten boasted a 3-1 record.</p>\n                <p>The SEC had five teams reach the College Football Playoff, while the Big Ten had three. The Big Ten had two teams with first-round byes in Indiana and Ohio State \u2014 the SEC had one in Georgia.</p>\n                <p>The success from the Big Ten is notable because of the differences in regular-season scheduling \u2014 the Big Ten played nine conference games while the SEC only played eight.</p>\n                <p>Indiana and Oregon became the final Big Ten teams remaining, with the Hoosiers beating the Ducks to punch their ticket to the title game. For the SEC, Ole Miss reached the College Football Playoff semifinal as well, but lost to the Hurricanes.</p>\n                <p>The SEC views playing each other as superior competition, which should benefit their strength of schedule, but in turn this isn\u2019t a reality, as its teams schedule nonconference opponents to essentially set up four free wins.</p>\n                <p>The one extra conference win in the Big Ten provides a tougher task than most of the nonconference schedules SEC teams have, and can be the difference-maker in SEC teams making it into the postseason with one less loss.</p>\n                <p>The aforementioned triumphs are part of the fact that college football\u2019s landscape has clearly changed. There\u2019s a significant amount of money that is being allocated across all conferences with NIL, and the transfer portal gives schools an opportunity to revamp their programs.</p>\n                <p>Still, Curt Cignetti shut down any idea of that helping the Hoosiers win the national title, saying postgame, \u201cour NIL is nowhere near where people think it is, so you can throw that out.\u201d But, he also hinted not so subtly that times are changing as far as who is the cream of the crop in the sport.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCollege football has changed quite a bit, the balance of power also,\u201d Cignetti said.</p>\n                <p>That comment also applies to Indiana as a whole, as the expectation is the Hoosiers\u2019 run won\u2019t be one of a storybook season. Instead, it\u2019ll be the start of continuous runs to the postseason and label as a year in, year out national title contender.</p>\n                <p>After all, the program went from the most all-time losses for power conference programs to winning a national championship in two seasons under Cignetti.</p>\n                <p>The mantra from the SEC is \u201cit just means more.\u201d It means that the play in the conference is above any other league in the country.</p>\n                <p>That phrase held true for a while. Now, it no longer means more. The SEC had its time on the throne, but there\u2019s been a change of power in college football.</p>\n                <p>The Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State\u2019s 2025 season left much to be desired considering the preseason expectations set for the Nittany Lions, but they did end the season on a four-game winning streak with a Pinstripe Bowl victory.</p>\n                <p>Along the way, some players struggled to meet their ceiling, while others blew past their projections en route to a 7-6 finish with Drew Allar suffering a season-ending injury and James Franklin being fired six games into the season.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s who I\u2019d hand out team awards to.</p>\n                <p>MVP and Offensive Player of the Year: Kaytron Allen, running back</p>\n                <p>Kaytron Allen was Penn State\u2019s engine on offense this season, earning All-Big Ten first-team honors after a year that saw him break the Nittany Lions\u2019 program record for career rushing yards.</p>\n                <p>Allen tallied 1,303 rushing yards in 12 games while averaging 6.2 yards per carry. He put up 195 more yards in 2025 compared to his 2024 year despite having 10 less carries and four less games to play in.</p>\n                <p>The senior began the season in a smaller role behind Nick Singleton despite outproducing his counterpart, but once interim head coach Terry Smith took over, Allen saw a spike in carries and continued his elite year.</p>\n                <p>Allen finished the year with three straight games of over 160 rushing yards, including a career-high 226 yards against Rutgers in the final regular season contest.</p>\n                <p>Defensive Player of the Year: Amare Campbell, linebacker</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s defense struggled mightily at different points of the year this season, but linebacker Amare Campbell consistently stood out as his position group struggled without Tony Rojas.</p>\n                <p>Campbell led the team with 103 tackles and 9.5 tackles for loss in his first and only year with the Nittany Lions. He started every game at the MIKE linebacker position for Penn State after transferring in from UNC, providing desperately needed help with thin depth in the room.</p>\n                <p>The Virginia native has since transferred to Tennessee, but Campbell was a major part of any success Penn State\u2019s defense had in 2025.</p>\n                <p>Freshman of the Year: Daryus Dixson, cornerback</p>\n                <p>There was plenty of freshman firepower on Penn State this season, but cornerback Daryus Dixson stood out among the pack.</p>\n                <p>Dixson appeared in every game this year, recording 24 tackles, six pass breakups, two tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble.</p>\n                <p>The freshman was one of just two players at the beginning of the year to earn a green light to burn his redshirt, and he started two games in 2025, including the Pinstripe Bowl win.</p>\n                <p>Most Improved Player: Andrew Rappleyea, tight end</p>\n                <p>A season-ending injury in 2024 derailed any chance for Andrew Rappleyea to have a breakout year, but he came back this year as the No. 3 tight end behind Khalil Dinkins and Luke Reynolds.</p>\n                <p>Rappleyea wound up making a name for himself and proved to be a must-retain player after a hot end to the year. The tight end had a touchdown in each of Penn State\u2019s last three games and finished with 180 yards across the season.</p>\n                <p>Assistant of the Year: Anthony Poindexter, safeties coach</p>\n                <p>Penn State\u2019s coaching staff left much to be desired this season, but Anthony Poindexter led safety Zakee Wheatley to the best year of his career and helped King Mack turn in a solid 2025.</p>\n                <p>Poindexter also called plays in the Pinstripe Bowl for the Nittany Lions, and the defense performed exceptionally well, allowing just 10 points to Clemson.</p>\n                <p>The Virginia alumnus won\u2019t be with Penn State next season as he embarks to Tennessee, but he finished his career in the blue and white with a great coaching campaign.</p>\n                <p>MORE FOOTBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "description": "<p>So, you\u2019re looking into therapy. Congratulations!</p>\n                <p>37% of students nationwide sought therapy or counseling in the past year, according to the 2024-2025 Healthy Minds Study. You\u2019re not alone.</p>\n                <p>Maybe you were one of those students, and you want to explore your options. If you\u2019re new here, maybe this was your New Year\u2019s resolution, you\u2019re finally getting off your parents\u2019 insurance, or like me when I started searching, you\u2019re tired.</p>\n                <p>Unfortunately, after you figure out all the financial nonsense and carve out some time, you\u2019re \u2026 at square one. There are so many options, but Pennsylvania (in January, no less) isn\u2019t exactly the mental health capital of the world, so selection can feel simultaneously limited and too broad.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, there are lots of things I\u2019ve noticed my peers don\u2019t know about the whole process, and as students, we don\u2019t often have time to hunt for insight online. But never fear: your resident columnist who\u2019s been through the wringer is back.</p>\n                <p>The first thing I\u2019ve noticed is that, although it\u2019s well-known that every therapist is different, therapy itself is still thought of and presented as monolithic and standardized, something that either works or doesn\u2019t.</p>\n                <p>That\u2019s not the case. There are different modalities and approaches to therapy, and each one might work for different conditions and preferences.</p>\n                <p>The modality you\u2019ve probably encountered, or will, is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. It\u2019s quite common and for me, it was basically what you think of when you hear \u201ctalk therapy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>CBT can be effective for coping with life events like grief and conditions like anxiety, phobias or Obsessive-compulsive disorder, just to name a few, and many people have great experiences.</p>\n                <p>However, I found it didn\u2019t work for me, which leads to my main point here: if a certain modality or approach doesn\u2019t work for you, you aren\u2019t broken or a failure.</p>\n                <p>Various factors can make an approach not fit, and even an adaptable provider who can use many different strategies within a modality can\u2019t make it work for you if it\u2019s not right.</p>\n                <p>In my experience, I found myself leaving even therapists I liked because it just \u2026 wasn\u2019t working. And during that time, I started to think therapy would never work for me.</p>\n                <p>Which, peace and love, sucked.</p>\n                <p>You deal with enough in these four years; you don\u2019t need to feel doomed on top of that.</p>\n                <p>But! The human brain is a complex organ, and so is the therapy world.</p>\n                <p>So, not only are there different types of talk therapy, there\u2019s also somatic therapy, which focuses on the body, music and art therapy and EMDR therapy, which focuses on eye movement to reprocess traumatic memories.</p>\n                <p>There are also subsets and variations to some modalities and approaches, and different therapists may use varying techniques to apply each one.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s no shame in bouncing around to find something you think might work for you.</p>\n                <p>Personally, my therapist uses Internal Family Systems, or IFS, which I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m still skeptical about.</p>\n                <p>Like, they asked me to close my eyes and take a deep breath once, and I all but gagged. But instead of getting offended, they asked me why, and I felt safe enough to tell them:</p>\n                <p>\u201cHonestly, [that request] feels like what people have said to me before insisting essential oils and meditation could cure my eczema. Not implying anything about you, just \u2026\u201d</p>\n                <p>To my surprise (because I was so sure I\u2019d accidentally insulted them), they said they understood why, based on my past, and were happy to send me scientific literature on IFS. And for the first time, I felt recognized as a whole person by a provider.</p>\n                <p>This leads me to my next point: you\u2019re allowed to be (healthily!) skeptical. Therapy isn\u2019t about blindly following someone else\u2019s opinion on how you should live your life, and self-advocacy throughout the process isn\u2019t tantamount to resisting treatment.</p>\n                <p>Honestly, I\u2019d say you should be a little skeptical. I mean, in a February 2025 article, the New York Times reported receiving over 2,700 responses after asking readers if they\u2019ve had any negative experiences with therapy.</p>\n                <p>Considering my own horror stories, I\u2019m not surprised, but Jee-zus. Needless to say, you're allowed to ask questions throughout the entire process, especially as you figure out what\u2019s right for you.</p>\n                <p>Not only can you ask about a therapist\u2019s treatment methods, but you can (and should!) ask about anything that\u2019s important to you and relevant to your treatment, like their approaches toward and professional comfort with identity, medication, clients with certain experiences or conditions and more.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting someone who gets you \u2014 and you\u2019re not alone in that desire. According to a 2017 study conducted by BARNA, 9% of US adults who sought therapy stated that finding a therapist who was similar to them was the most important factor in their search.</p>\n                <p>But if after a session (or a few), you\u2019re just not vibing? Well, a good provider wouldn\u2019t pressure you to work with them if you\u2019re not a good fit \u2014 or pressure you to do anything, for that matter.</p>\n                <p>And the people in your life shouldn\u2019t either.</p>\n                <p>There\u2019s a lot I could say about that, but your girl has a word count, so above all, I\u2019d like to emphasize that you define your healing.</p>\n                <p>Just like therapy doesn\u2019t look any one way, neither does growth, and you can\u2019t hold yourself to anyone else\u2019s standards.</p>\n                <p>So, sorry, but your parent who wants you to stop disagreeing with them, your friends who want you to be less of an introvert and your boss who wants you to enjoy working until 2 a.m. might all end up sorely disappointed after your intake session.</p>\n                <p>The most important question is this: Will you?</p>\n                <p>MORE COLUMNS</p>",

    "author": "Myles Hannak | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Per a new tradition, Penn State will return to its last venue before the Bryce Jordan Center, Rec Hall, to face the Wisconsin Badgers.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers arrive off a dominant 13-5 record, while the Nittany Lions sit at an even 9-9.</p>\n                <p>Beyond those records, the tale of the tape begins to tell a very different narrative between the squads.</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall rebounding</p>\n                <p>This occasion marks the third consecutive year the Nittany Lions have hosted the promotion, with an even record in both games.</p>\n                <p>Home turf remains a fortress for Penn State this season, as it holds the third-highest home rating in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>Last season, it received an 83-64 thumping at the hands of rival Ohio State, and most of the stat figures went the Buckeyes\u2019 way, especially rebounding, where they held a 41-23 advantage.</p>\n                <p>Although in the inaugural \u201cReturn to the Rec\u201d in 2024, results went differently, Penn State upset No. 12 Illinois in a 90-89 nail-biter, yet the trend of opposition domination on the glass continued, as the Fighting Illini posted a 49-25 rebounding advantage.</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall rebounding looks to go to a foe for a third straight season, as Wisconsin tied for eighth in the conference, while the Nittany Lions sit dead last in the Big Ten in rebounding per game.</p>\n                <p>Badgers\u2019 7-footer Nolan Winter leads the approach on the glass with 8.7 rebounds per game, a top-five figure, while his defensive rebounding stands only second in the Big Ten to standout Washington forward Hannes Steinbach.</p>\n                <p>Wondrous Wisconsin</p>\n                <p>The Badgers arrive in Happy Valley with possibly their best streak of basketball played this season, as they ride a four game win streak. Over the last ten outings, Wisconsin holds a 7-3 record, with two losses to the top two Big Ten teams, Nebraska and Purdue, and an overtime defeat to Villanova.</p>\n                <p>Form favors the Badgers, and the results came against both top and bottom-level performers, indicating that Wisconsin isn\u2019t one to play down to opponents. Wisconsin\u2019s best result came three games ago on Jan. 10 when it upset No. 2 Michigan 91-88 to give the Wolverines their first loss of the year.</p>\n                <p>The Badgers shot under 40% only three times this year, and recently those offensive woes haven\u2019t persisted: they shot over 40% from beyond the arc in their last three games. The defense for Wisconsin remained solid over this stretch, although it can be susceptible to allowing opponents to break expected scoring averages.</p>\n                <p>Scoring stars</p>\n                <p>Wisconsin enters Rec Hall with the fourth-highest scoring total offense in the Big Ten, but also has the fourth-most points allowed.</p>\n                <p>Leading the Badgers' offensive effort is a pair of top-ten conference scorers, Nick Boyd and John Blackwell, who are comfortable scoring both inside and beyond the arc.</p>\n                <p>Blackwell is prone to hit or miss outings, as he has the lowest field goal percentage out of all top-15 conference scorers. However, the Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, native logged a tied Big Ten second-best single-game scoring mark this season, with his 31 points against Campbell in November.</p>\n                <p>Penn State also faced Campbell, and while it couldn't match the dominant fashion of Wisconsin's 96-64 win, it also saw a single-game stardom from its own guard, as Kayden Mingo scored 21 points in an 87-76 win.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions return to Rec Hall with full offensive strength, as both players listed as questionable before the last game, Mingo and Freddie Dilione V, who lead Penn State in scoring, both appeared in its last contest. Dilione may see load management, however, as an ankle injury suffered against UCLA continues to nag him.</p>\n                <p>Against the Camels, three Penn State players joined Mingo in scoring more than 15 points, while only Boyd and Winter joined Blackwell in the Badgers meeting against Campbell in reaching such a feat.</p>\n                <p>Tempo in this one should be a big factor, as both Penn State and Wisconsin rank inside the top half in the Big Ten for Evan Miyakawa\u2019s tempo rating.</p>\n                <p>Don\u2019t expect great defensive teams either, as the Badgers rank the sixth worst in the conference, while the blue and white sit at the bottom, with the only negative team defensive rating in the Big Ten.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL CONTENT</p>",

    "author": "Noah Aberegg | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Players sat around the locker room in anticipation on Selection Sunday, waiting to hear their name called for the fourth straight year.</p>\n                <p>These moments defined coach Kayla Treanor\u2019s four seasons at Syracuse, leading her team to a 59-24 record. After being named the next Penn State women\u2019s lacrosse coach in May 2025, Treanor will have an opportunity to do the same in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThat drive to be a national championship team will never change for her,\u201d Julia Basciano, a midfielder under Treanor at Syracuse and now at Penn State, told The Daily Collegian. \u201cThat is always going to be the expectation and the standard for her.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Treanor\u2019s championship drive started long before her time coaching Penn State, Syracuse and Boston College. The Niskayuna, New York, native became a star with the Orange as a player, becoming one of the most decorated women\u2019s lacrosse players of all time.</p>\n                <p>Under the player leadership of Treanor, Syracuse experienced four straight championship weekends, including a spot in the 2014 NCAA title game.</p>\n                <p>During that stretch, she became the program\u2019s only four-time IWLCA All-American, a three-time Tewaaraton Award finalist and Syracuse\u2019s all-time leading scorer.</p>\n                <p>\u201cShe\u2019s just really inspiring from the player that she was in college throughout her whole entire career,\u201d Basciano said. \u201cShe steps out onto the field every day to coach us and motivate us, and she\u2019s very humble about her career. Little does she know that she is an inspiration to probably every single person on our team.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Following her time at Syracuse, Treanor spent time with the U.S. women\u2019s lacrosse team, quickly becoming the team\u2019s all-time leader in points and goals. With Team USA, Treanor won gold at the 2017 and 2022 World Championships before retiring and picking up her coaching career at Harvard and Boston College. She ultimately returned to her alma mater in 2022.</p>\n                <p>\u201cMy coaching philosophy has changed so much,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cI\u2019ve had really great experiences (at each school) and learned that all the players are so different, so it\u2019s always coming in and trying to understand your players and your team and how they learn best.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Despite only spending four years with Syracuse, Treanor capitalized on every season with tournament appearances in each of the four years and semifinal appearances in 2023 and 2024.</p>\n                <p>After falling in the second round of the 2025 NCAA Tournament, Penn State vice president of Intercollegiate Athletics Pat Kraft reached out to Treanor about filling the position left by former coach Missy Doherty. The pair already had a connection from their time at Boston College, and Kraft hoped to rekindle that relationship in Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIn full transparency, I never thought I was leaving Syracuse,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just an opportunity that I absolutely could not pass up. This is such an incredible school, amazing administration and amazing team and players with rich history and success and tradition.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While many teams experience roster turnover following coaching changes, the Nittany Lions held fairly steady, knowing they were getting a high-caliber coach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe always spoke about having a championship culture, but this year, you can actually feel it,\u201d senior attacker Erika Ho told the Collegian. \u201cEveryone has a different drive this year, and that\u2019s kudos to Kayla and the rest of the staff for making and creating a winning culture.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Part of that championship culture comes with Treanor\u2019s coaching philosophy of empowering each individual player and building team passion.</p>\n                <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s obsessed with Curt Cignetti right now because he\u2019s an amazing coach and talks so much about one play at a time, and every play is the same and every game is the same,\u201d Treanor said, referencing Indiana football\u2019s national championship-winning head coach. \u201cNothing is too special or too big of a moment for their team, and I think it's similar to my philosophy.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Treanor\u2019s philosophy and championship pedigree have resonated not only with the returners at Penn State but also with transfers, including Basciano, who followed her to Happy Valley.</p>\n                <p>\u201cCoach Treanor is just an amazing person as well as an amazing, amazing coach,\u201d Basciano said. \u201cThere really is no other person that I would want to be coached by.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Outside of Treanor\u2019s coaching style and work on the field, her compassion and care for her athletes have been just another thing that motivated the team to play for her.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can tell her, and the entire staff just deeply cares about you, both as a person and a lacrosse player,\u201d Ho said. \u201cBeing around the staff, I feel like I\u2019m a better person, and I think I\u2019ve learned so much in only a few short months being under them.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While this kindness and compassion from Treanor and the entire coaching staff have made the team feel welcome, the same has been felt by Treanor as she\u2019s gotten to know her Penn State team after a few months.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTo be honest, I think this is one of my favorite teams I've ever coached,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cI'm just looking forward to continuing to develop my relationships with players and just continue to get to know them, because they are really a special group.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Included in those feelings toward the team is that championship-level pedigree she brings to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Despite never winning the big game, Treanor has the expectations each and every year to be playing for a spot to win a national championship. If she is successful with the Nittany Lions, it will be their first title since 1989.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWhat excites me the most is just how much they care,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt really means so much to me, just seeing how much work they put in, how much they genuinely care about each and every one of us and how much they care and want to be a winning program.\u201d</p>\n                <p>While it has been nearly 40 years since Penn State\u2019s spot in the history books, Treanor believes that Penn State can make it back and be one of the best programs in the country.</p>\n                <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a no-brainer,\u201d Treanor said. \u201cThis is a place where we can win national championships and be one of the Blue Bloods of college lacrosse.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE LACROSSE COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Andrew Mercer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>The Nittany Lions lost many major contributors on the offensive side of the field at the conclusion of the 2025 season, when Cornell defeated Penn State <a href=\"http://rts/men_lacrosse/penn-state-men-s-lacrosse-falls-short-of-comeback-against-cornell-in-ncaa-tournament-semifinals/article_b375962b-7d84-4ca0-888b-680544b9ce6b.html\" target=\"_blank\">in the NCAA National Semifinal at Gillette Stadium</a>. However, the same can\u2019t be said about the defensive squadron.</p>\n                <p>Former Nittany Lion \u2014 and current member of the Denver Outlaws of the PLL \u2014 Kevin Parnham was a considerable loss for the defense. Despite losing their previous captain, the Nittany Lions returned a veteran group of poles in attempts to make another run at the national title.</p>\n                <p>Defensemen</p>\n                <p>The two biggest returners to the down-low defensive lineup are Alex Ross and Will Costin.</p>\n                <p>Ross, a senior from Davidsonville, Maryland, recorded a career-high 31 ground balls through 17 games in 2025, also forcing 24 turnovers. While it isn\u2019t common for defensemen to have offensive presence, Ross scored his first and only career goal against the Big Red on March 8, helping propel a 13-12 comeback victory.</p>\n                <p>Speaking of defenders who\u2019ve produced points, Costin registered a goal and two assists last season. He tallied a goal in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, where the blue and white defeated Colgate, 13-11. His pair of assists were spread out; the first was notched in the season opener against the Raiders and Costin registered his second in the national semifinal.</p>\n                <p>Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions also return senior Max Grube, junior Dillon Torggler, redshirt sophomore Patrick Keenan and redshirt freshman Brad Piffath.</p>\n                <p>Keenan, a Springfield, Pennsylvania, native, appeared in 10 games last season and picked up three ground balls. Grube and Torggler added depth on the bench, each playing in two games. Piffath only appeared in a single game in 2025.</p>\n                <p>In the offseason, Penn State recruited a trio of four-star freshmen defenders.</p>\n                <p>Luke Marra, a 6-foot-1 long pole out of Ridgewood, New Jersey, was ranked the No. 73 prospect in the Class of 2025, according to Inside Lacrosse. Marra played club lacrosse for Building Blocks Lacrosse Elite Black, going 24-16 in 2024.</p>\n                <p>That same publication ranked teammate Paul Bruder, who stands at 5-foot-11, as the No. 94 prospect in the Class of 2025. He previously played for the Episcopal Academy and Team Ten for club.</p>\n                <p>Mark McNamara, a towering 6-foot-5 presence, joins the list of incoming defensive depth and hails from Darien, Connecticut.</p>\n                <p>Long-stick midfielders</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions retained their top two long-stick midfielders in senior Ryan O\u2019Connor and sophomore Lucca DiBartolomeo, while adding three new additions to the youthful depth chart.</p>\n                <p>O\u2019Connor has been a staple of Penn State\u2019s lineup since his freshman campaign in 2023, primarily with his quick retrieval of faceoffs from the wing. In his first season as a Nittany Lion, he scored a goal and picked up 22 ground balls. Last year, he tallied two assists early in the season and scooped a career-high 35 ground balls in 17 games.</p>\n                <p>DiBartolomeo also appeared in all 17 games, registering 21 ground balls and forced seven turnovers.</p>\n                <p>Originally committed to Navy in 2022, four-star recruit Jake Anzelone flipped to Penn State in March. Despite finishing out his high school career with the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Rhode Island, Anzelone played three years with his hometown Seaford Senior High School in New York.</p>\n                <p>Billy Henderson is yet another four-star recruit by Inside Lacrosse. A Springfield, Pennsylvania, native, he committed to Penn State in Sept. 2023. Aharon Bloshuk is the lone three-star recruit from Bangor, Pennsylvania.

    "description": "<p>Penn State men\u2019s basketball endured a tumultuous start to the year, yet its alums, who\u2019ve moved on to bigger things, created a new narrative for the program.</p>\n                <p>Yanic Konan Niederh\u00e4user, center, Los Angeles Clippers</p>\n                <p>The rookie year for former Penn State center Yanic Konan Niederh\u00e4user has gone about as expected in the NBA, as he\u2019s excelled but only in limited minutes.</p>\n                <p>On Jan. 14, the Fraschels, Switzerland, native tied his career high, matching his 16 point game logged at the end of 2025. Yet in his recent outing against the Washington Wizards, didn\u2019t miss a shot as he outplayed former 2024 No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr in the process.</p>\n                <p>The rookie played the next game against the Raptors, and scored five points, all from the charity stripe, but as starting big man Ivica Zuba\u0107 returned to action after injury, Niderh\u00e4user saw his minutes decrease.</p>\n                <p>In the Clippers' recent game, where they again faced the Wizards, Niederh\u00e4user didn\u2019t appear, as Los Angeles returned to full strength. Brook Lopez bumped him in the rotation, as the veteran shoots the lowest field goal percentage of his career.</p>\n                <p>With Lopez's scoring struggles, he and Zuba\u0107 are also two of the least efficient pick-and-roll big men, and as the former Nittany Lion begins to blossom, it isn\u2019t far-fetched to envision a larger role.</p>\n                <p>Jalen Pickett, guard, Denver Nuggets</p>\n                <p>Since Jalen Pickett earned his first start of the season, he\u2019s posted solid outings for the Denver Nuggets and emerged as a solid piece. The Rochester, New York, native started in the last five outings for the Nuggets, and they\u2019ve won four of those contests.</p>\n                <p>In three of those games, Pickett notched double-digit scoring, and in the only loss over that stretch, he potentially put up his best game since his 29-point outing on Jan 5.</p>\n                <p>In the latest game on Jan. 18 against the Chicago Bulls, the Nuggets lost 110-87, yet Pickett had the best plus-minus rating of any Denver starter, behind his 12 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds.</p>\n                <p>After Pickett\u2019s stretch of receiving more playing time, his averages increased to 6.2 points per game, 2.7 rebounds per game, 2.6 assists per game and 46.2% from the field, and he hasn\u2019t missed a free throw all year.</p>\n                <p>Andrew Jones, coach, Toronto 905</p>\n                <p>The lone member of the list not in the NBA or a player, Andrew Jones III, posted the most impressive year of any Penn State alum.</p>\n                <p>The former Nittany Lions forward played in Happy Valley from 2007 to 2011, making 134 appearances during that tenure, though Jones later pivoted to a coaching role.</p>\n                <p>The Philadelphia native had stints as a staff member with the Oklahoma City Thunder, his hometown 76ers, the Detroit Pistons and the Toronto Raptors. In June 2024, he earned his first head coaching gig with Toronto\u2019s G League affiliate, the 905 Raptors.</p>\n                <p>This season, Jones\u2019 squad emerged as a buzzsaw in the G League, posting the best record at 10-2. His squad holds a 14.4-point differential at the start of the year; the next-highest team in the league posts only a 7.9 differential.</p>\n                <p><a href=\"https://www.psucollegian.com/sports/men_basketball/ex-penn-state-forward-andrew-jones-iii-named-nba-g-league-coach-of-the-month/article_73394251-27bb-48d0-a9e7-f88331f3cbec.html\" target=\"_blank\">In the month of December, Jones earned honors as the top G-League Coach of the Month.</a></p>\n                <p>Jones created a solid squad performance, with many contributors, but his gem has been the development of rookie Chucky Hepburn, the 2025 ACC Defensive Player of the Year. Hepburn posts top-five per-game figures in assists and steals, as under Jones\u2019 tutelage, he\u2019s seen a breakout.</p>\n                <p>As a squad, the Raptors shoot the best field goal percentage in the G-League and rank in the top three in steals and three-point percentage, emerging as a real contender to win the championship.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "title": "Penn State notebook | Cael Sanderson talks Rocco Welsh, program's success",
    "author": "Evan Smith | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Following a dominating performance against Iowa and Northwestern last weekend, Penn State faces Indiana and Maryland in their final two-dual weekend of the season.</p>\n                <p>Prior to the upcoming matchups, Cael Sanderson met with the media to discuss how the Penn State wrestling program has seemingly lapped the competition while approaching an 80-match winning streak.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what he had to say.</p>\n                <p>No closing the gap</p>\n                <p>After dropping nine out of their last 10 matches to Penn State, Hawkeyes\u2019 coach Tom Brands commented on how they\u2019ve never been beaten like that. The loss was a metaphor for how Penn State has separated from the pack of elite wrestling programs. Sanderson offered insight for why he believes the program has sustained such dominance.</p>\n                <p>In a changing landscape of wrestling, featuring NIL and high schoolers reclassifying to join the college ranks early, Sanderson focuses on recruits joining Penn State \u201cfor the right reasons,\u201d rather than just searching for a paycheck.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOur kids know that they are coming here to become the best wrestler they can possibly be,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cKids are coming here, with very high character, wanting to be the best wrestlers in the world.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Sanderson drove home the sentiment, saying that top recruits and their families know Penn State will drive its team to be the best both on and off the mat. He wants that to be the factor that drives commitments, rather than other motivations.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe do our best to follow the rules,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cSo although (the NIL era) seems like an advantage for others, I think it\u2019ll be an advantage for us.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Team chemistry</p>\n                <p>One benefit of recruiting the high-quality characters Sanderson spoke about is developing a locker room culture that he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d He credits the roster as well as the long-term chemistry developed by the program over the last decade plus. Sanderson further credits the families of the wrestlers for raising them into men that make the team as bonded as they are.</p>\n                <p>\u201cJust a lot of good kids that could have named their price at another but are here because of what the program stands for,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>During the Iowa dual, the Nittany Lions\u2019 bench was shown throughout the match supporting their teammates inside a volatile Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Sanderson acknowledged his team\u2019s \u201cbigger than yourself\u201d mentality and genuine support for each other. Sanderson concluded by saying that coaching \u201cwouldn\u2019t be fun\u201d without a team like Penn State.</p>\n                <p>New starters</p>\n                <p>Marcus Blaze, PJ Duke and Cole Mirasola all picked up marquee victories over the weekend. Forgoing the usual talk after performances like theirs, Sanderson focused on each wrestler\u2019s character rather than technical ability.</p>\n                <p>Sanderson credited the trio as being able to be themselves when they wrestle and being elite competitors. All three wrestled opponents they can expect to see late in the NCAA tournament, on the biggest stage they\u2019ve wrestled on in their collegiate career and maintained composure.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThe bigger the moment, the better they\u2019re going to wrestle,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019ve done their whole lives and what we do as a program.\u201d</p>\n                <p>For Mirasola, Sanderson dove in on his toughness and training. After Josh Barr described Mirasola as \u201cnasty\u201d during a press conference, Sanderson clarified that Mirasola can bring out an animalistic side when the whistle blows, while remaining a good person and wrestling within the rules. Sanderson said it boils down to Mirasola having to fight for everything he\u2019s earned to this point.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been a great athlete that didn\u2019t have to fight for things,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>He also dove deep on Mirasola\u2019s training, crediting Lucas Cochran for his relationship with his weight-class partner, as well as former Nittany Lion Greg Kerkvliet and \u201cthe heavyweight tamer\u201d in assistant coach Casey Cunningham for their roles in developing the redshirt freshman.</p>\n                <p>Despite the praise, Sanderson doesn\u2019t expect his wrestlers to get complacent, especially after just a dual victory. His focus is keeping the roster focused on the future, improvement and larger accolades later in the season.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s patting themselves on the back or anything,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cAs much as seeing what we can do better.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rocco Welsh</p>\n                <p>After his tiebreaker victory over the former No. 1 Angelo Ferrari, Rocco Welsh staked his claim at the top of a loaded 184-pound weight class. Sanderson spoke about his time recruiting Welsh out of Pennsylvania prior to college and seeing his potential. The coach specifically acknowledged his ability to listen, his preparation and his toughness.</p>\n                <p>However, Sanderson didn\u2019t speak too deeply into the victory itself, focusing on the next steps as he always does when asked about Welsh\u2019s No. 1 status.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t win Nationals in January,\u201d Sanderson said.</p>\n                <p>MORE WRESTLING COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Daniel Studer | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>After remaining at No. 4 in the USCHO poll for another week, the Nittany Lions concluded their seven-game road trip against the twelfth-ranked Cornell Big Red as they finished their home-and-home series of the 2025-26 season.</p>\n                <p>The blue-and-white did so without its lone goalscorer from their game against Cornell just before the end of the 2025 calendar year, Matilde Fantin. Fantin was recently named to Italy\u2019s Women\u2019s Hockey team for the 2026 Winter Olympics, joining fellow Olympians Tessa Janecke (United States) and Nicole Hall (Sweden).</p>\n                <p>However, what Penn State lost in Fantin, it gained in goaltender Katie DeSa, who made her first start since Jan. 2 when she left after the second period with an injury in Penn State\u2019s 5-1 loss to Ohio State. DeSa shutout the Big Red in December\u2019s contest, the 20th of her career, tying her with Josie Bothun (\u201824) for the most in program history.</p>\n                <p>DeSa performed to her standard, leading the Nittany Lions to a 5-1 win in a mid-week matchup in the final non-conference game of the season.</p>\n                <p>The senior netminder extended her shutout streak against Cornell to four periods after blanking them in the opening frame, stopping all eight shots she faced. She passed the first test she faced with ease, turning away multiple one-timers on a Cornell power play after the officials assessed Leah Stecker for a minor cross-checking penalty.</p>\n                <p>Penn State struck first with a goal off the stick of Janecke, her 17th of the season. Katelyn Roberts battled Cornell\u2019s Nora Curtis for the puck along the boards, ultimately forcing a turnover in Penn State\u2019s offensive zone. Janecke was able to pick up the loose puck and score on a shot from the faceoff dot to the right of the Big Red goaltender Annelies Bergmann.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions captain extended her point streak to six games with goals in each of the last four. Janecke extended her AHA goal-scoring lead and entered a tie for the sixth most in the nation with three other skaters.</p>\n                <p>Cornell was able to regroup during the first intermission and didn\u2019t waste any time in the second period, evening things at 1-1 just shy of 90 seconds into the period. The Big Red\u2019s Shannon Pearson picked up the puck in the neutral zone and entered her offensive zone in a 2-on-2 situation and beat DeSa under the blocker from the slot for her third goal of the season.</p>\n                <p>Just moments later, the carnelian-and-white took advantage of another Nittany Lion defensive collapse when Avi Adam entered the zone on a breakaway. Yet a diving attempt from Abby Stonehouse forced Adam to quickly recover and shoot, missing wide of the net.</p>\n                <p>After a series of multiple icing calls against the blue-and-white, Janecke circled back into her own zone and led a rush the other way and dumped the puck into the Cornell zone. Taya MacDonald was able to stop a clearing attempt from leaving the zone and found Maddy Christian coming up the boards, who received the pass, turned and ripped a shot that was deflected in front by Grace Outwater to give Penn State its second lead of the game, 2-1.</p>\n                <p>Outwater has now scored in three straight games and totaled 16 on the season, matching her career-high from last season in 15 fewer games. Her 27 points on the season set a new career-high for the sophomore winger.</p>\n                <p>With just over six minutes remaining in the second period, Cornell nearly knotted the score again, but a pass sent too wide left the Big Red looking for another opportunity.</p>\n                <p>They wouldn\u2019t see it in the second period as the blue-and-white continued to keep its foot on the gas with Christian leading the way, but came up short after being denied by Bergmann on two scoring opportunities.</p>\n                <p>After struggling to exit their own zone in the second, the third-period Nittany Lions continued to build momentum and controlled the puck well, maintaining possession in the Cornell zone. Roberts chipped the puck up to Janecke, who dished a cross-ice pass to a wide-open Stonehouse, who tapped in her sixth goal of the season with ease.</p>\n                <p>Penn State continued its dominance in the first half of the final period, outshooting Cornell 6-1 with its lone shot-on-goal coming on the second unsuccessful man-advantage of the night.</p>\n                <p>Continuing to challenge Bergmann from the middle of the slot between the two faceoff circles, Sophie Morrow extended the Nittany Lions\u2019 lead to three with her third goal of the season. With an assist from Kendall Butze, the Penn State defense remains one of the best in the country, breaking a tie for second in defensive scoring.</p>\n                <p>After being denied multiple times at the end of the second period, Christian netted her 14th goal of the season with no challenge on an empty-net goal.</p>\n                <p>With this win, Penn State finishes its non-conference play with a record of 7-3. Overall, Penn State improved its record to 22-4, giving the Nittany Lions the most wins in the nation.</p>\n                <p>Up Next</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions will return home to Pegula Ice Arena, where they will host the Delaware Blue Hens for a weekend series beginning on Friday at 6 p.m.</p>\n                <p>MORE WOMEN'S HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

But its recent success came at a cost.</p>\n                <p>Charlie Cerrato and Braeden Ford exited with injuries against the Golden Gophers and didn\u2019t play against Notre Dame. Gadowsky said last week that Ford will miss \u201ca significant amount of time\u201d and labeled Cerrato as \u201cday-to-day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Gadowsky was hesitant to provide an update on Cerrato, the team\u2019s co-assist leader, before he labeled him \u201cdoubtful\u201d for this weekend\u2019s series against the Badgers.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI\u2019m not 100% confident in giving you an update, but (Cerrato is) doubtful for this weekend,\u201d Gadowsky said.</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions had so many injuries at forward entering last weekend\u2019s series that they didn\u2019t list a fourth-line right winger for Game 1 and omitted an extra skater from their lineup sheet in Game 2.</p>\n                <p>Mac Gadowsky, who exited Friday\u2019s victory after taking a hard hit along the boards and missed Saturday\u2019s contest, Shea Van Olm and Casey Aman are \u201cday-to-day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Goaltending plans</p>\n                <p>Penn State has used a goaltending tandem between Fleming and Kevin Reidler in 10 of its 11 series this season. And through 22 games, both rank inside the top six in goals-against average and save percentage among Big Ten goalies \u2014 a key reason Gadowsky\u2019s waited to name a true starter.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI believe we're going to continue (both goaltenders) because it seems to be working very well,\u201d Gadowsky said. What we like most is that the goaltending trio supports each other. They're a great example of what teamwork is.\u201d</p>\n                <p>But Fleming has separated from his counterpart since the start of Big Ten play.</p>\n                <p>In 10 starts, the freshman netminder sports a 1.82 goals-against average, which far outpaces Reidler\u2019s 2.92, and a conference-best 94.3 save percentage. He has stopped 86 of the 88 shots he\u2019s faced in his three starts since the international break.</p>\n                <p>Despite Fleming\u2019s impressive production, Gadowsky declined Tuesday to name him the starter, instead praising the success of the tandem.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have a good thing going on right now, and I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but right now, (the goaltending tandem) is one thing that's really going well. I don't know why we try to fix something that's not broken.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Blocking the noise</p>\n                <p>The outside noise has been loud surrounding McKenna, the consensus No. 1 pick in the 2026 NHL Entry Draft. That wasn\u2019t a surprise.</p>\n                <p>But the way he\u2019s handled that pressure earned praise from his head coach.</p>\n                <p>\u201cOne of the things that I admire most about (McKenna) is that he really doesn't listen to the noise, and he has a confidence about him, regardless of what some people say on some website,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cI admire his internal compass. He\u2019s really been raised well by his family, by his community, to stay level-headed and worry about what he controls.\u201d</p>\n                <p>McKenna tallied his first multi-goal game in Penn State\u2019s 6-3 victory over Notre Dame last Saturday. His offensive output has ballooned since his return from international play, which left Gadowsky more impressed than surprised.</p>\n                <p>\u201cYou look at the World Junior Championships, (McKenna) was one point from the lead and just turned 18,\u201d Gadowsky said. He\u2019s doing incredibly well, and we see him getting better every day.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE HOCKEY COVERAGE</p>",

    "description": "<p>Penn State is on an eight-game losing streak.</p>\n                <p>With no answers over the past month, the Lady Lions will look for a miracle as they hit the West Coast for a pair of games against Washington and Oregon at 9 p.m. Wednesday and 5 p.m. Saturday.</p>\n                <p>Penn State enters off a disappointing four-point loss to Rutgers, which earned its first conference win of the season on Sunday. Now, the Lady Lions will hunt for their own, starting with the No. 25-ranked Huskies.</p>\n                <p>Washington</p>\n                <p>Washington experienced on-and-off success this year, winning games against Utah and then-No. 6 Michigan. However, it lost to struggling Purdue earlier in January.</p>\n                <p>Both Penn State and the Huskies have a strong trio that contributes to most of their team\u2019s scoring. For Washington, it\u2019s three guards, and for Penn State, two guards and a center.</p>\n                <p>Sayvia Sellers leads the Huskies from the court through 18 games, scoring 18.4 points per game.</p>\n                <p>For the first month, it was just Sellers and Avery Howell, who averaged 12.8 points per game. But for the past month-and-a-half, senior Elle Ladine entered the mix after coming back from an injury in November.</p>\n                <p>Together, the three have combined for 42.3 points per game and over three steals per game.</p>\n                <p>The Lady Lions, however, have 6-foot-6 Gracie Merkle, who has been the most efficient player in the country. Through 11 weeks, Merkle has averaged nearly 75% shooting from the court, scoring 19.3 points per game.</p>\n                <p>To go along with Merkle\u2019s power in the paint has been shifty Kiyomi McMiller, who\u2019s averaged 19.4 points per game.</p>\n                <p>Rounding out Penn State\u2019s big three is redshirt junior Moriah Murray, who has the second-most made 3-pointers in the Big Ten this season, making 55 triples.</p>\n                <p>With a star-studded trio in both lineups, Wednesday\u2019s matchup will likely come down to which team can get better opportunities from the bench.</p>\n                <p>Oregon</p>\n                <p>While Saturday\u2019s matchup won\u2019t be another top-25 matchup for the Lady Lions, it will be another contest against a premier Big Ten team who\u2019s had big wins this season.</p>\n                <p>Sitting at 14-6, Oregon had its fair share of celebrations this year with wins against then-No. 21 USC, Oregon State and Auburn. However, it\u2019s on its own losing streak with three straight losses to Michigan State, Iowa and Wisconsin.</p>\n                <p>While Penn State searches for its first win since December 20th \u2014 losing eight straight \u2014 the Ducks have more recent victories they can still garner momentum from.</p>\n                <p>Oregon\u2019s defense will be the biggest struggle for the Lady Lions, recording 11.8 steals per game.</p>\n                <p>Despite scoring just 6.1 and 7.4 points per game, Oregon\u2019s Ari Long and Sofia Bell have started all a majority of games this year, mainly due to their defensive toughness. The two currently rank in seventh and 15th in the conference in steals per game, combining for 73 total this season.</p>\n                <p>The Ducks\u2019 offense, however, comes from another pair of Oregon stars in Katie Fiso and Mia Jacobs.</p>\n                <p>Fiso has shot 49.2% from the court en route to 15.7 points per game, while Jacobs is tied for sixth in the Big Ten in made 3-pointers with 44.</p>\n                <p>If the two Ducks continue to perform at the top of their games, and Oregon\u2019s defense puts pressure on Penn State \u2014 a team that averages a conference-high 19.6 turnovers per game \u2014 Saturday\u2019s contest could be another \u201cL\u201d in the books for the Lady Lions.</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

    "author": "Will Horstman | The Daily Collegian",
    "description": "<p>Penn State remained winless in Big Ten play after a 96-73 loss to Maryland this weekend, and Mike Rhoades returned to the podium for his weekly press conference on Tuesday.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades spoke on what goes into building a program, the morale of his team amid its losing streak and more as the schedule continues with a home game against Wisconsin on Thursday.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s what Rhoades had to say.</p>\n                <p>Building a program</p>\n                <p>Indiana won a national championship in football on Monday night after never having much success in the sport. Prior to the Hoosiers\u2019 recent run, comparisons could\u2019ve been made between Penn State men\u2019s basketball and Indiana football as both weren\u2019t known as consistent winning programs.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said he\u2019s watched the Hoosiers\u2019 turnaround in football under head coach Curt Cignetti closely, saying he tried to learn their approach of bringing potential sustainable success to a program.</p>\n                <p>\u201cI think their organization, their commitment, the decisions they've made to be able to go to bat in the big boy batter's box has paid a dividend for them and put them in the position that they're in,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSo it's a lot of decisions, a lot of conversations you got to have, and then you got to go do it, and they did it, pretty impressive.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said recruiting and retention of high-level players is one aspect in particular he thinks can expedite building a program. Penn State has freshman guard Kayden Mingo, who is the highest-rated recruit in program history.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe're recruiting high-level dudes. We got to get them. We got to retain them,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThe ones we have in our program that want to be here and do it the right way. We got to retain them. This is hard, and when you're losing everyone has answers or questions and all that stuff, but they're not in the building with us every day as we're trying to do this the right way and build it the right way.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are a finalist for 5-star 2026 guard Dylan Mingo, who ranks as the No. 5 player nationally by the 247Sports composite. Rhoades was asked if he thinks Penn State is currently in a position to land the highest levels of talent out of high school.</p>\n                <p>\u201cNot yet, but I have belief that we will, and we're moving forward,\u201d Rhoades said.</p>\n                <p>Morale of team</p>\n                <p>Penn State has lost its last five games and eight of its last nine matchups. The losing skid has included blowout losses and close contests that saw the Nittany Lions nearly pulling off upsets.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said the players are still working to get their first win in the Big Ten slate and have been coachable.</p>\n                <p>\u201cTo give them the respect I have for them and the way they're handling,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cI mean, guys are disappointed and upset, but we don't have issues off the court or things that are getting in the way of what we're trying to do.\u201d</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions haven\u2019t won since a 90-67 victory over NC Central on Dec. 29, and they haven\u2019t beaten a power-conference opponent this year, as all nine of their wins came against. Quad 4 teams.</p>\n                <p>Still, Penn State\u2019s roster, which has eight freshmen, is impressing Rhoades in still putting in effort despite the season being off to a rough start.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe have some young guys that are in big positions that a lot's on them, but win or lose, whatever the scenario is, if you keep learning from it, it's going to make you better,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIt's just hard. I mean, come on, it is where we are, but I've been proud of the guys for their response, especially with the morale.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Puff Johnson playing for Ohio State</p>\n                <p>Former Penn State forward Puff Johnson, who has already played in five seasons of collegiate basketball, transferred to Ohio State in the fall and was given a temporary retraining order, making him immediately eligible to play.</p>\n                <p>Rhoades spoke on the possibility of Johnson playing for the Nittany Lions this year, but it didn\u2019t work out.</p>\n                <p>\u201cPuff and I spoke about that, and we knew we were going to have a scholarship,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cSo if he was eligible to come back, he had a scholarship. That changes with (revenue) share and NIL because we're not in a position where we can just lose money and all that stuff \u2026 We all moved on in a positive way without a doubt. He's a Penn State grad, and he gave us everything for two years. I really appreciate (him). He's a good kid.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rec Hall game</p>\n                <p>The Nittany Lions are set to host Wisconsin inside Rec Hall at 7 p.m. Thursday. It\u2019ll be a change from the usual site of the Bryce Jordan Center, bringing back an old-school look.</p>\n                <p>\u201cWe all love a little throwback in us, right?\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cIt's an old arena. It's an old gym. People are on top of you now with the new court and the way it's configured, even more on top of you. I just think it's cool. Penn Staters love something different. I think sometimes being different and doing something cool like that is fun, fun for everybody.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Prior to the Bryce Jordan Center opening, Penn State used to host its home games in Rec Hall from 1929-96, holding a record of 514-183. Rec Hall has a listed capacity of 6,846, and with bleachers close to the court, the atmosphere sounds louder than the typical game at the Bryce Jordan Center.</p>\n                <p>Since Rhoades took over as the Nittany Lions\u2019 coach in 2023-24, Penn State has hosted a \u201cReturn to Rec\u201d promotion, which features one game inside Rec Hall per season. Notably, Penn State took down No. 12 Illinois on Feb. 21, 2024, by a score of 90-89 after game-winning free throws by forward Zach Hicks.</p>\n                <p>Fans stormed the court after the Nittany Lions\u2019 upset over the Fighting Illini.</p>\n                <p>\u201cThis is entertainment, right? And it's supposed to be about having a cool experience,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cYeah, we want to win, and we want to do everything right, but we also want to make some decisions, so we're having a lot of fun trying to do this. I think playing in Rec Hall for a lot of people, old Penn Staters, new Penn Staters, basketball fans, it's a cool place to see a college basketball game, and it's cool for our players to be a part of that.\u201d</p>\n                <p>Rhoades said it\u2019s a possibility to play more than one game per season at Rec Hall, but noted the logistical needs of playing more games in the historic site.</p>\n                <p>\u201cA lot of things come into play with moving a team or a program out of one building to another, and logistics and how much it impacts,\u201d Rhoades said. \u201cThen you have marketing and ticket sales and season ticket sales. I think there's a lot more to it than just say, \u2018Hey, let's go play.\u2019 Some of that is above my pay grade.\u201d</p>\n                <p>MORE BASKETBALL COVERAGE</p>",

He just finished up his redshirt freshman campaign, leaving him up to three more years to develop as he makes the jump to the FBS.</p>\n                <p>Here\u2019s a look into the skills Jones could bring with him to Penn State.</p>\n                <p>Jump-ball ability</p>\n                <p>Jones has the ability to win 50-50 reps, hauling in passes over opposing defensive backs down the field.</p>\n                <p>Against Prairie View A&amp;M, Jones had a 16-yard reception with a cornerback in tight coverage with him. He high pointed the pass and secured the catch for a touchdown.</p>\n                <p>Jones possesses a jump-ball trait, bringing down 50-50 passes.Here\u2019s him hauling in a jump ball for a touchdown:<a href=\"https://t.co/5yn2TdS84Y\">pic.twitter.com/5yn2TdS84Y</a>&mdash; Collegian Football (@psufootblog) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/psufootblog/status/2013386217954464194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 19, 2026</a></p>\n                <p>Jones is listed at 6-foot-4, 185 pounds, which gives him a frame that has outsized competition.
